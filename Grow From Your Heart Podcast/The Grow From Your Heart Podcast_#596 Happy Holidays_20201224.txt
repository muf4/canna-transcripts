[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  Happy holidays, you bad motherfuckers.
[00:01.840 --> 00:04.960]  I'm Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 596
[00:04.960 --> 00:07.000]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.720]  This is the Christmas Eve episode.
[00:08.720 --> 00:10.440]  I hope you're sipping some hot cocoa.
[00:10.440 --> 00:11.760]  I hope you got to eat some good food.
[00:11.760 --> 00:13.720]  I hope you're surrounded by beautiful people.
[00:13.720 --> 00:16.000]  I hope you got all of the gifts you asked for.
[00:16.000 --> 00:16.840]  And most importantly,
[00:16.840 --> 00:20.240]  I hope your eyes are as red as my Santa hat.
[00:20.240 --> 00:22.360]  I wanna start off this show by saying thank you.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.200]  Christmas is the season of giving,
[00:24.200 --> 00:26.840]  and I have been spoiled with generosity.
[00:26.840 --> 00:29.520]  I am overwhelmed with the generosity and support
[00:29.640 --> 00:31.880]  which I have received from my community recently.
[00:31.880 --> 00:32.920]  So thank you.
[00:32.920 --> 00:34.680]  It all started off with this beautiful
[00:34.680 --> 00:36.520]  iRegenetics logo here behind me.
[00:36.520 --> 00:39.360]  Thanks to EZ057 for sending me that artwork.
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.320]  That was the first Christmas gift I received
[00:41.320 --> 00:43.360]  from the listeners, and it means a lot to me.
[00:43.360 --> 00:44.360]  So thank you.
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.360]  Then that was followed up by a pair of custom
[00:47.360 --> 00:49.680]  Grow From Your Heart podcast drumsticks.
[00:49.680 --> 00:51.680]  I do not know who this came from.
[00:51.680 --> 00:53.480]  I got a package in the mail today,
[00:53.480 --> 00:56.960]  and all that was in the package was these drumsticks.
[00:56.960 --> 00:58.600]  They're wrapped in a little sleeve here
[00:58.600 --> 00:59.600]  to keep them together.
[00:59.600 --> 01:02.440]  It says, do a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me
[01:02.440 --> 01:04.200]  on one stick, and the other one says
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.160]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast with iRegenetics.
[01:07.160 --> 01:08.840]  I don't know who sent these to me,
[01:08.840 --> 01:10.800]  but this is a beautiful gift.
[01:10.800 --> 01:12.240]  This means the world to me.
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.360]  Podcasting, growing cannabis, and playing the drums
[01:15.360 --> 01:17.360]  are probably three of my top favorite things
[01:17.360 --> 01:18.860]  that I can talk about in public.
[01:18.860 --> 01:19.700]  So thank you.
[01:19.700 --> 01:21.560]  I truly appreciate this gift.
[01:21.560 --> 01:24.620]  This is fucking perfect, and it means a lot to me.
[01:24.620 --> 01:27.440]  This will be displayed where I see it quite often
[01:27.440 --> 01:28.880]  because I really like this.
[01:28.880 --> 01:32.080]  So from the bottom of my big Rasta man heart, thank you.
[01:32.080 --> 01:33.080]  This is a great gift.
[01:33.080 --> 01:34.900]  I just wanna know who sent it.
[01:34.900 --> 01:37.700]  There was nothing in the package except these drumsticks.
[01:37.700 --> 01:40.000]  There was not a thank you, a you're welcome.
[01:40.000 --> 01:42.320]  There was not a Christmas card, no receipt.
[01:42.320 --> 01:43.740]  I just know where it came from.
[01:43.740 --> 01:46.040]  It came from the company that makes it.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.840]  No details on who sent it to me.
[01:47.840 --> 01:49.840]  So if you sent me this, thank you,
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.520]  and send me a little note so I know
[01:51.520 --> 01:52.980]  who to say thank you to.
[01:52.980 --> 01:55.040]  Also, I don't know if this person
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.520]  wants their name said on the air.
[01:56.520 --> 01:58.840]  I got a beautiful gift in the PO box today.
[01:58.840 --> 02:02.060]  This is a handmade, a hand-knitted hat
[02:02.060 --> 02:03.280]  that will fit my dreadlocks.
[02:03.280 --> 02:04.980]  I can wear this in a couple of different styles.
[02:04.980 --> 02:06.500]  I could fit the dreads up in there,
[02:06.500 --> 02:08.760]  or I could flip it up and have it more beanie style
[02:08.760 --> 02:10.560]  like the Santa hat that I'm wearing.
[02:10.560 --> 02:11.620]  This is a beautiful gift.
[02:11.620 --> 02:13.480]  I really appreciate this because I can tell
[02:13.480 --> 02:15.880]  this was handmade for me.
[02:15.880 --> 02:19.580]  It's big for my big old head, and it is my chosen colors.
[02:19.580 --> 02:21.040]  You can tell if you watch the show a lot,
[02:21.040 --> 02:23.300]  you know I wear a lot of blues and a lot of grays.
[02:23.300 --> 02:25.080]  This is blue and gray.
[02:25.080 --> 02:26.840]  This is going to match most of my outfit.
[02:26.840 --> 02:28.440]  Kind of looks good with the shirt that I'm wearing today.
[02:28.440 --> 02:30.240]  That was not planned at all.
[02:30.240 --> 02:32.400]  So big thank you shout out to the friend who sent me this.
[02:32.400 --> 02:35.440]  I don't know if you want me to say your name on the podcast,
[02:35.440 --> 02:36.480]  but I do appreciate you.
[02:36.480 --> 02:37.800]  This is beautiful.
[02:37.800 --> 02:39.240]  It's nice and soft, nice and cozy.
[02:39.240 --> 02:42.060]  It's going to fit me very well, and it smells amazing.
[02:42.060 --> 02:43.860]  It's got some essential oils in it,
[02:43.860 --> 02:45.380]  so it's got a nice aroma to it.
[02:45.380 --> 02:46.520]  Nice lemongrass flavor.
[02:46.520 --> 02:48.440]  Should keep me nice and calm when I wear it.
[02:48.440 --> 02:49.280]  Thank you.
[02:49.280 --> 02:51.860]  These gifts do mean the world to me.
[02:51.860 --> 02:54.280]  It means a lot that you guys are compelled
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.760]  and inspired to send me gifts.
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.200]  We've never met in person.
[02:57.200 --> 02:59.780]  You only know me through the show or through social media,
[02:59.780 --> 03:02.660]  and to get gifts in the mail from you is overwhelming,
[03:02.660 --> 03:03.620]  and it means a lot to me.
[03:03.620 --> 03:05.220]  So seriously, thank you guys.
[03:05.220 --> 03:06.360]  I tell a lot of jokes.
[03:06.360 --> 03:08.220]  I'm kind of a smart ass quite often.
[03:08.220 --> 03:10.540]  This time I'm being 100% serious.
[03:10.540 --> 03:11.380]  Thank you.
[03:11.380 --> 03:12.600]  These gifts mean a lot.
[03:12.600 --> 03:14.560]  They put a huge smile on my face.
[03:14.560 --> 03:15.400]  So thank you.
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.560]  Happy holidays, happy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas,
[03:18.560 --> 03:21.080]  happy Kwanzaa, whatever it is you celebrate.
[03:21.080 --> 03:23.120]  Thank you, and happy holiday to you
[03:23.120 --> 03:24.720]  for all of the support.
[03:24.720 --> 03:26.080]  Where do we go from there?
[03:26.080 --> 03:28.080]  I also wanna say thank you to everybody
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.880]  who gave me feedback on the last episode.
[03:30.880 --> 03:33.300]  I did use a different camera setting on the last episode.
[03:33.300 --> 03:35.960]  I felt like that video came out beautifully.
[03:35.960 --> 03:37.280]  I do like the camera settings.
[03:37.280 --> 03:38.200]  I like those adjustments.
[03:38.200 --> 03:39.880]  I've got the lights right where I need them.
[03:39.880 --> 03:42.640]  I think we've got the podcast kind of dialed in.
[03:42.640 --> 03:44.080]  Now it's time to decorate around here
[03:44.080 --> 03:45.340]  and do a little bit of stuff like that,
[03:45.340 --> 03:48.540]  but thank you for all of the feedback, all of the support.
[03:48.540 --> 03:51.000]  I really liked the way that video came out.
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.320]  This video will be edited on the brand new Mac mini.
[03:54.320 --> 03:55.880]  The Mac mini finally made it here.
[03:55.880 --> 03:57.480]  So this video will be the first one
[03:57.480 --> 03:59.240]  that I edit on that Mac mini.
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.520]  I'm going to throw this video into iMovie,
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.700]  my old editing software,
[04:02.700 --> 04:05.920]  and see how much faster the editing process is in iMovie
[04:05.920 --> 04:08.040]  just because I wanna compare the two computers.
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.740]  Once I see how much more quickly I can process in iMovie,
[04:11.740 --> 04:13.760]  then I get to learn Final Cut Pro.
[04:13.760 --> 04:16.320]  So expect some video edits and improvements
[04:16.320 --> 04:18.800]  in the video here in the near future.
[04:18.800 --> 04:20.480]  Also, also, excuse me for that.
[04:20.920 --> 04:22.760]  Also, bear with me and be patient with me
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.760]  while I learn Final Cut Pro.
[04:24.760 --> 04:26.640]  I've opened up that application one time
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.660]  and there's a lot going on.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.980]  So I've got a lot to learn.
[04:29.980 --> 04:31.860]  Have no fear, I'm good at learning programs.
[04:31.860 --> 04:34.480]  You guys have watched me evolve and watched me learn
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.080]  full-on video podcasting over the course
[04:37.080 --> 04:38.800]  of six or eight months.
[04:38.800 --> 04:40.380]  So there've been a lot of changes
[04:40.380 --> 04:42.760]  and there will continue to be more changes and improvements.
[04:42.760 --> 04:44.200]  I am not afraid.
[04:44.200 --> 04:45.560]  We're just gonna get better from here.
[04:45.560 --> 04:48.120]  So thank you for all of the words of encouragement
[04:48.120 --> 04:50.480]  and all of the feedback on the last episode.
[04:50.480 --> 04:52.440]  And I'm looking for that again in the future
[04:52.440 --> 04:54.920]  because I'm going to continue to make changes.
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.820]  If anything falls apart, if the audio quality goes to shit,
[04:57.820 --> 05:00.000]  if the video starts sucking, if you don't like the show
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.520]  because I'm not living up to my standards, say something.
[05:02.520 --> 05:04.800]  I rely on you guys to give me feedback.
[05:04.800 --> 05:07.760]  If you say, hey bro, that video was sloppy, let me know.
[05:07.760 --> 05:09.200]  Check me, keep me in check.
[05:09.200 --> 05:10.440]  I count on you guys for that.
[05:10.440 --> 05:12.320]  There are some of you who are not shy.
[05:12.320 --> 05:14.040]  You'll send me messages immediately
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.460]  and let me know what you don't like.
[05:16.460 --> 05:18.780]  I'm confident in who I am and what I'm doing.
[05:18.780 --> 05:21.900]  And if you have constructive criticism, I take it very well.
[05:21.900 --> 05:23.180]  If you're just gonna tell me that I'm ugly
[05:23.180 --> 05:24.660]  and to get some sun and shit like that,
[05:24.660 --> 05:25.500]  keep that to yourself.
[05:25.500 --> 05:26.640]  I know I need some sun, bro.
[05:26.640 --> 05:27.760]  It's winter time, it's cold.
[05:27.760 --> 05:29.020]  I'd love some sun.
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.220]  Sell me a bag of sunshine.
[05:30.220 --> 05:31.580]  I'll fucking rub it all over my face,
[05:31.580 --> 05:33.300]  but it's like 20 degrees out there.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.620]  So sun is hard to get right now.
[05:34.620 --> 05:36.340]  I know I'm pale and pasty, bro.
[05:36.340 --> 05:37.560]  Don't get shy.
[05:37.560 --> 05:38.700]  Anyway, or don't get whatever.
[05:38.700 --> 05:39.700]  Let's keep moving.
[05:39.700 --> 05:40.920]  Send me words of encouragement.
[05:40.920 --> 05:42.100]  Don't keep telling me I'm pasty.
[05:42.100 --> 05:43.780]  I already know that, but thank you.
[05:43.780 --> 05:45.740]  Also, thanks to everybody who watched
[05:45.740 --> 05:49.440]  the Canna Buzz Very Irie Christmas Special.
[05:49.440 --> 05:52.200]  We got a huge response on Canna Buzz
[05:52.200 --> 05:56.240]  to the Irie Genetics Rasta Jeff Very Irie Christmas Special
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.260]  that is still available on Canna Buzz.
[05:58.260 --> 05:59.540]  Shout out to Q Grows.
[05:59.540 --> 06:00.660]  Shout out to JR Token.
[06:00.660 --> 06:03.940]  They did a wonderful job interviewing me on that show.
[06:03.940 --> 06:05.460]  A lot of great questions.
[06:05.460 --> 06:07.580]  I feel like I did a very good job myself,
[06:07.580 --> 06:08.820]  not to toot my own horn.
[06:08.820 --> 06:11.120]  I feel like I've evolved so far as a podcaster
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.100]  that I'm so comfortable on a microphone
[06:13.140 --> 06:14.780]  that when I didn't have to host that show,
[06:14.780 --> 06:16.940]  when I was just chilling out answering questions,
[06:16.940 --> 06:18.760]  I feel like I really got to have a good time,
[06:18.760 --> 06:19.940]  hang out with my friends.
[06:19.940 --> 06:23.340]  So shout out once again to Q Grows and JR Token
[06:23.340 --> 06:24.260]  from Canna Buzz.
[06:24.260 --> 06:26.560]  And also thanks to everybody who watched
[06:26.560 --> 06:30.820]  the Canna Buzz Very Irie Christmas Special.
[06:30.820 --> 06:33.740]  Also, big shout out to everybody who has joined
[06:33.740 --> 06:36.820]  Canna Buzz in the past weekend or so.
[06:36.820 --> 06:40.180]  We're seeing a huge spike in Canna Buzz users and members,
[06:40.180 --> 06:42.340]  and I appreciate you jumping on.
[06:42.340 --> 06:44.380]  I feel like I, I'm not gonna take a lot of credit,
[06:44.380 --> 06:45.540]  but I mean, I talk about it a lot.
[06:45.540 --> 06:46.780]  I've been trying to get people moving.
[06:46.780 --> 06:50.300]  So thank you for finally following me over to Canna Buzz.
[06:50.300 --> 06:52.060]  Instagram has been shutting down accounts.
[06:52.060 --> 06:53.820]  Instagram has been deleting posts.
[06:53.820 --> 06:54.740]  They're at it again.
[06:54.740 --> 06:56.340]  Once in a while, Instagram just decides
[06:56.340 --> 06:57.780]  they need to clean up their shit.
[06:57.780 --> 07:00.100]  They go through and delete a bunch of cannabis content.
[07:00.100 --> 07:02.140]  They're also deleting a bunch of booty pics.
[07:02.140 --> 07:04.440]  That's not relevant, but Instagram is cleaning up,
[07:04.440 --> 07:06.600]  so it is time to jump over to Canna Buzz.
[07:06.600 --> 07:07.620]  Join me on Canna Buzz.
[07:07.620 --> 07:10.180]  Canna Buzz is a free social media application
[07:10.180 --> 07:13.340]  where we encourage you to post your cannabis content.
[07:13.340 --> 07:15.500]  You can't buy, sell, or trade cannabis over there,
[07:15.500 --> 07:17.740]  but you can post your dab videos.
[07:17.740 --> 07:19.100]  You could post your plant pictures.
[07:19.100 --> 07:23.260]  You could post your dried and cured bud shots.
[07:23.260 --> 07:26.500]  Anything cannabis related, you can post that on Canna Buzz,
[07:26.500 --> 07:27.940]  and we will not scrutinize you.
[07:27.940 --> 07:28.780]  We encourage it.
[07:28.780 --> 07:30.020]  We wanna see it.
[07:30.020 --> 07:31.580]  Instagram would've shut you down.
[07:31.580 --> 07:32.700]  We want all that stuff
[07:32.700 --> 07:34.420]  that Instagram would've shut you down for.
[07:34.420 --> 07:35.860]  So join us on Canna Buzz.
[07:35.860 --> 07:38.100]  Like I said, you can't buy, sell, or trade cannabis,
[07:38.100 --> 07:39.320]  but you can get great advice.
[07:39.320 --> 07:41.080]  You can be part of a great community.
[07:41.080 --> 07:42.000]  Join the buzz.
[07:42.000 --> 07:44.000]  Find us on Canna Buzz.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.480]  Where do we go from there?
[07:45.480 --> 07:47.840]  My notes are scrambled because I did not go in order,
[07:47.840 --> 07:49.440]  and I just heard a weird noise in my house
[07:49.440 --> 07:51.040]  that we're gonna hope wasn't too disastrous.
[07:51.040 --> 07:52.680]  I hope it didn't come through in the microphone.
[07:52.680 --> 07:53.960]  I have no idea what that was.
[07:53.960 --> 07:56.920]  We're gonna find out in like an hour what happened here.
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.940]  The Canna Buzz special.
[07:57.940 --> 08:01.000]  I gave away some prizes on the Canna Buzz special.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.420]  Those prizes, other than one order
[08:03.420 --> 08:04.860]  that I don't have your address yet.
[08:04.860 --> 08:07.400]  If you're watching this, I need your address, please.
[08:07.400 --> 08:10.320]  If you haven't sent your address from the Canna Buzz contest,
[08:10.320 --> 08:11.160]  please send me your address.
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.160]  I'll get your last prize out.
[08:12.160 --> 08:14.040]  All of those prizes have been sent.
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.200]  They are in the mail.
[08:15.200 --> 08:17.160]  Please be patient.
[08:17.160 --> 08:19.600]  The mail is broken right now.
[08:19.600 --> 08:21.640]  The Postal Service, the UPS,
[08:21.640 --> 08:23.000]  and the United States Postal Service
[08:23.000 --> 08:26.320]  are receiving 60% of an increase
[08:26.320 --> 08:28.160]  in package deliveries this year.
[08:28.160 --> 08:29.160]  We can't go shopping.
[08:29.160 --> 08:30.640]  We can't do most of our own shopping.
[08:30.640 --> 08:32.280]  We can't deliver gifts ourselves
[08:32.280 --> 08:34.360]  because of this weird COVID situation.
[08:34.360 --> 08:37.880]  So the Post Office and the UPS and DHL and FedEx
[08:37.880 --> 08:39.920]  are doing all of that stuff for us,
[08:39.920 --> 08:41.920]  but shit is running behind.
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.360]  Please be polite, passionate, patient, courteous
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.800]  with all of the mail carriers and delivery people,
[08:49.800 --> 08:51.880]  even the grocery people who are bringing your groceries,
[08:51.880 --> 08:52.920]  even Grubhub.
[08:52.920 --> 08:55.960]  They deserve an extra high five, an extra tip,
[08:55.960 --> 08:58.120]  at least a little extra patience with them right now.
[08:58.120 --> 08:59.480]  Deliveries are going to be late.
[08:59.480 --> 09:00.760]  Things are going to be weird.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.360]  Please be patient.
[09:02.360 --> 09:04.560]  If you're waiting on a package in the mail,
[09:04.560 --> 09:05.960]  don't stroke out over it.
[09:05.960 --> 09:07.240]  Don't have a panic attack.
[09:07.240 --> 09:09.040]  It's in Jaa's hands now.
[09:09.040 --> 09:11.320]  It will get there when it's supposed to get there.
[09:11.320 --> 09:12.240]  Everything is a mess.
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.840]  All the tracking numbers I've been looking at
[09:13.840 --> 09:15.880]  say your package has been sitting at this place
[09:15.880 --> 09:16.920]  for three days.
[09:16.920 --> 09:19.000]  So everything is at a standstill.
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.480]  Everything is challenging right now.
[09:20.480 --> 09:23.400]  Please, what I'm getting at is in the Christmas time,
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.280]  in the COVID time, we all need to be a little bit
[09:25.280 --> 09:27.920]  more patient, more compassionate with each other,
[09:27.920 --> 09:30.040]  with ourselves, with those that are around us,
[09:30.040 --> 09:32.800]  especially the people that are doing a service for us.
[09:32.800 --> 09:35.000]  We've gotten used to just expecting the mail to come.
[09:35.000 --> 09:36.400]  We take that for granted.
[09:36.400 --> 09:39.280]  The mail person, the mail carrier has a family also.
[09:39.280 --> 09:40.600]  They want to go home and smoke a bowl
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.920]  just as bad as you do.
[09:41.920 --> 09:42.760]  They got shit to do.
[09:42.760 --> 09:43.600]  They're overwhelmed.
[09:43.600 --> 09:45.200]  Let's not be a dick to them.
[09:45.200 --> 09:47.920]  Let's try to tip them and give them a bonus where we can
[09:47.920 --> 09:50.200]  if we're able to in these weird times.
[09:50.200 --> 09:52.280]  Just make life easier for everybody right now.
[09:52.280 --> 09:53.680]  We don't need to make shit harder.
[09:53.680 --> 09:54.880]  Life is hard enough right now.
[09:54.880 --> 09:56.280]  Speaking of making life easier,
[09:56.280 --> 09:57.440]  if you do celebrate Christmas,
[09:57.440 --> 09:59.000]  don't forget to leave out some milk and cookies
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.920]  and a fat dab for Santa Claus.
[10:00.920 --> 10:02.880]  That's always good karma for next year.
[10:02.880 --> 10:04.040]  Where are we going from there?
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.360]  I've got so much stuff written down
[10:05.360 --> 10:07.240]  and I'm way off track on my notes here.
[10:07.240 --> 10:10.000]  Discord, on the last episode,
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.840]  I talked about some friends of ours that created
[10:11.840 --> 10:14.320]  an iRegenetics Discord page.
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.800]  A lot of people then said, how do I get to that?
[10:16.800 --> 10:19.200]  Honestly, I am brand new to Discord
[10:19.200 --> 10:20.840]  and I haven't spent a lot of time on there
[10:20.840 --> 10:23.160]  because I'm overwhelmed myself with podcasting,
[10:23.160 --> 10:25.400]  with the grow, with holiday stuff.
[10:25.400 --> 10:26.280]  Just have a lot going on.
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.120]  I'm not complaining.
[10:27.120 --> 10:27.960]  I like being busy.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.240]  Being busy means that I've got stuff to do.
[10:30.240 --> 10:31.080]  I've got an income.
[10:31.080 --> 10:31.920]  I got a job.
[10:31.920 --> 10:32.760]  A lot of people don't have that,
[10:32.760 --> 10:34.800]  but I have not been on the Discord a lot.
[10:34.800 --> 10:36.120]  I am brand new to Discord.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.000]  I am learning it just like you are.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.680]  The thing I can do to help you is I will include
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.640]  the Discord link in this podcast video description.
[10:44.640 --> 10:47.240]  So many people ask me, how do I find Discord?
[10:47.240 --> 10:48.560]  When I posted the last show,
[10:48.560 --> 10:50.200]  I didn't know how to find Discord.
[10:50.200 --> 10:52.080]  So now I've got a link for you.
[10:52.080 --> 10:53.600]  I'll put that in the show notes.
[10:53.600 --> 10:56.120]  You will be able to get to that part.
[10:56.120 --> 10:58.160]  I do have a lot more rambling to do,
[10:58.160 --> 11:00.040]  but this is the part where I'm going to give shout outs
[11:00.040 --> 11:01.240]  to the 710 Club.
[11:01.240 --> 11:03.120]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks
[11:03.120 --> 11:04.800]  who support the show on Patreon
[11:04.800 --> 11:07.400]  at $7.10 a month or higher.
[11:07.400 --> 11:08.560]  So let's start off with the big
[11:08.560 --> 11:10.360]  Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.280]  to a new supporter with a very unique name,
[11:13.280 --> 11:15.000]  a name I will never forget.
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.860]  Let's send a big shout out to our friend Boner Soldier.
[11:18.860 --> 11:20.300]  Yes, Boner Soldier.
[11:20.300 --> 11:21.680]  Shout out, Boner Soldier.
[11:21.680 --> 11:24.320]  My first question was, was that Major Boner?
[11:24.320 --> 11:25.480]  Commander Boner?
[11:25.480 --> 11:26.660]  Captain Boner?
[11:26.660 --> 11:28.080]  You can have way too much fun with that.
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.880]  Shout out to our friend Boner Soldier.
[11:29.880 --> 11:31.360]  Let's follow that one up with a big shout out
[11:31.360 --> 11:32.420]  to Jesse Grose.
[11:32.420 --> 11:33.880]  Shout out, Jesse.
[11:33.880 --> 11:37.560]  Not just a podcast supporter, but a real true friend.
[11:37.560 --> 11:39.320]  Jesse and I have known each other for years.
[11:39.320 --> 11:40.800]  That dude's from around here.
[11:40.800 --> 11:43.400]  We had a really cool conversation the other day.
[11:43.400 --> 11:46.120]  Don't ever think you're not in my history book, Jesse.
[11:46.120 --> 11:48.680]  When I write about cannabis history, you are part of that.
[11:48.680 --> 11:49.660]  You're from my neighborhood.
[11:49.660 --> 11:51.300]  We are pioneers together, brother.
[11:51.300 --> 11:52.880]  Big shout out to Jesse Grose.
[11:52.880 --> 11:54.240]  Let's follow that up with a thank you shout out
[11:55.080 --> 11:55.920]  to Frank Buckley.
[11:55.920 --> 11:57.800]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Riven Waters.
[11:57.800 --> 11:58.840]  I hope I said that correctly.
[11:58.840 --> 12:00.840]  It could be Riven Waters, Riven Waters.
[12:00.840 --> 12:03.120]  However you say it, I got nothing but love and respect
[12:03.120 --> 12:04.520]  for you, thank you for the support.
[12:04.520 --> 12:06.120]  Let's follow that up with a thank you shout out
[12:06.120 --> 12:07.520]  to Nugletron.
[12:07.520 --> 12:09.060]  I don't know what a Nugletron is,
[12:09.060 --> 12:10.920]  but I want one for Christmas.
[12:10.920 --> 12:12.640]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Dolan.
[12:12.640 --> 12:14.600]  Let's send a thank you shout out to TreeumUp.
[12:14.600 --> 12:17.680]  Let's send a thank you shout out to OP7420.
[12:17.680 --> 12:20.160]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Virus Smurf.
[12:20.160 --> 12:22.380]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Levity Love Day.
[12:22.380 --> 12:24.400]  And last, but certainly not least,
[12:24.400 --> 12:26.000]  let's send a big thank you shout out
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.620]  to my friend D.Brazil.
[12:28.620 --> 12:30.420]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[12:30.420 --> 12:32.260]  who supports the show on Patreon.
[12:32.260 --> 12:34.500]  Of course, if you're not already supporting the show,
[12:34.500 --> 12:38.580]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[12:38.580 --> 12:40.380]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[12:40.380 --> 12:41.780]  There are a lot of different tiers
[12:41.780 --> 12:43.380]  at which you can support the show.
[12:43.380 --> 12:46.080]  Find the tier that suits your budget the best,
[12:46.080 --> 12:48.140]  sign up, and contribute to the podcast,
[12:48.140 --> 12:49.940]  and I'll give you a shout out on the show
[12:49.940 --> 12:52.580]  if you join the 710 Club or higher.
[12:52.580 --> 12:54.940]  Also, if you want to get your messages to me directly,
[12:54.940 --> 12:58.860]  Patreon is the best way to get those messages on the podcast.
[12:58.860 --> 13:02.820]  I read the Patreon messages first, just to be fair.
[13:02.820 --> 13:04.780]  All right, thank you guys for all the Patreon support.
[13:04.780 --> 13:06.100]  That does mean a lot to me,
[13:06.100 --> 13:07.800]  especially during these holidays.
[13:07.800 --> 13:09.660]  You guys need to buy gifts for your kids,
[13:09.660 --> 13:12.300]  your family, your mama, some of you your baby mama,
[13:12.300 --> 13:13.660]  some of you your baby daddy,
[13:13.660 --> 13:15.660]  some of you your side chick and your side dude.
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.100]  You got a lot of gifts to buy,
[13:17.100 --> 13:19.140]  and if you're still able to contribute to the podcast,
[13:19.140 --> 13:20.300]  that is awesome of you.
[13:20.300 --> 13:21.140]  Thank you.
[13:21.140 --> 13:22.620]  I know that money is expensive.
[13:22.620 --> 13:23.960]  I know that things are rough out there.
[13:23.960 --> 13:26.720]  Money isn't as abundant as it used to be, so thank you.
[13:26.720 --> 13:28.460]  I do know that people are struggling.
[13:28.460 --> 13:30.820]  I do know that people are working hard for their money.
[13:30.820 --> 13:32.300]  You got to go somewhere you don't want to be
[13:32.300 --> 13:34.060]  and deal with people you don't want to deal with
[13:34.060 --> 13:36.020]  and get told what to do by somebody
[13:36.020 --> 13:38.340]  you probably don't want to hear some bullshit from.
[13:38.340 --> 13:40.420]  You probably just want to go home and play the new Xbox
[13:40.420 --> 13:42.740]  or play the new PlayStation and take a couple of dabs,
[13:42.740 --> 13:44.060]  spend some time with your family,
[13:44.060 --> 13:46.220]  play with your puppy or whatever you're going to do.
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.060]  I get it.
[13:47.060 --> 13:48.500]  You're stuck at work to make the money,
[13:48.500 --> 13:51.740]  and then you spend some of that money on my podcast.
[13:51.740 --> 13:52.580]  I understand.
[13:52.580 --> 13:53.900]  That is not lost on me.
[13:53.900 --> 13:56.300]  I appreciate the hell out of that.
[13:56.300 --> 13:57.140]  Thank you.
[13:57.140 --> 13:57.960]  Big thank you.
[13:57.960 --> 13:59.680]  Straight faced, big eyes, thank you.
[13:59.680 --> 14:01.140]  That stuff does mean a lot to me.
[14:01.140 --> 14:03.360]  I know that money is expensive.
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.340]  You got to give them your time.
[14:04.340 --> 14:06.600]  The only way to get money is to work,
[14:06.600 --> 14:07.780]  and working isn't fun.
[14:07.780 --> 14:08.660]  That's why it's called work.
[14:08.660 --> 14:09.860]  We'd rather be having fun, right?
[14:09.860 --> 14:12.520]  So thank you for giving me the money that you work for.
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.020]  I do appreciate that.
[14:14.020 --> 14:15.460]  I try to put it back into the show.
[14:15.460 --> 14:17.260]  You can see the fancy lights behind the camera.
[14:17.260 --> 14:19.300]  You can see the dope ass camera that I've got.
[14:19.300 --> 14:20.260]  We painted.
[14:20.260 --> 14:21.620]  I got a new computer.
[14:21.620 --> 14:24.220]  You guys have bought me two computers.
[14:24.220 --> 14:26.180]  Patreon has bought two computers.
[14:26.180 --> 14:27.620]  That sounds crazy, right?
[14:27.620 --> 14:30.460]  I said on a long time ago, like two years ago,
[14:30.460 --> 14:32.260]  I said, hey, this computer's taking a shit,
[14:32.260 --> 14:34.100]  and it's hard to produce a podcast,
[14:34.100 --> 14:35.800]  and I'm getting frustrated.
[14:35.800 --> 14:38.020]  Patreon contributions started pouring in.
[14:38.020 --> 14:40.540]  I was able to pay for this MacBook right here
[14:40.540 --> 14:42.020]  with Patreon contributions.
[14:42.020 --> 14:43.820]  I walked in, I said, this is my budget,
[14:43.820 --> 14:45.380]  and they said, this is the computer you want
[14:45.380 --> 14:47.140]  for that budget, and I said, let's do it.
[14:47.980 --> 14:49.980]  This computer has lasted two years, and it is amazing.
[14:49.980 --> 14:51.300]  It works very well.
[14:51.300 --> 14:53.460]  I upgraded to the 4K camera.
[14:53.460 --> 14:56.380]  When I started dumping those 4K videos into this computer,
[14:56.380 --> 14:59.180]  this computer started smoking and making weird noises.
[14:59.180 --> 15:00.540]  It was like, hey, I'm a good computer,
[15:00.540 --> 15:02.300]  but you're asking a lot of me.
[15:02.300 --> 15:03.620]  So I did some research.
[15:03.620 --> 15:05.340]  I talked to a few of our tech nerds.
[15:05.340 --> 15:07.020]  Shout out to Reefer Mattness.
[15:07.020 --> 15:08.180]  Shout out to Tony.
[15:08.180 --> 15:09.620]  Shout out to a lot of people that helped me out,
[15:09.620 --> 15:13.520]  but they guided me toward the Mac Mini with the M1 chip.
[15:13.520 --> 15:15.220]  So yesterday in the mail,
[15:15.220 --> 15:17.660]  I received a Mac Mini with an M1 chip.
[15:17.660 --> 15:18.900]  It is set up now.
[15:18.900 --> 15:21.460]  I think it's probably downloading updates as we speak,
[15:21.460 --> 15:23.020]  but by the time we get done here,
[15:23.020 --> 15:24.100]  I'll get to go play with that.
[15:24.100 --> 15:26.460]  I'm going to edit this video in that machine
[15:26.460 --> 15:27.860]  like I talked about before.
[15:27.860 --> 15:29.960]  So that was from you guys.
[15:29.960 --> 15:32.060]  You guys covered the cost of that new Mac.
[15:32.060 --> 15:32.900]  So thank you.
[15:32.900 --> 15:34.420]  Without you, that would not have happened.
[15:34.420 --> 15:36.380]  I would have to have dug into my pocket and pulled that out,
[15:36.380 --> 15:38.460]  and right now that might not be in the budget
[15:38.460 --> 15:39.940]  because it's Christmas time,
[15:39.940 --> 15:41.840]  and I gotta get gifts for all those people
[15:41.840 --> 15:43.700]  we talked about before.
[15:43.700 --> 15:45.000]  So thank you.
[15:45.780 --> 15:46.600]  Patreon does mean a lot to me.
[15:46.600 --> 15:47.800]  Your support does mean a lot to me.
[15:47.800 --> 15:49.880]  Without you, we wouldn't have seen these upgrades.
[15:49.880 --> 15:52.060]  The paint, the lights, the microphone.
[15:52.060 --> 15:53.360]  This mic was not cheap.
[15:53.360 --> 15:55.040]  You guys, I'm not trying to brag about cost,
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.800]  but the Joe Rogan mic is,
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.360]  you gotta buy into that club.
[15:59.360 --> 16:00.400]  All right, where are we going from here?
[16:00.400 --> 16:01.800]  Let's get serious.
[16:01.800 --> 16:03.800]  2021 is coming, you guys.
[16:03.800 --> 16:05.880]  2020 kinda, for a lot of people,
[16:05.880 --> 16:08.280]  2020 kinda sucked real bad.
[16:08.280 --> 16:10.180]  I'm very blessed that I stayed.
[16:10.180 --> 16:11.160]  I didn't sink.
[16:11.160 --> 16:12.240]  I didn't climb to the top.
[16:12.240 --> 16:13.460]  I kinda stayed even keel.
[16:13.460 --> 16:15.300]  I tried to keep my head to myself,
[16:15.300 --> 16:16.580]  keep my head together,
[16:16.580 --> 16:18.660]  and not let myself get out of control,
[16:18.660 --> 16:20.540]  but a lot of people had a rough 2021.
[16:20.540 --> 16:22.460]  This year is almost over.
[16:22.460 --> 16:25.020]  I'm hoping that this was the year of bullshit.
[16:25.020 --> 16:26.420]  Or no, 2020 is almost over.
[16:26.420 --> 16:27.240]  I don't know what I said.
[16:27.240 --> 16:28.960]  I'm reading and talking at the same time.
[16:28.960 --> 16:29.800]  I'm only human.
[16:29.800 --> 16:30.680]  I'm gonna make some mistakes,
[16:30.680 --> 16:32.660]  but 2020's almost over.
[16:32.660 --> 16:34.500]  2021 is coming up brand new.
[16:34.500 --> 16:36.860]  Hopefully it's not jinxed or cursed
[16:36.860 --> 16:38.820]  or whatever the fuck happened to this year.
[16:38.820 --> 16:40.980]  Hopefully we get a fresh new year.
[16:41.020 --> 16:43.900]  What I'm getting at is you gotta be good all year.
[16:43.900 --> 16:45.660]  You can't just be good around Christmas time
[16:45.660 --> 16:47.180]  and hope for some good Christmas karma.
[16:47.180 --> 16:51.040]  We need to be good people 365 days a year.
[16:51.040 --> 16:53.500]  When I was talking about being nice to the postal workers,
[16:53.500 --> 16:55.980]  to the Postmates folks, to the Grubhub drivers,
[16:55.980 --> 16:59.500]  do that 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,
[16:59.500 --> 17:02.100]  and see how good you feel as a person.
[17:02.100 --> 17:04.020]  When you're nicer to other people,
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.100]  this weird little thing in the world comes back
[17:06.100 --> 17:09.300]  and makes the world nicer to you.
[17:09.300 --> 17:10.820]  Well, I did a podcast for free.
[17:11.660 --> 17:12.500]  I gave out a bunch of information.
[17:12.500 --> 17:13.580]  I was super nice to a bunch of people.
[17:13.580 --> 17:15.500]  Look, I got a dope ass hat.
[17:15.500 --> 17:16.700]  I got a cool painting.
[17:16.700 --> 17:18.760]  I got some brand new drumsticks out of the deal
[17:18.760 --> 17:20.160]  just for being nice to people.
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.940]  Karma goes in circles, you guys.
[17:21.940 --> 17:25.160]  So I know sometimes you just wanna cuss somebody out.
[17:25.160 --> 17:26.900]  Sometimes you wanna fucking kick something.
[17:26.900 --> 17:29.540]  Sometimes you just wanna throw some dishes at somebody.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.660]  What's that gonna do?
[17:30.660 --> 17:32.260]  It's gonna create that negative loop.
[17:32.260 --> 17:33.220]  Let's be a good person.
[17:33.220 --> 17:34.900]  Let's try to shake all that shit off.
[17:34.900 --> 17:37.700]  Let's go into 2020 with the most positive outlook,
[17:37.700 --> 17:39.600]  positive attitude we can have.
[17:39.600 --> 17:41.320]  Because when you laugh at the dumb shit,
[17:41.320 --> 17:42.640]  the dumb shit laughs back and goes,
[17:42.640 --> 17:44.120]  you're right, I can't get to you.
[17:44.120 --> 17:44.960]  You're right.
[17:44.960 --> 17:45.960]  And then you create a little force field,
[17:45.960 --> 17:48.200]  a little bubble of goodness around yourself.
[17:48.200 --> 17:49.920]  And that little bubble of goodness,
[17:49.920 --> 17:51.200]  it only lets in goodness.
[17:51.200 --> 17:52.820]  And it's contagious also.
[17:52.820 --> 17:54.880]  If you rub up against some bullshit with your goodness,
[17:54.880 --> 17:57.360]  you got the opportunity to shine that bullshit
[17:57.360 --> 18:00.160]  with your goodness and the bullshit can't get near you.
[18:00.160 --> 18:01.840]  Mike used to call it my jaw bubble.
[18:01.840 --> 18:03.760]  Mike noticed that I've got a little protective
[18:03.760 --> 18:05.280]  karmic bubble around me
[18:05.280 --> 18:07.440]  because I do my best to be a good person.
[18:07.440 --> 18:09.360]  I'm not fucking perfect, you guys.
[18:10.120 --> 18:10.960]  I told somebody to fuck themselves
[18:10.960 --> 18:13.920]  in a text message the other day because they deserved it.
[18:13.920 --> 18:15.160]  So I'm not perfect.
[18:15.160 --> 18:16.260]  I'll say what needs to be said,
[18:16.260 --> 18:20.400]  but I do try to be the best person I can be at all times.
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.080]  Now, with that being said,
[18:22.080 --> 18:24.280]  2021 is a fresh year coming up.
[18:24.280 --> 18:26.720]  Now is the time to set some goals.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.840]  By the time you're listening to this,
[18:27.840 --> 18:30.760]  you've got a week until there's a brand new calendar year.
[18:30.760 --> 18:32.840]  We're gonna turn 2020 right behind us.
[18:32.840 --> 18:34.200]  It's gonna be on the back of the calendar.
[18:34.200 --> 18:36.480]  We're gonna look 2021 right in the face.
[18:36.480 --> 18:37.400]  Let's have some goals.
[18:37.400 --> 18:38.940]  Let's have some preparations.
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.360]  What are you gonna do in 2021?
[18:42.360 --> 18:44.360]  What didn't you accomplish in 2020?
[18:44.360 --> 18:45.840]  What did you fuck up in 2020?
[18:45.840 --> 18:47.400]  What did you suck at this year?
[18:47.400 --> 18:49.280]  Let's do that better next year.
[18:49.280 --> 18:51.880]  Let's set some goals, have some accomplishments.
[18:51.880 --> 18:53.940]  Also, while you're setting those goals
[18:53.940 --> 18:55.560]  and looking for accomplishments
[18:55.560 --> 18:58.480]  and ways to realize that you are making progress
[18:58.480 --> 18:59.540]  in your life, set some goals
[18:59.540 --> 19:00.800]  and then you know you're moving forward.
[19:00.800 --> 19:01.960]  If you don't have a goal,
[19:01.960 --> 19:04.080]  you may just stand still and not even know it.
[19:04.080 --> 19:06.720]  If you're doing something at level five,
[19:06.720 --> 19:08.320]  let's get to six or seven next year.
[19:08.320 --> 19:09.200]  If you're doing it at seven,
[19:09.200 --> 19:11.680]  let's be level 10 by the end of 2021.
[19:11.680 --> 19:13.620]  Let's improve ourselves this year.
[19:13.620 --> 19:15.680]  Also, with that being said,
[19:15.680 --> 19:19.280]  we've got to adjust and adapt to this new way of life.
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.480]  2021 is not going to be like 2019.
[19:23.480 --> 19:25.800]  It's not going to be like 2020.
[19:25.800 --> 19:26.840]  A lot of people keep saying,
[19:26.840 --> 19:29.480]  I want the world to get back to normal
[19:29.480 --> 19:34.380]  and I hate to be that guy, but this is the new normal.
[19:34.380 --> 19:37.340]  If you're waiting for things to go back like they were,
[19:37.340 --> 19:40.420]  you're fucking stuck and it's never going to be that way.
[19:40.420 --> 19:42.860]  I hate to tell you that, I hate to be that guy,
[19:42.860 --> 19:45.620]  but this is the new world and we've got to adjust
[19:45.620 --> 19:48.500]  and adapt to what the world is now.
[19:48.500 --> 19:50.700]  All of your old plans, it is okay now
[19:50.700 --> 19:52.520]  to go back and look at your goals and plans
[19:52.520 --> 19:54.540]  and scratch that shit out and say,
[19:54.540 --> 19:57.200]  well, COVID and replan everything.
[19:57.200 --> 19:59.220]  It may be necessary to do that.
[19:59.220 --> 20:02.120]  So don't think that things are going to go back
[20:02.120 --> 20:03.300]  to the way they were.
[20:03.300 --> 20:04.460]  We may get a vaccine.
[20:04.460 --> 20:06.180]  Some people will take it, some won't.
[20:06.180 --> 20:08.980]  Some are going to have fucking conspiracy theories about it.
[20:08.980 --> 20:11.060]  I'm not even going to tell you where I stand on that
[20:11.060 --> 20:12.660]  because I don't want the emails,
[20:12.660 --> 20:15.320]  but it's not going to be like it was.
[20:15.320 --> 20:16.460]  We will get the vaccine.
[20:16.460 --> 20:17.620]  Some people will get treated,
[20:17.620 --> 20:19.740]  but there's always going to be a weirdness
[20:19.740 --> 20:22.420]  that stemmed from this situation.
[20:22.420 --> 20:24.140]  The world will not be what it was.
[20:24.140 --> 20:25.260]  That's my opinion.
[20:25.260 --> 20:26.100]  I'm getting older.
[20:26.100 --> 20:27.740]  I feel like I've got some foresight.
[20:27.740 --> 20:29.660]  I've been watching, I've been paying attention,
[20:29.660 --> 20:31.940]  and I don't think things are ever going to be
[20:31.940 --> 20:33.000]  like they were before.
[20:33.560 --> 20:34.800]  When you are writing your goals,
[20:34.800 --> 20:35.840]  when you're setting your plans
[20:35.840 --> 20:38.480]  and your expectations for 2021,
[20:38.480 --> 20:41.800]  remember that 2019 shit is not the same.
[20:41.800 --> 20:43.760]  2021 is going to be way different
[20:43.760 --> 20:46.960]  because 2020 was fucking weird.
[20:46.960 --> 20:50.480]  So set yourself up for success in 2021.
[20:50.480 --> 20:51.320]  Let's make some goals.
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.480]  Let's make some plans.
[20:52.480 --> 20:53.680]  Do you have personal goals?
[20:53.680 --> 20:54.800]  Do you have financial goals?
[20:54.800 --> 20:56.160]  Do you have business goals?
[20:56.160 --> 20:57.160]  Do you have career goals?
[20:57.160 --> 20:58.520]  Do you have family goals?
[20:58.520 --> 21:01.000]  Are you helping somebody else reach their goals?
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.600]  Maybe you're a husband helping a wife start a new business.
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.400]  Maybe you're a wife helping a husband.
[21:07.400 --> 21:11.000]  Maybe you're a parent helping a child develop something new.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.300]  Maybe you and your best friend
[21:12.300 --> 21:13.840]  are going to start a new business.
[21:13.840 --> 21:15.760]  Be the best partner and supportive person
[21:15.760 --> 21:17.620]  you can be in 2021.
[21:17.620 --> 21:18.560]  Let's help each other out.
[21:18.560 --> 21:19.800]  Let's be prepared.
[21:19.800 --> 21:22.360]  Let's get our shit together and help everybody.
[21:22.360 --> 21:25.400]  I feel like I'm rambling, but we've got to have a plan.
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.620]  Do you have some financial goals?
[21:26.620 --> 21:28.200]  Do you have goals for what you're going to do?
[21:28.200 --> 21:30.120]  Do you have garden goals?
[21:30.120 --> 21:31.840]  How many crops are you going to turn
[21:31.840 --> 21:34.560]  in your grow room in 2021?
[21:34.560 --> 21:36.800]  If it takes you 60 days to run a crop in there,
[21:36.800 --> 21:37.640]  that's two months.
[21:37.640 --> 21:39.560]  You should get six crops out of that, right?
[21:39.560 --> 21:41.360]  It's going to take you a little longer than 60 days
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.960]  because most of our plants go 63, 65.
[21:43.960 --> 21:46.760]  You should get 5.7 crops out of that room, right?
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.240]  How are you going to make that happen?
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.160]  How are you going to veg and flower
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.520]  and then have more plants in veg to fill that flower
[21:52.520 --> 21:53.840]  as soon as it comes down?
[21:53.840 --> 21:57.720]  Let's make some grow room goals and schedules
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.840]  before the year starts.
[21:58.840 --> 22:00.280]  I got a week to work on this.
[22:00.280 --> 22:01.760]  It's going to kick in in seven days
[22:01.760 --> 22:03.000]  from the time you hear this.
[22:03.000 --> 22:04.920]  So let's start getting prepared now.
[22:04.920 --> 22:07.280]  Not only garden goals, what are you going to learn?
[22:07.280 --> 22:08.280]  Are you, what are you going to,
[22:08.280 --> 22:09.820]  what did you suck at this year?
[22:09.820 --> 22:11.160]  Were you not a good cloner?
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.840]  Were you not good at identifying males?
[22:12.840 --> 22:14.400]  Are you not good at scrogging?
[22:14.400 --> 22:16.320]  Are you not good at putting up a trellis?
[22:16.320 --> 22:19.360]  Let's get better at those things in 2021.
[22:19.360 --> 22:23.320]  So set yourself up for success, improve in 2021
[22:23.320 --> 22:25.760]  and have some sort of a plan and some sort of a goal.
[22:25.760 --> 22:27.560]  Without plans and goals, I've said this,
[22:27.560 --> 22:28.560]  we don't move forward.
[22:29.280 --> 22:30.600]  And if we do move forward, how do we even know?
[22:30.600 --> 22:32.640]  There's nothing to base it on, nothing to judge it on,
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.960]  nothing to guide it on.
[22:33.960 --> 22:37.200]  Set yourself up for success and have some sort of a goal.
[22:37.200 --> 22:39.080]  All right, you guys, I think I've covered
[22:39.080 --> 22:40.280]  all of the important notes.
[22:40.280 --> 22:42.520]  I do have some sad news that I saved here
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.080]  for the end of the podcast.
[22:45.360 --> 22:47.640]  I've been following a person for a really long time
[22:47.640 --> 22:48.800]  on social media.
[22:48.800 --> 22:50.240]  Before social media was a thing,
[22:50.240 --> 22:52.520]  this person was a huge member of the forums.
[22:52.520 --> 22:55.560]  This person has been a big and an important member
[22:55.560 --> 22:58.480]  of the cannabis community and has often been overlooked.
[22:59.280 --> 23:00.960]  But I wanna give a huge moment of silence
[23:00.960 --> 23:04.680]  and a moment of respect to a man known as Bog,
[23:04.680 --> 23:06.440]  the Bushy Old Grower.
[23:06.440 --> 23:09.040]  Unfortunately, damn, I'm gonna cry.
[23:09.040 --> 23:11.480]  Bushy Old Grower passed away recently, you guys.
[23:11.480 --> 23:14.080]  And Bushy Old Grower was a very inspiring grower.
[23:14.080 --> 23:16.200]  He's known as Bog Seeds, Bog Genetics.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.240]  If you've smoked boggle gum, that is from bog.
[23:19.240 --> 23:21.200]  A lot of the things that bog made
[23:21.200 --> 23:23.800]  were bred into the current strains now.
[23:23.800 --> 23:26.200]  So I'm gonna give a short moment of silence
[23:26.200 --> 23:27.560]  on a podcast here for Bog,
[23:27.560 --> 23:28.960]  and then I'll tell you what we're gonna do
[23:28.960 --> 23:30.760]  for Bog's family right after that.
[23:30.760 --> 23:33.000]  Here's a moment of silence for my friend Bog.
[23:37.120 --> 23:38.500]  Rest in peace, Bushy Old Grower.
[23:38.500 --> 23:39.500]  We'll never forget you.
[23:39.500 --> 23:42.040]  All right, now what we need to do as a community,
[23:42.040 --> 23:43.380]  sorry, that shook me up.
[23:43.380 --> 23:44.800]  What we need to do as a community,
[23:44.800 --> 23:46.840]  we need to help out Mrs. Bog.
[23:46.840 --> 23:48.780]  There were a lot of medical expenses left behind,
[23:48.780 --> 23:50.580]  there were funeral costs left behind,
[23:50.580 --> 23:51.800]  and Mrs. Bog is alone.
[23:51.800 --> 23:55.100]  So there is a GoFundMe page for Mrs. Bog.
[23:55.100 --> 23:57.360]  I will include that link in the show notes,
[23:57.360 --> 23:59.180]  the video description, so we could get that.
[23:59.180 --> 24:02.380]  Excuse me, I'm gonna cry for a second, but I'm okay.
[24:02.380 --> 24:06.460]  I didn't prepare that, so that was fucking real, you guys.
[24:06.460 --> 24:07.280]  That was what that was.
[24:07.280 --> 24:08.580]  So thank you for joining me for that.
[24:08.580 --> 24:10.260]  But there will be a link in the show
[24:10.260 --> 24:13.220]  so that we can get Mrs. Bog some funding and some support,
[24:13.220 --> 24:15.140]  because she's all alone now.
[24:15.140 --> 24:16.860]  Imagine being married to somebody for 50 years
[24:16.860 --> 24:17.940]  and they're gone.
[24:17.940 --> 24:19.420]  You're not gonna know what to do.
[24:19.420 --> 24:20.260]  So you're gonna need some help.
[24:20.260 --> 24:22.580]  So let's give Mrs. Bog some help.
[24:22.580 --> 24:24.520]  Damn, that was harder to do than I thought it would be,
[24:24.520 --> 24:25.660]  but that's real.
[24:25.660 --> 24:27.020]  Merry Christmas, you bad motherfuckers.
[24:27.020 --> 24:28.540]  Let's get out of that.
[24:28.900 --> 24:29.740]  I wanna wrap up this podcast.
[24:29.740 --> 24:31.900]  That's why I saved that for the end.
[24:31.900 --> 24:33.260]  Where are we gonna go from there?
[24:33.260 --> 24:34.980]  If you feel like this episode was educational,
[24:34.980 --> 24:36.020]  informative, or entertaining,
[24:36.020 --> 24:37.780]  and you'd like to make that financial contribution
[24:37.780 --> 24:39.740]  to the show, once again, all you have to do is visit
[24:39.740 --> 24:43.980]  www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[24:43.980 --> 24:45.980]  What I'm gonna say is if you wanna contribute this month,
[24:45.980 --> 24:50.940]  let's send that $7.10 or that $4.20 or that 100 bucks,
[24:50.940 --> 24:52.680]  let's send that to Mrs. Bog this month.
[24:52.680 --> 24:54.300]  I'm okay, I'm fine.
[24:54.300 --> 24:56.500]  Mrs. Bog needs a hug and some funding.
[24:56.500 --> 24:59.940]  So follow the GoFundMe in my video description
[24:59.940 --> 25:01.260]  and let's help her out.
[25:01.260 --> 25:03.020]  I'm sorry I'm crying, you guys.
[25:03.020 --> 25:05.180]  Talk about dead people on the show, it gets to me.
[25:05.180 --> 25:06.980]  Especially people that inspired us and shit.
[25:06.980 --> 25:08.060]  That's important.
[25:08.060 --> 25:09.420]  You would always see Bog at the events.
[25:09.420 --> 25:11.220]  He had a booth at every Cannabis Cup.
[25:11.220 --> 25:13.800]  He was there, the old guy with the ponytail.
[25:13.800 --> 25:15.540]  And sometimes he had a beard, sometimes he didn't.
[25:15.540 --> 25:16.380]  He had his wife with him.
[25:16.380 --> 25:18.580]  It was just Bog and Mrs. Bog at the booth.
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.420]  That's the guy we lost.
[25:19.420 --> 25:22.160]  So that was a big part of the community, a big part.
[25:22.160 --> 25:25.780]  He wasn't as outspoken and popular on social media
[25:25.780 --> 25:26.740]  because he was an older dude.
[25:26.740 --> 25:28.620]  That he was before social media.
[25:28.620 --> 25:29.740]  That wasn't his thing.
[25:29.740 --> 25:31.900]  But when he did go on there, he always had a smile,
[25:31.900 --> 25:34.780]  always had a good attitude, was always a good dude,
[25:34.780 --> 25:37.140]  and always encouraged us to breed with his gear
[25:37.140 --> 25:38.900]  and would tell you which plants to breed with.
[25:38.900 --> 25:40.660]  He'd be like, don't use that one, use that one.
[25:40.660 --> 25:41.620]  Was a really good dude.
[25:41.620 --> 25:44.340]  So shout out to Bog, shout out to Mrs. Bog.
[25:44.340 --> 25:46.020]  Sorry you're gone and let's do our best
[25:46.020 --> 25:48.140]  to support Mrs. Bog because being a widow
[25:48.140 --> 25:50.460]  has got to be one of the most challenging things ever.
[25:50.460 --> 25:52.920]  All right, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart
[25:52.920 --> 25:55.560]  or use that GoFundMe that I did put in the link
[25:56.340 --> 25:57.180]  to help out Mrs. Bog.
[25:57.180 --> 25:59.280]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments,
[25:59.280 --> 26:02.120]  concerns, words of encouragement, anything like that,
[26:02.120 --> 26:02.960]  I love hearing that.
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.200]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[26:06.200 --> 26:07.200]  Do not be shy.
[26:07.200 --> 26:08.440]  Send me anything you'd like to know.
[26:08.440 --> 26:09.840]  I'll answer your questions, I'll help you out,
[26:09.840 --> 26:10.860]  give you guidance.
[26:10.860 --> 26:12.360]  That's what I'm here for.
[26:12.360 --> 26:13.260]  Be patient though.
[26:13.260 --> 26:15.920]  There's just one of me and there are thousands of you.
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.080]  I'm backed up on messages, but I do about twice a week,
[26:19.080 --> 26:21.640]  I take a fat dab and I just sit in front of the computer
[26:21.640 --> 26:23.400]  and I try to answer as many as I can
[26:23.400 --> 26:26.480]  until my ADD kicks in, honestly.
[26:26.480 --> 26:29.000]  Answering emails is one of the most boring things
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.040]  for my brain to do, but I have to focus in and do it.
[26:31.040 --> 26:32.760]  I try, you guys, I really try.
[26:32.760 --> 26:34.800]  But then I find myself, I just get up and walk away
[26:34.800 --> 26:36.160]  and I'm in the garden suddenly and I'm like,
[26:36.160 --> 26:37.920]  oh, I was answering emails.
[26:37.920 --> 26:41.400]  ADD, ADD, you just saw ADD in full effect.
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.400]  Also, don't forget to visit my website, iregenetics.com.
[26:44.400 --> 26:46.360]  All things Rasta Jeff, iRegenetics,
[26:46.360 --> 26:47.960]  grow from your heart will be there.
[26:47.960 --> 26:51.280]  iRegenetics.com, check it out.
[26:51.280 --> 26:53.920]  All right, you guys, that was my quick Christmas episode.
[26:53.920 --> 26:55.560]  I feel like I covered a lot of ground.
[26:55.560 --> 26:58.000]  We went from smiles to cries, right back to smiles.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.320]  Thank you for joining me for that.
[26:59.320 --> 27:00.760]  I'm not gonna edit any of this show.
[27:00.760 --> 27:02.480]  This is going out just like it is.
[27:02.480 --> 27:03.760]  I'm gonna go put it in the new Macbook
[27:03.760 --> 27:06.720]  and earn the new Mac and see what Garage
[27:06.720 --> 27:09.480]  or iMovie does to it, see how long it takes me to post it.
[27:09.480 --> 27:11.520]  Then I'm gonna hopefully get some more podcasts
[27:11.520 --> 27:12.800]  done on that machine.
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.600]  I'm rambling, but this was a great show.
[27:14.600 --> 27:15.800]  It's time for me to take some dabs
[27:15.800 --> 27:18.800]  and it's time for you to get back to your family.
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.180]  If you're not hanging out with some family,
[27:20.220 --> 27:22.060]  jump on a Zoom video, hang out with some friends.
[27:22.060 --> 27:23.540]  I'm sure that Eagle is on right now.
[27:23.540 --> 27:25.060]  You could go watch Eagle.
[27:25.060 --> 27:25.900]  He never signs out.
[27:25.900 --> 27:27.580]  If Eagle's not on, Fumidor is on.
[27:27.580 --> 27:29.420]  Somebody is on Zoom on YouTube right now.
[27:29.420 --> 27:30.260]  You can watch them.
[27:30.260 --> 27:31.080]  Join us.
[27:31.080 --> 27:32.720]  I may be in somebody's chat right now hanging out
[27:32.720 --> 27:33.560]  just as well.
[27:33.560 --> 27:35.340]  Late at night, I jump in those chats and I hang out.
[27:35.340 --> 27:37.060]  It is such a good time.
[27:37.060 --> 27:38.020]  All right, it's time for me to go
[27:38.020 --> 27:40.100]  because I'm obviously rambling and need a dab.
[27:40.100 --> 27:42.900]  I wanna send a big shout out to my friend, Bogg.
[27:42.900 --> 27:45.460]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[27:45.460 --> 27:47.020]  and give your mom a hug for me.
