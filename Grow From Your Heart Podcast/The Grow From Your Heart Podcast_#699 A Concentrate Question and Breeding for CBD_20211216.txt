[00:19.900 --> 00:21.340]  All right, here we go.
[00:21.340 --> 00:23.100]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:23.100 --> 00:25.180]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff,
[00:25.180 --> 00:30.180]  and this is episode 699 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.900]  In this episode, I'm going to focus
[00:32.900 --> 00:34.700]  on a couple of grow questions.
[00:34.700 --> 00:36.500]  Before I get to that part of the show,
[00:36.500 --> 00:39.240]  let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks
[00:39.240 --> 00:42.780]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.980]  Let's kick it off with a big
[00:43.980 --> 00:46.300]  Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[00:46.300 --> 00:49.000]  to a long time supporter, our friend Brian P.

[01:14.780 --> 01:15.840]  Then let's wrap it all up
[01:15.840 --> 01:17.680]  with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:17.680 --> 01:20.640]  Thank you, shout out to our friend, Ruh-roh.
[01:20.640 --> 01:22.920]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[01:22.920 --> 01:25.440]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:25.440 --> 01:27.280]  If you are not already supporting the show
[01:27.280 --> 01:29.100]  and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:29.100 --> 01:33.760]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:33.760 --> 01:35.600]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:35.600 --> 01:36.880]  All of the information you need
[01:36.880 --> 01:38.440]  will be right there on the screen.
[01:38.440 --> 01:41.100]  And you know, I do include that link in the show notes
[01:41.100 --> 01:43.960]  and in the video description to make it nice and easy
[01:43.960 --> 01:46.900]  for all of my friends.
[01:46.900 --> 01:49.180]  Speaking of making things easy for all of my friends,
[01:49.180 --> 01:51.500]  I got a very weird Patreon message.
[01:51.500 --> 01:52.580]  I'm not gonna say who it was,
[01:52.580 --> 01:54.000]  I'm not gonna say their name.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.900]  I got a question about,
[01:55.900 --> 01:58.980]  I was straight up relationship, love and relationship
[01:58.980 --> 02:00.900]  and family and marriage advice.
[02:00.900 --> 02:03.480]  And I'm gonna say right now at the top of this show,
[02:03.480 --> 02:04.800]  that's not what this is about.
[02:04.800 --> 02:08.340]  I am in no way qualified to give you relationship advice,
[02:08.340 --> 02:09.220]  that sort of stuff.
[02:09.220 --> 02:11.100]  This is a cannabis growing show.
[02:11.100 --> 02:12.840]  Somebody paid money on my Patreon
[02:12.840 --> 02:15.560]  to ask me a relationship advice question.
[02:15.560 --> 02:16.960]  I asked if they wanted their money back.
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.000]  They did not want their contribution back.
[02:19.000 --> 02:20.920]  I felt it very weird.
[02:20.920 --> 02:22.480]  I'm not the guy to come to for that.
[02:22.480 --> 02:24.320]  So that was awkward.
[02:24.320 --> 02:26.000]  That's all I really got to say about that.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.200]  I wanted to address that on the show
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.760]  because first of all, it was kind of,
[02:28.760 --> 02:30.440]  I thought they might be trolling me,
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.360]  but then I realized, no, this person paid money for this.
[02:33.360 --> 02:34.360]  They might be serious.
[02:34.360 --> 02:35.200]  So I contacted them.
[02:35.200 --> 02:36.280]  I was like, bro, is this for real?
[02:36.280 --> 02:37.360]  And they're like, yeah, I need your guidance.
[02:37.360 --> 02:38.680]  And I was like, I'm not the person, dude.
[02:38.680 --> 02:40.340]  I'm not a relationship counselor.
[02:40.340 --> 02:43.280]  All I'm gonna do is, I'm a 42 year old single guy.
[02:43.280 --> 02:46.480]  Not the guy to ask for relationship advice from.
[02:46.480 --> 02:47.520]  I just wanna make it clear.
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.960]  Don't send me relationship questions on Patreon.
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.280]  You'll get your money back.
[02:51.280 --> 02:52.320]  And also that's kind of funny.
[02:52.320 --> 02:53.240]  I thought it was funny.
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.000]  Once I was like, this is real.
[02:55.000 --> 02:56.560]  I don't know if I thought it was funnier
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.580]  when I thought it was trolling
[02:57.580 --> 02:59.160]  or when I realized it was real.
[02:59.160 --> 03:01.100]  Either way, that was my laugh of the week.
[03:01.100 --> 03:02.900]  I thought I'd share it with you guys.
[03:02.900 --> 03:04.840]  Relationship advice on Patreon.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.680]  That's kind of funny.
[03:05.680 --> 03:06.600]  Maybe I should have taken the money
[03:06.600 --> 03:08.040]  and given my best advice.
[03:08.040 --> 03:09.600]  It did not feel right.
[03:09.600 --> 03:11.520]  I don't have that kind of qualification, you guys.
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.440]  All right, let's jump into some real content
[03:13.440 --> 03:15.120]  here on this podcast.
[03:15.120 --> 03:17.020]  I do have a Patreon question here in front of me
[03:17.020 --> 03:19.560]  that does come from a long time Patreon supporter
[03:19.560 --> 03:22.280]  who would rather remain anonymous.
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.440]  It goes a lot like this.
[03:23.440 --> 03:24.920]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
[03:24.920 --> 03:26.360]  I've never heard you discuss
[03:26.360 --> 03:29.320]  the washing qualities of your strains.
[03:29.320 --> 03:32.080]  I plan on dabbling in some bubble hash production.
[03:32.080 --> 03:34.040]  And I've wondered if you have any reports
[03:34.040 --> 03:36.320]  on iry washing attributes.
[03:36.320 --> 03:38.040]  If no such reports exist,
[03:38.040 --> 03:40.840]  which iry strain is the stickiest of them all?
[03:40.840 --> 03:42.440]  That's a very good question.
[03:42.440 --> 03:43.760]  What our friend here is asking
[03:43.760 --> 03:45.120]  is about making bubble hash.
[03:45.120 --> 03:47.720]  They're going to, there's a lot of good ways to do this,
[03:47.720 --> 03:49.240]  but let's just stick to the point.
[03:49.240 --> 03:50.340]  They're going to make some bubble hash.
[03:50.340 --> 03:53.040]  They're going to extract the trichomes
[03:53.040 --> 03:55.520]  from the plants using ice water,
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.600]  ice, probably some bubble bags,
[03:57.600 --> 03:58.500]  and some agitation.
[03:58.500 --> 03:59.880]  That's the main way to do it.
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.040]  They're gonna freeze the trichomes off the buds,
[04:02.040 --> 04:03.960]  collect them through some sort of a sieve bag.
[04:03.960 --> 04:05.600]  That's the way it's gonna happen here.
[04:05.600 --> 04:07.040]  So our friend is basically asking
[04:07.040 --> 04:09.680]  which iry genetic strains wash the best
[04:09.680 --> 04:12.240]  because they do plan to make some bubble hash.
[04:12.240 --> 04:14.320]  They are going to use bubble bags
[04:14.320 --> 04:16.600]  and ice and water and agitation
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.080]  and remove the trichomes from the plant material
[04:19.080 --> 04:20.880]  to make smokable concentrate.
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.040]  Some people from there will press that,
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.760]  make it even cleaner and better.
[04:24.760 --> 04:26.280]  Some people will just smoke the bubble
[04:26.280 --> 04:28.140]  depending on the quality that they make.
[04:28.140 --> 04:29.800]  There are a lot of methods to doing that.
[04:29.800 --> 04:32.220]  In the wintertime, it's a great time to make bubble hash
[04:32.220 --> 04:34.240]  because the colder your environment,
[04:34.240 --> 04:36.760]  the colder the process, the better the concentrate.
[04:36.760 --> 04:38.640]  That is an advantage of being here in Colorado
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.960]  in the wintertime.
[04:39.960 --> 04:41.520]  Let me get myself back on track.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.200]  Our friend wants to make bubble hash
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.280]  and to make the best hash,
[04:44.280 --> 04:46.640]  they wanna know which iry genetic strains
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.960]  have been known for making the best bubble
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.700]  and the best wash concentrates.
[04:51.700 --> 04:53.460]  I do have some good feedback for you.
[04:53.460 --> 04:55.500]  I can tell you right away that the cream
[04:55.500 --> 04:58.640]  is definitely going to be one of the best washers.
[04:58.640 --> 05:00.680]  The cream is amazing for washing.
[05:00.680 --> 05:02.120]  It rinses really easily.
[05:02.120 --> 05:03.960]  It puts off a lot of product.
[05:03.960 --> 05:05.880]  It tastes and smells amazing.
[05:05.880 --> 05:08.200]  And most of the time, the color that comes from it
[05:08.800 --> 05:09.960]  is a real light white color.
[05:09.960 --> 05:13.760]  So it makes your washed product look really desirable,
[05:13.760 --> 05:16.280]  really tasty, and the buzz from it
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.480]  will sit you on your ass.
[05:17.480 --> 05:19.020]  It's the kind of buzz that makes you just,
[05:19.020 --> 05:20.400]  sometimes when you smoke concentrates,
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.440]  your brain will wander.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.640]  When you smoke the cream,
[05:22.640 --> 05:24.120]  you just sit right back in your ass.
[05:24.120 --> 05:26.000]  You find a recliner and you lean back
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.420]  and you chill out for a little bit.
[05:27.420 --> 05:28.320]  That's what it'll do to you.
[05:28.320 --> 05:31.860]  So the cream is going to be my very first recommendation.
[05:31.860 --> 05:33.880]  However, the cream is getting close
[05:33.880 --> 05:37.080]  to being sold out forever.
[05:37.080 --> 05:40.560]  Once the cream sells out, I'm not going to make any more.
[05:40.560 --> 05:42.360]  Nothing against the cream plant.
[05:42.360 --> 05:44.680]  Excuse me, nothing against that cream plant.
[05:44.680 --> 05:46.160]  It is just, it's not something
[05:46.160 --> 05:48.080]  that I'm going to work with anymore.
[05:48.080 --> 05:49.200]  It's time to move on.
[05:49.200 --> 05:50.480]  I make some things.
[05:50.480 --> 05:53.040]  I produce them for a certain amount of time.
[05:53.040 --> 05:55.040]  And then sometimes I just simply move on.
[05:55.040 --> 05:56.860]  I'm only allowed to have so many plants in the garden.
[05:56.860 --> 05:57.700]  You guys know that.
[05:57.700 --> 06:00.400]  And so the cream, the mom plant that makes the cream
[06:00.400 --> 06:01.240]  has been eliminated.
[06:01.240 --> 06:02.760]  I don't have that plant anymore.
[06:02.760 --> 06:04.320]  Couldn't make more if I wanted to.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.320]  I could F2 it.
[06:05.320 --> 06:06.400]  I could S1 it.
[06:06.400 --> 06:07.720]  However, it is time to move on.
[06:07.720 --> 06:09.600]  The cream has done its thing.
[06:09.600 --> 06:10.680]  It's worked its course.
[06:10.680 --> 06:12.560]  So I will not be making any more cream seeds.
[06:12.560 --> 06:14.740]  If you can find them, if you can get them,
[06:14.740 --> 06:18.040]  I would get those, make some bubble hash with those.
[06:18.040 --> 06:20.160]  Another line that would make amazing concentrates
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.620]  is the dark hollow.
[06:21.620 --> 06:24.400]  That one makes more of that real musky, earthy,
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.960]  garlicky scented concentrate.
[06:25.960 --> 06:27.660]  It's also real light in color.
[06:27.660 --> 06:28.800]  It washes really well.
[06:28.800 --> 06:31.360]  I really like the dark hollow concentrates.
[06:31.360 --> 06:33.180]  Now let's talk about something else.
[06:33.180 --> 06:35.140]  I was at the Dude Grows Cup
[06:35.140 --> 06:38.180]  and my friend Kelvin grew Strawberry Starburst
[06:38.180 --> 06:41.860]  and they pressed the Strawberry Starburst into rosin.
[06:41.860 --> 06:45.280]  The rosin that Pedro made out of the Strawberry Starburst
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.460]  was some of my favorite rosin I have ever smoked.
[06:48.460 --> 06:49.900]  So if you're going to press it,
[06:49.900 --> 06:53.000]  maybe Strawberry Starburst might be right up your alley
[06:53.000 --> 06:54.820]  for the pressing concentrates.
[06:54.820 --> 06:58.140]  I also wrote down that the Blue Raspberry Truffle
[06:58.140 --> 07:01.360]  has made some amazing pressed concentrates.
[07:01.360 --> 07:03.700]  Then we're going to talk about the machine.
[07:03.700 --> 07:07.460]  Recently I was gifted a batch of the machine.
[07:07.460 --> 07:10.580]  So the machine started off as machine fresh frozen buds.
[07:10.580 --> 07:12.400]  They grew the plant, they chopped it down,
[07:12.400 --> 07:13.600]  they took off all the big leaves
[07:13.600 --> 07:15.660]  and froze it almost immediately.
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.500]  Then they took that and they made bubble hash
[07:17.500 --> 07:19.280]  out of those frozen buds.
[07:19.280 --> 07:20.980]  From those frozen buds,
[07:20.980 --> 07:24.160]  then they pressed that in a press and made hash rosin.
[07:24.160 --> 07:26.840]  That concentrate put me on my ass.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.820]  It made me totally goofy.
[07:28.820 --> 07:31.780]  The entire time I had that jar of concentrates around,
[07:31.780 --> 07:33.180]  my day was just half done.
[07:33.620 --> 07:34.900]  It was like I was multitasking,
[07:34.900 --> 07:37.780]  but I was actually multifucking things up.
[07:37.780 --> 07:39.820]  I wasn't getting anything done properly.
[07:39.820 --> 07:41.120]  I was doing 10 things at a time.
[07:41.120 --> 07:42.820]  All of them were failing.
[07:42.820 --> 07:43.700]  It was a good thing.
[07:43.700 --> 07:46.820]  That concentrate was awesome, but it made me stupid.
[07:46.820 --> 07:47.700]  It made me dumb.
[07:47.700 --> 07:51.760]  I did a podcast and I don't recall that podcast.
[07:51.760 --> 07:52.600]  I know I did it.
[07:52.600 --> 07:53.440]  I know I had a good time.
[07:53.440 --> 07:54.860]  I know it was a good show,
[07:54.860 --> 07:56.420]  but I was in a bubble for the whole time.
[07:56.420 --> 07:58.380]  That machine concentrate wrecked me.
[07:58.380 --> 08:00.780]  So the machine makes great concentrates.
[08:00.780 --> 08:01.940]  Something else I've noticed
[08:02.020 --> 08:04.180]  is that all of the lemon strains that I breed
[08:04.180 --> 08:06.060]  make really tall trichomes,
[08:06.060 --> 08:10.020]  and those tall trichomes seem to make good concentrates.
[08:10.020 --> 08:12.640]  So the Lemon Sunrise, the Lemon Jeffrey,
[08:12.640 --> 08:14.840]  those seem to make really good concentrates.
[08:14.840 --> 08:16.340]  I don't know if it's the tall trichomes.
[08:16.340 --> 08:18.340]  I don't know if it's the size of the trichome head.
[08:18.340 --> 08:19.260]  I'm really not certain.
[08:19.260 --> 08:22.440]  I'm not a concentrate maker or a trichome head expert,
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.120]  so that is not my area of expertise,
[08:24.120 --> 08:26.280]  but I do know that those lemon strains
[08:26.280 --> 08:28.620]  make amazing concentrates.
[08:28.620 --> 08:31.180]  Now I did say that I'm not the concentrate maker.
[08:31.180 --> 08:32.820]  Let me tease an upcoming episode.
[08:32.820 --> 08:34.300]  For episode 710,
[08:34.300 --> 08:37.540]  I do plan to have a concentrate maker on the show.
[08:37.540 --> 08:39.460]  I will ask them about the size and shape
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.220]  of trichome stalks and heads
[08:41.220 --> 08:43.160]  and see how much of a difference that does make
[08:43.160 --> 08:44.900]  in our concentrate production,
[08:44.900 --> 08:47.460]  because I'm interested to learn that type of thing too.
[08:47.460 --> 08:48.700]  So I've been rambling for quite a bit
[08:48.700 --> 08:50.900]  about bubble hash recommendations.
[08:50.900 --> 08:52.500]  Let me kind of recap a little bit.
[08:52.500 --> 08:55.700]  And then also, let me, you should keep this in mind.
[08:55.700 --> 08:57.220]  I do smoke a lot of flour.
[08:57.220 --> 08:58.940]  People are like, do you only smoke concentrates?
[08:58.940 --> 09:00.700]  No, I smoke a lot of flour.
[09:01.220 --> 09:03.180]  I just tend to take more dabs when I'm on the go,
[09:03.180 --> 09:06.660]  because to get myself the buzz I want with flours,
[09:06.660 --> 09:09.700]  I basically have to smoke an entire big fat joint,
[09:09.700 --> 09:11.900]  about a two gram, three and a half gram joint.
[09:11.900 --> 09:13.500]  I gotta smoke that bad bitch by myself
[09:13.500 --> 09:15.380]  to get the desired effect.
[09:15.380 --> 09:16.720]  And then I'm just carrying a joint around
[09:16.720 --> 09:18.020]  or hitting a bowl all day.
[09:18.020 --> 09:20.900]  I could take a dab or two dabs in just a couple of minutes
[09:20.900 --> 09:23.300]  and be lit for a few hours,
[09:23.300 --> 09:24.760]  a couple, maybe two and a half hours.
[09:24.760 --> 09:26.440]  If I take a couple of fat dabs,
[09:26.440 --> 09:27.900]  I could be nice and heavily medicated.
[09:27.900 --> 09:29.420]  I would prefer a dab every hour,
[09:29.420 --> 09:31.340]  but when you're working, when you're busy,
[09:31.340 --> 09:32.260]  trying to be productive,
[09:32.260 --> 09:34.120]  you can't be sitting around dabbing all day.
[09:34.120 --> 09:35.260]  So I try to stay on the move.
[09:35.260 --> 09:36.500]  That's why I smoke a lot of dabs,
[09:36.500 --> 09:39.580]  but I do love smoking a lot of flours.
[09:39.580 --> 09:40.420]  I breed seeds.
[09:40.420 --> 09:42.660]  I make a lot of new creations.
[09:42.660 --> 09:44.480]  I like to test grow and test smoke
[09:44.480 --> 09:46.220]  and enjoy my new creations.
[09:46.220 --> 09:49.620]  I really love to smoke when I create a new seed line
[09:49.620 --> 09:51.740]  and give it to somebody local and they grow it
[09:51.740 --> 09:54.300]  and they bring me flours or bring me concentrates.
[09:54.300 --> 09:55.740]  I love smoking those flours.
[09:55.740 --> 09:57.220]  I love smoking those concentrates.
[09:57.220 --> 09:59.360]  So I do smoke a lot of flours,
[10:00.300 --> 10:02.120]  but I primarily have been smoking concentrates lately
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.040]  since the whole dab revolution fired up
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.160]  and they're easily available, readily available.
[10:07.160 --> 10:08.680]  Kind of what I'm leaning towards here,
[10:08.680 --> 10:10.260]  kind of what I'm heading for is,
[10:10.260 --> 10:14.000]  I think I've accidentally been breeding flours
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.740]  that are geared toward concentrate production.
[10:16.740 --> 10:19.680]  I don't know if I was doing it subconsciously or consciously
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.000]  but I prefer to smoke concentrates.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.160]  So when my harvest is ready, when all my flours are done,
[10:25.160 --> 10:27.200]  most of the time, if it's not a seeded product,
[10:27.200 --> 10:29.020]  if it's something I grew for myself,
[10:29.680 --> 10:30.980]  at least two thirds, three quarters of it
[10:30.980 --> 10:33.020]  gets allocated for concentrate production.
[10:33.020 --> 10:34.580]  We don't even trim it,
[10:34.580 --> 10:37.300]  not the way that we would trim it for smoking,
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.420]  which we'll talk about our concentrate gurus
[10:39.420 --> 10:40.900]  in a future episode to see the difference
[10:40.900 --> 10:43.100]  between harvesting and growing our buds,
[10:43.100 --> 10:45.780]  if there's a difference between growing for concentrate
[10:45.780 --> 10:46.700]  and growing for flours.
[10:46.700 --> 10:50.060]  But I allocate probably three quarters of my grow
[10:50.060 --> 10:53.100]  for concentrate making, concentrate production,
[10:53.100 --> 10:54.940]  because I prefer to smoke concentrates.
[10:54.940 --> 10:57.200]  So I maybe subconsciously, secretly,
[10:57.200 --> 10:58.840]  in the back of my head have been breeding
[10:59.660 --> 11:01.240]  so that I can have the best quality concentrates.
[11:01.240 --> 11:03.600]  If you think about it, I've got strawberry Starburst,
[11:03.600 --> 11:05.280]  that makes fucking strawberry concentrates.
[11:05.280 --> 11:07.520]  Who doesn't love a strawberry concentrate?
[11:07.520 --> 11:09.560]  Lemon Jeffrey, lemon concentrates.
[11:09.560 --> 11:11.800]  Who doesn't love a lemon concentrate?
[11:11.800 --> 11:13.740]  I kind of caught myself accidentally breeding
[11:13.740 --> 11:14.960]  toward that avenue.
[11:14.960 --> 11:17.720]  Most of my stuff is going toward the most flavorable,
[11:17.720 --> 11:19.560]  most potent concentrates.
[11:19.560 --> 11:20.800]  So I said I was gonna recap.
[11:20.800 --> 11:22.640]  I don't know if I got to that part.
[11:22.640 --> 11:25.320]  Bubble hash, some of the best strains I would recommend
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.280]  would be the cream.
[11:26.280 --> 11:28.520]  I've got great experience with the cream making,
[11:29.200 --> 11:30.720]  amazing bubble hash.
[11:30.720 --> 11:32.680]  Then I would say strawberry Starburst.
[11:32.680 --> 11:34.640]  Then I would say blue raspberry truffle.
[11:34.640 --> 11:36.360]  Then I would throw the machine in there,
[11:36.360 --> 11:38.640]  definitely dark hollow.
[11:38.640 --> 11:41.360]  Then all of the lemon strains that I make
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.120]  fall in that category for making good concentrates.
[11:44.120 --> 11:45.340]  I don't have good experience.
[11:45.340 --> 11:46.440]  I don't have the education,
[11:46.440 --> 11:49.440]  but I think something with the size of the trichome heads,
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.920]  they come from the lemon skunk plant that I work with.
[11:51.920 --> 11:54.560]  I think that results in very good concentrates.
[11:54.560 --> 11:56.520]  It just catches in the bags very well.
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.040]  And I guess if there's a big trichome head,
[11:58.560 --> 11:59.400]  there's gotta be a lot of product
[11:59.400 --> 12:01.080]  inside of that trichome head as well, right?
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.880]  That's where all the magic happens.
[12:02.880 --> 12:04.280]  I'm not sure what I'm talking about.
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.200]  All right, my friend who would rather remain a non-a-mouse,
[12:07.200 --> 12:08.800]  I wanna thank you for your great message.
[12:08.800 --> 12:10.040]  I also want to thank you
[12:10.040 --> 12:12.040]  for the generous Patreon contribution
[12:12.040 --> 12:13.680]  that does not go unnoticed.
[12:13.680 --> 12:14.960]  Thank you for that.
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.200]  Look forward to hearing more from you.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.640]  If you have any more questions, please do reach out.
[12:18.640 --> 12:20.840]  He wrapped this up with, take care, bro.
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.520]  Oh, also, which is the stickiest iRestrain of all?
[12:24.520 --> 12:27.000]  I think sticky is going to be
[12:27.040 --> 12:29.760]  kind of more about your growing and breeding environment.
[12:29.760 --> 12:31.680]  It's all about, if your room is dry,
[12:31.680 --> 12:33.200]  your weed won't get real sticky.
[12:33.200 --> 12:34.320]  If your room is kind of humid,
[12:34.320 --> 12:37.200]  if you've got the proper VPD, your weed will get sticky.
[12:37.200 --> 12:39.880]  It's got the potential, the opportunity to get sticky.
[12:39.880 --> 12:42.280]  Then in the dry and cure process,
[12:42.280 --> 12:44.800]  you've gotta baby that weed and keep it just right,
[12:44.800 --> 12:47.520]  spongy, gooey, but not juicy.
[12:47.520 --> 12:50.360]  You want it kind of, that's the fine line right there.
[12:50.360 --> 12:51.960]  That's where you get the stickiness.
[12:51.960 --> 12:54.000]  I think that comes from the dry and cure.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.800]  I think anything out of my line,
[12:55.800 --> 12:57.960]  properly grown, properly dried and cured
[12:57.960 --> 13:01.280]  has the potential to be the sticky icky.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.120]  All right, dude, once again,
[13:02.120 --> 13:03.480]  thank you for the great question.
[13:03.480 --> 13:05.240]  Let's keep it moving.
[13:05.240 --> 13:07.360]  All right, this next message comes from our friends
[13:07.360 --> 13:11.560]  at Cedar City, Canada, and it goes a little bit like this.
[13:11.560 --> 13:13.160]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff,
[13:13.160 --> 13:15.880]  thank you for all the knowledge and info you drop.
[13:15.880 --> 13:16.780]  You are very welcome.
[13:16.780 --> 13:19.200]  Thank you for listening and watching.
[13:19.200 --> 13:22.080]  It goes on, it says, I'm cultivating indoor hemp
[13:22.080 --> 13:24.720]  because I live in a prohibition state.
[13:24.720 --> 13:28.760]  Be careful, you still may need hemp cultivation licenses.
[13:28.760 --> 13:31.560]  Don't think that just because it's hemp and not cannabis
[13:31.560 --> 13:33.360]  that you can't get in any trouble.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.560]  Side rant, random story.
[13:34.560 --> 13:37.920]  Sometimes these are people's favorite parts of the podcast.
[13:37.920 --> 13:40.600]  We had some friends who were growing cannabis outdoors.
[13:40.600 --> 13:43.040]  They possibly, allegedly, may have been over
[13:43.040 --> 13:44.960]  their legal limit of how many cannabis plants
[13:44.960 --> 13:46.880]  we were allowed to have in the region
[13:46.880 --> 13:47.800]  in which they were growing.
[13:47.800 --> 13:49.000]  The police came.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.040]  Actually, zoning came.
[13:51.040 --> 13:51.980]  It was zoning.
[13:51.980 --> 13:53.880]  It wasn't even the police because in Colorado,
[13:53.880 --> 13:56.120]  if you've got a certain amount of plants over your limit
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.160]  and you don't seem like you're into a criminal activity
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.480]  or a criminal enterprise, they just send zoning.
[14:00.480 --> 14:02.120]  So far, it's a zoning violation.
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.720]  So they sent code enforcement,
[14:03.720 --> 14:05.720]  and code enforcement comes up, and they're like,
[14:05.720 --> 14:08.680]  sir, it seems that you have too many cannabis plants.
[14:08.680 --> 14:11.200]  And my friend said, what if I tell you they're hemp plants?
[14:11.200 --> 14:12.360]  And he said, well, then we're gonna go get
[14:12.360 --> 14:14.080]  the Department of Agriculture and fine you
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.360]  for your illegal hemp plants,
[14:15.360 --> 14:17.240]  but if you've got illegal cannabis plants,
[14:17.240 --> 14:18.520]  we're just gonna make you cut those down
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.900]  until you've got your limit.
[14:19.900 --> 14:22.640]  So the options were, if they were cannabis plants,
[14:22.640 --> 14:24.480]  we were going to cut them down
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.000]  until we got to our legal limit.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.680]  We were allowed to have X plants.
[14:27.680 --> 14:29.800]  We had X plus question mark,
[14:29.800 --> 14:31.320]  had to cut down all the question mark,
[14:31.320 --> 14:34.000]  get to X while the Department,
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.400]  while the code enforcement guy watched,
[14:35.400 --> 14:37.560]  he basically was like, pick them out, cut them down.
[14:37.560 --> 14:38.400]  That's all I care about.
[14:38.400 --> 14:40.040]  And so the plants got chopped down.
[14:40.040 --> 14:42.280]  If they were hemp, we would not have had,
[14:42.280 --> 14:43.920]  they would not have had the option
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.820]  to cut down the parts, the plants, and the question mark.
[14:46.820 --> 14:48.920]  Those would have been illegal hemp plants,
[14:48.920 --> 14:51.000]  and we would have been fined for growing hemp
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.600]  without any licensing.
[14:53.440 --> 14:56.040]  That was a weird dynamic to experience that day.
[14:56.040 --> 14:58.200]  That luckily that zoning guy was pretty cool.
[14:58.200 --> 14:59.080]  He was just an older guy.
[14:59.080 --> 15:00.960]  He didn't want any shit, didn't want any trouble,
[15:00.960 --> 15:01.800]  wanted to come out and say,
[15:01.800 --> 15:03.320]  hey, the neighbors say it smells
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.860]  like fucking dank weed out here.
[15:04.860 --> 15:06.120]  You got too many plants.
[15:06.120 --> 15:08.240]  I can't really say much other than cut down the plants.
[15:08.240 --> 15:09.740]  And if those are still here in a few days,
[15:09.740 --> 15:10.960]  the law will come.
[15:10.960 --> 15:12.560]  And we're like, well, shit, we'll just cut down the plants.
[15:12.560 --> 15:13.920]  And the plants went choppity chop chop
[15:13.920 --> 15:15.280]  into the compost bin.
[15:15.280 --> 15:16.380]  That was that.
[15:16.380 --> 15:17.500]  We were allowed to finish the crop
[15:17.500 --> 15:20.240]  with the legal amount of plants in that area.
[15:20.240 --> 15:21.680]  I told you I was gonna get rambling.
[15:21.680 --> 15:23.360]  So be careful with your hemp plants.
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.220]  That is the main point of that story.
[15:26.280 --> 15:27.120]  Let's get back into this.
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.640]  I live in a prohibition state and I'm on the,
[15:29.640 --> 15:32.040]  be careful growing anything in a prohibition state,
[15:32.040 --> 15:33.360]  my friend, please do.
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.040]  It says, I'm on the fence with breeding a CBD cultivar.
[15:37.040 --> 15:38.360]  I like that.
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.120]  With your breeding expertise,
[15:41.120 --> 15:43.600]  that might be an exaggeration, but I appreciate that.
[15:43.600 --> 15:45.640]  Would it matter for THC sake,
[15:45.640 --> 15:49.320]  which was the male versus which was the female?
[15:49.320 --> 15:50.600]  Say an orange chasm.
[15:50.600 --> 15:52.960]  Let's not say orange chasm because orange chasm's a
[15:52.960 --> 15:54.600]  fem seed and it's got to be,
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.960]  this will, it may work in here,
[15:55.960 --> 15:58.040]  but I just wanna keep in mind orange chasm is fem
[15:58.040 --> 15:59.720]  and that bell went off in the breeder
[15:59.720 --> 16:01.080]  salesman side of my brain.
[16:01.080 --> 16:04.040]  Say orange chasm pollinated by CBD cultivar.
[16:04.040 --> 16:04.860]  That is possible.
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.600]  So you've got a female orange chasm
[16:06.600 --> 16:09.040]  pollinated by a high CBD cultivar
[16:09.040 --> 16:12.280]  or a pollen from a reversal,
[16:12.280 --> 16:16.200]  reversal or a male THC to the CBD cultivar.
[16:16.200 --> 16:17.040]  I see what you're saying.
[16:17.040 --> 16:19.900]  THC male to a CBD female or the opposite.
[16:19.900 --> 16:22.740]  Either way, I know you do not grow hemp,
[16:22.740 --> 16:24.620]  but if you had any advice or knowledge
[16:24.620 --> 16:26.780]  on the pollen donor versus the receiver,
[16:26.780 --> 16:27.820]  that'd be helpful.
[16:27.820 --> 16:29.460]  Thanks again.
[16:29.460 --> 16:30.460]  Didn't something cut out here.
[16:30.460 --> 16:31.620]  It looks like my printer.
[16:31.620 --> 16:33.380]  By the way, something is,
[16:33.380 --> 16:35.200]  oh, I think it says orange chasm is fire.
[16:35.200 --> 16:36.580]  The emojis did not print here.
[16:36.580 --> 16:37.700]  That's what happened.
[16:37.700 --> 16:39.260]  By the way, the orange chasm is fire.
[16:39.260 --> 16:40.100]  Thank you, bro.
[16:40.100 --> 16:41.220]  I appreciate that.
[16:41.220 --> 16:44.580]  Let's talk a little bit about breeding for cannabinoids.
[16:44.580 --> 16:48.220]  You're trying to create a high CBD cultivar by,
[16:48.220 --> 16:51.820]  yeah, high CBD cultivar by starting with a THC
[16:51.820 --> 16:54.380]  and a CBD high strain.
[16:54.380 --> 16:56.680]  So when you do the first cross,
[16:56.680 --> 16:58.360]  when you make that first cross,
[16:58.360 --> 17:00.700]  so a lot of, you're asking mainly if it matters
[17:00.700 --> 17:02.740]  if we do the male or the female.
[17:02.740 --> 17:03.820]  It all matters.
[17:05.020 --> 17:06.340]  I don't think it's going to matter
[17:06.340 --> 17:07.940]  which is the male and which is the female.
[17:07.940 --> 17:09.260]  It's going to work.
[17:09.260 --> 17:10.920]  It's gonna come down to your selection.
[17:10.920 --> 17:14.760]  The first cross is going to open up Pandora's box.
[17:15.780 --> 17:17.060]  It kind of depends on which plant.
[17:17.060 --> 17:19.660]  Also, it depends on which plant carries the dominant trait,
[17:19.660 --> 17:22.220]  which one dominates the mix.
[17:22.220 --> 17:23.940]  I've talked about this in previous episodes.
[17:23.940 --> 17:25.940]  When we're breeding, a lot of the times,
[17:25.940 --> 17:27.740]  the goal is to mix the plants together
[17:27.740 --> 17:29.860]  to get two traits of a plant,
[17:29.860 --> 17:32.340]  one trait, traits of one plant, traits of another plant,
[17:32.340 --> 17:34.020]  mix those into one plant.
[17:34.020 --> 17:35.740]  You hope to see those traits,
[17:35.740 --> 17:39.020]  those alleles express themselves in the progeny.
[17:39.020 --> 17:40.180]  Sometimes you see weird shit.
[17:40.180 --> 17:41.940]  Sometimes you see stuff from the grandparents.
[17:41.940 --> 17:44.300]  Sometimes you don't see what you're expecting,
[17:44.300 --> 17:48.220]  but it all depends on the dominance, co-dominance,
[17:48.220 --> 17:52.200]  and not dominance of the genes of the traits of that plant.
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.720]  Sometimes I've talked about using a male plant
[17:54.720 --> 17:57.480]  that is too dominant, excuse me,
[17:57.480 --> 18:00.460]  a male plant that is too dominant in a mix.
[18:00.460 --> 18:02.780]  Imagine if you've got like just a dude
[18:02.780 --> 18:04.860]  that's just beastly all the time.
[18:04.860 --> 18:05.960]  He can't think real well,
[18:05.960 --> 18:08.500]  but he could fucking move a refrigerator with his left hand
[18:08.500 --> 18:11.300]  and you just, an ogre, just a real ogrely male.
[18:11.300 --> 18:13.240]  Maybe you wouldn't want to breed with that ogrely male
[18:13.240 --> 18:14.800]  because all the offspring are just gonna be
[18:14.800 --> 18:17.320]  fucking flat forehead, narrow eyed ogres.
[18:17.320 --> 18:19.440]  We don't need a bunch of ogres in the offspring.
[18:19.440 --> 18:22.020]  You want to see some of the female in the cross.
[18:22.020 --> 18:25.540]  So I would skip those real meathead, ogrely male plants
[18:25.540 --> 18:27.800]  because those are gonna be too dominant.
[18:27.800 --> 18:29.600]  If you've got a male or a female plant,
[18:29.600 --> 18:30.960]  that could happen on either side.
[18:30.960 --> 18:33.800]  You could have a super powerful fucking fem queen
[18:33.800 --> 18:36.520]  on one side or an ogrely dominant male on one side,
[18:36.520 --> 18:37.960]  and that will dominate your mix.
[18:37.960 --> 18:39.240]  And then your cross is just going to be
[18:39.240 --> 18:41.840]  more representations of the male or female.
[18:41.840 --> 18:44.920]  The cannabinoids are going to transfer the same way.
[18:44.920 --> 18:47.440]  If the male plant carries the THC
[18:47.440 --> 18:48.800]  and it's a super dominant plant,
[18:48.800 --> 18:50.720]  you're gonna see a lot of THC in the offspring.
[18:50.720 --> 18:53.460]  If the female plant is super dominant in the mix
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.240]  and carries the CBD, you're gonna see that,
[18:55.240 --> 18:57.200]  or vice versa, however it works.
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.960]  Just depends on kind of which plant is dominant
[18:59.960 --> 19:01.160]  in its gene passing.
[19:01.160 --> 19:04.520]  A lot of times we'd hope to see a perfect 50-50 mix,
[19:04.520 --> 19:06.500]  which is how it works, but expression,
[19:06.500 --> 19:08.160]  you're gonna see weird shit.
[19:08.160 --> 19:11.280]  So now let's talk about the weird shit we're gonna see.
[19:12.120 --> 19:15.040]  In my experience, from my, what you called expertise,
[19:15.040 --> 19:18.020]  which I'm not sure I qualify for, but thank you,
[19:18.020 --> 19:20.300]  when we first make this F1 cross
[19:20.300 --> 19:22.240]  with these varied cannabinoids,
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.160]  in my experience, in my prediction, with my expertise,
[19:26.160 --> 19:28.680]  what I've seen, what I think will happen is the F1,
[19:28.680 --> 19:31.280]  the first cross, you take your, either way,
[19:31.280 --> 19:34.040]  it doesn't matter if you've got a THC male or female,
[19:34.040 --> 19:37.460]  CBD male or female, you got CBD and THC,
[19:37.460 --> 19:40.040]  male or female, we're gonna cross them bad bitches.
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.240]  The first time, you're going to get
[19:42.240 --> 19:44.920]  very high CBD cultivars.
[19:44.920 --> 19:47.800]  You're gonna find very high THC cultivars.
[19:47.800 --> 19:49.560]  Then you're gonna find things in the middle
[19:49.560 --> 19:51.260]  and everything in between.
[19:51.260 --> 19:53.000]  You're just gonna open up Pandora's box
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.280]  and get a little bit of everything.
[19:55.280 --> 19:58.480]  At this point, I would find a female
[19:58.480 --> 20:00.380]  that is obviously high in CBD.
[20:00.380 --> 20:01.720]  I would try to do lab testing.
[20:01.720 --> 20:03.640]  That's the best way to find CBD.
[20:03.640 --> 20:05.520]  If that's really what you're looking for,
[20:05.520 --> 20:07.720]  find the one that is the highest in the CBD
[20:07.720 --> 20:09.960]  and lowest in THC.
[20:10.760 --> 20:11.600]  You also need to find the good grower,
[20:11.600 --> 20:12.960]  the one that grows well.
[20:12.960 --> 20:13.920]  So do the pheno hunt.
[20:13.920 --> 20:16.560]  Find the one that works best for you.
[20:16.560 --> 20:18.580]  Find the plant that looks like how you want
[20:18.580 --> 20:20.520]  your finished project to look like.
[20:20.520 --> 20:23.760]  What do you want the plant structure to be like?
[20:23.760 --> 20:24.640]  How do you want it shaped?
[20:24.640 --> 20:25.860]  Do you want long spaces?
[20:25.860 --> 20:27.920]  Do you want short internodal structure?
[20:27.920 --> 20:29.040]  Do you want long branching?
[20:29.040 --> 20:30.140]  Do you want short branching?
[20:30.140 --> 20:32.400]  What kind of plants are you into growing?
[20:32.400 --> 20:34.440]  Find the plant that grows the way you need it
[20:34.440 --> 20:36.800]  to grow for your purpose or the plant
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.240]  that is going to reach your goal.
[20:38.240 --> 20:42.040]  So now you've selected a female from the F1 progeny.
[20:42.040 --> 20:44.000]  Find a male from the F1 progeny
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.760]  that looks just like that girl if you can.
[20:46.760 --> 20:49.380]  Similar leaf shape, similar node structure,
[20:49.380 --> 20:50.480]  similar everything.
[20:50.480 --> 20:52.860]  Find its twin, except it's a boy.
[20:52.860 --> 20:55.920]  Then cross those two, pollinate that bad bitch.
[20:55.920 --> 20:58.040]  Now you've made the F2s.
[20:58.040 --> 21:01.840]  In those F2s, we are going to find a lot of crazy shit.
[21:01.840 --> 21:04.320]  We are going to find grandparents
[21:04.320 --> 21:06.360]  and great-grandparents expressing themselves,
[21:06.360 --> 21:09.800]  but we are also going to find beautiful representations
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.960]  of exactly what we're looking for for the F2.
[21:12.960 --> 21:15.560]  We found exactly what we want in this batch.
[21:15.560 --> 21:18.320]  You're gonna find that exactly the one with the CBD,
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.360]  the growth structure, exactly what you want in this batch.
[21:21.360 --> 21:23.840]  Then you're gonna find a male and you're gonna do it again.
[21:23.840 --> 21:25.880]  Now we are making the F3.
[21:25.880 --> 21:28.480]  Now at this point, we are actually beginning
[21:28.480 --> 21:32.100]  to lock in that CBD dominant trait.
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.240]  We have found the plants.
[21:33.240 --> 21:36.340]  So the F1, when you make that F1, it's gonna be wild.
[21:37.180 --> 21:38.020]  You're gonna have a lot of stuff.
[21:38.020 --> 21:40.860]  F2, even more wild, but there's gonna be a solid plant
[21:40.860 --> 21:42.260]  in there to work with.
[21:42.260 --> 21:44.660]  Then you're gonna use that F2 to make F3.
[21:44.660 --> 21:47.660]  The F3s are going, if we selected correctly,
[21:47.660 --> 21:49.740]  the F3s are going to start showing us
[21:49.740 --> 21:51.580]  exactly what we're looking for.
[21:51.580 --> 21:55.600]  If we did this correctly, at least 50% of the plants we grow
[21:55.600 --> 21:58.780]  should look like the plant we are looking for.
[21:58.780 --> 22:00.820]  Maybe closer to 60, maybe 70.
[22:00.820 --> 22:03.260]  It depends all about your selection.
[22:03.260 --> 22:05.460]  So at this point, here we go again.
[22:05.460 --> 22:07.580]  Find the plant that works very well for you,
[22:07.580 --> 22:10.380]  the one that makes the CBD, the low THC,
[22:10.380 --> 22:13.300]  the flavor you want, that grows, the structure,
[22:13.300 --> 22:16.100]  shape, time, all of the attributes that you need.
[22:16.100 --> 22:17.680]  Find those alleles for you.
[22:17.680 --> 22:18.980]  Find that plant.
[22:18.980 --> 22:20.780]  Find the female, find the male.
[22:20.780 --> 22:21.860]  Here we go again.
[22:21.860 --> 22:23.660]  Let's pollinate, let's cross them.
[22:23.660 --> 22:25.420]  Now we're making F4.
[22:25.420 --> 22:29.020]  Now at this point, your percentage of your stability,
[22:29.020 --> 22:32.180]  this is where the word stability really does come in here.
[22:32.180 --> 22:34.220]  This is where your stability will come into play.
[22:34.220 --> 22:36.540]  You're going to start increasing the stability
[22:36.540 --> 22:40.700]  every time you do this if you select correctly.
[22:40.700 --> 22:42.500]  If you don't make the right selection,
[22:42.500 --> 22:44.380]  you gotta go back to that F2, the F3,
[22:44.380 --> 22:47.000]  wherever you did see what you liked.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.580]  Go there, maybe the step before,
[22:48.580 --> 22:51.420]  and rework that, select different plants from the mix.
[22:52.260 --> 22:53.700]  So just keep working this.
[22:53.700 --> 22:55.740]  By the time you get to F4,
[22:55.740 --> 22:58.580]  you should be really close to what you're looking for.
[22:58.580 --> 23:02.900]  By the time you get to F5, you'll have what I called,
[23:02.900 --> 23:06.640]  what I wrote down as reliable, stabilized phenotypes.
[23:06.640 --> 23:08.480]  Most of the phenotypes are gonna come out
[23:08.480 --> 23:10.140]  looking like the plant you're looking for.
[23:10.140 --> 23:13.420]  By the time you get to F6, you've got basically clones.
[23:13.420 --> 23:18.140]  You're growing probably 95, 98% of the seeds you toss out
[23:18.140 --> 23:20.580]  are going to look exactly the same.
[23:20.580 --> 23:24.420]  So it doesn't really matter which plant has the THC,
[23:24.420 --> 23:26.300]  which one has the CBD.
[23:26.300 --> 23:27.660]  That first time you cross it,
[23:27.660 --> 23:30.540]  you're gonna get the whole mix of shit.
[23:30.540 --> 23:33.780]  The second time, you're gonna get an even wider mix of shit.
[23:33.780 --> 23:35.220]  Find the plants you like,
[23:35.220 --> 23:38.020]  keep moving forward and fill your generation
[23:38.020 --> 23:39.540]  with your goal in mind.
[23:39.540 --> 23:41.840]  Take a lot of notes.
[23:41.840 --> 23:43.160]  Never be afraid to go back.
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.420]  If you messed up and you're not seeing what you want
[23:45.420 --> 23:49.740]  in the F3, F4, go back, work the F2 again, start there.
[23:49.740 --> 23:50.980]  Then take a lot of notes,
[23:50.980 --> 23:53.260]  see what did and what did not work.
[23:53.260 --> 23:55.300]  Also, here may be a useful tip.
[23:55.300 --> 23:57.180]  When you were working with these plants,
[23:57.180 --> 23:58.340]  you've got a couple of options.
[23:58.340 --> 24:02.380]  You can take one male
[24:02.380 --> 24:04.380]  and you can pollinate multiple females.
[24:04.380 --> 24:06.020]  What is stopping you from taking one,
[24:06.020 --> 24:10.060]  the select male from your F2 population
[24:10.060 --> 24:11.740]  and pollinating three females?
[24:11.740 --> 24:14.180]  You got the tall one, the short one, and the squatty one.
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.820]  Pollinate all three of them,
[24:15.820 --> 24:17.180]  mark the seeds and grow those
[24:17.180 --> 24:18.860]  and see which one of those you like the best.
[24:18.860 --> 24:20.220]  What is stopping you?
[24:20.220 --> 24:22.980]  Nothing's stopping you from pollinating multiple females.
[24:22.980 --> 24:24.500]  So pollinating multiple females,
[24:24.500 --> 24:27.820]  each round will give you multiple avenues to work with.
[24:28.340 --> 24:30.380]  Then you can always cross those lines together.
[24:30.380 --> 24:32.340]  If you get one that has the structure you want
[24:32.340 --> 24:34.380]  and one that's got the CBD that you want,
[24:34.380 --> 24:36.580]  later on, cross those together.
[24:36.580 --> 24:38.420]  That's always a fun work parallel lines.
[24:38.420 --> 24:40.820]  Should I talk briefly on parallel lines?
[24:40.820 --> 24:41.940]  So in your first project,
[24:41.940 --> 24:44.320]  you were working strictly for CBD, right?
[24:44.320 --> 24:46.660]  So let's just breed for CBD on this side.
[24:46.660 --> 24:48.960]  All we're looking for is CBD,
[24:48.960 --> 24:52.300]  maybe growth also because you have to have stable plants
[24:52.300 --> 24:54.620]  that can support themselves, strong, healthy, vigorous plants
[24:54.620 --> 24:55.860]  is the word I'm looking for.
[24:55.860 --> 24:58.260]  So we're looking for plant growth and CBD on one side.
[24:58.260 --> 24:59.900]  We just breed for that.
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.820]  You just, just like I said before,
[25:01.820 --> 25:04.340]  F2, look for CBD and plant growth,
[25:04.340 --> 25:06.020]  F3 for CBD and plant growth,
[25:06.020 --> 25:08.560]  all the way up to F5, maybe F6.
[25:08.560 --> 25:11.980]  On another project, we're using the exact same seeds,
[25:11.980 --> 25:14.100]  except we're looking for different attributes.
[25:14.100 --> 25:15.920]  Let's say we're looking for,
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.700]  maybe it puts out a super strong grape aroma.
[25:19.700 --> 25:22.140]  So we're gonna breed other plants over here
[25:22.140 --> 25:25.160]  and we're looking for nothing but grape aroma.
[25:25.160 --> 25:26.000]  So we're gonna grow them
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.480]  and all the plants that don't smell like grapes,
[25:27.480 --> 25:28.320]  they get tossed.
[25:28.320 --> 25:30.720]  We're gonna F2 the grape smelling plant,
[25:30.720 --> 25:32.480]  gonna find an F2 that smells like grapes.
[25:32.480 --> 25:35.520]  We're gonna F3 that, F4, F5, F6,
[25:35.520 --> 25:36.960]  to where every time we grow it,
[25:36.960 --> 25:39.160]  it just smells like grapes every time.
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.480]  Then we cross our CBD dominant cultivar
[25:42.480 --> 25:44.920]  to our grape cultivar and we breed those together
[25:44.920 --> 25:47.800]  and you get fucking grape CBD out of your line,
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.560]  a true F1 that you've created all the way from F,
[25:51.560 --> 25:53.720]  yeah, that feels really fun to do, right?
[25:53.720 --> 25:56.800]  It's a lifelong project, maybe something to think about.
[25:56.800 --> 25:59.160]  That's just what I was saying when I say parallel lines.
[25:59.160 --> 26:00.920]  I said it, had to ramble about it.
[26:00.920 --> 26:01.840]  Thanks for listening to that.
[26:01.840 --> 26:03.320]  I hope you learned something on that.
[26:03.320 --> 26:05.040]  Let me get myself back on track here
[26:05.040 --> 26:08.200]  because I did freestyle most of the info
[26:08.200 --> 26:10.360]  coming out of this question here.
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.040]  A lot of this is going to rely on your selection.
[26:14.040 --> 26:16.720]  Luckily now we've got science, we've got labs.
[26:17.880 --> 26:19.240]  You can do predicated testing.
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.000]  If you're looking for CBD,
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.040]  you can take snippets or tissue samples
[26:24.040 --> 26:26.320]  of all of your plants and send them to the lab
[26:26.320 --> 26:28.800]  and they can say this plant has got the precursor
[26:28.800 --> 26:32.160]  for a lot of THC or the precursor for a lot of CBD
[26:32.160 --> 26:34.080]  and you can toss those high THC plants
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.120]  and keep those high CBD plants.
[26:36.120 --> 26:38.080]  Now you're just breeding out of,
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.320]  you've already got half your population eliminated,
[26:40.320 --> 26:41.920]  half your work is done for you,
[26:41.920 --> 26:44.320]  you know those cannabinoids are going to be there.
[26:44.320 --> 26:46.240]  Now you can grow for a structure.
[26:46.240 --> 26:47.840]  The other traits which you are looking for,
[26:47.840 --> 26:49.320]  you can focus more on that.
[26:49.320 --> 26:51.440]  Predicated testing will really help you out
[26:51.440 --> 26:54.480]  if that is available, affordable, cost effective,
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.760]  that will really speed you up in this program.
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.200]  You can identify the presence of CBD precursors
[27:00.200 --> 27:01.900]  early in vegetative growth.
[27:01.900 --> 27:03.440]  Yes, I know that sounds crazy,
[27:03.440 --> 27:06.400]  but then you can get rid of all those THC plants early
[27:06.400 --> 27:08.440]  and just breed for CBD.
[27:08.440 --> 27:10.060]  That will definitely help you move forward
[27:10.060 --> 27:11.580]  in your generations.
[27:11.580 --> 27:13.840]  All right, my friend, I folded up the paper,
[27:13.840 --> 27:15.560]  you wanted to be called Cedar City,
[27:15.560 --> 27:17.240]  can I make sure you follow them on Instagram?
[27:17.240 --> 27:18.840]  It's Cedar City, can I?
[27:18.840 --> 27:21.400]  Big shout out, big thanks for the great message.
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.040]  I hope I answered your question.
[27:23.040 --> 27:25.320]  You did ask which male and which female
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.320]  the traits would come from,
[27:26.320 --> 27:29.820]  but I think I gave you a good answer to your question.
[27:29.820 --> 27:30.960]  If you have any followups to that,
[27:30.960 --> 27:31.800]  I would love to hear from you.
[27:31.800 --> 27:35.000]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:35.000 --> 27:36.560]  Don't be shy, send me those questions,
[27:36.560 --> 27:39.360]  corrections, comments, concerns, positive criticism,
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.160]  what is it, constructive criticism, positive feedback.
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.000]  I look forward to all of the above.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[27:45.880 --> 27:48.200]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.020]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[27:50.020 --> 27:52.200]  all of you amazing cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[27:52.200 --> 27:54.000]  I wanna thank you once again for listening
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.440]  to episode 699 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[27:58.440 --> 28:01.080]  It does blow my mind every time I say that.
[28:01.080 --> 28:04.680]  Super high numbers, 700 is next, 710 is coming.
[28:04.680 --> 28:06.400]  I'm super excited.
[28:06.400 --> 28:08.720]  I think that's all I'm gonna ramble on for this episode.
[28:08.720 --> 28:10.960]  I look forward to seeing you in the next show.
