[02:23.520 --> 02:28.640]  be focused on teaching you and explaining what 710 is all about what is
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.040]  710 let's just jump right into it many of you probably already know about 420
[02:34.040 --> 02:37.200]  if you're watching this show if you're a cannabis consumer if you're part of the
[02:37.200 --> 02:42.720]  community you're probably very familiar with 420 420 is when we celebrate
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.560]  cannabis consumption we like to get together at 420 smoke a bowl it used to
[02:46.560 --> 02:49.920]  be the the code in high school hey bro you want to bust out a little 420
[02:49.920 --> 02:53.480]  between classes or meet me at this place at lunch for a little bit of 420
[02:53.480 --> 02:58.760]  or meet me at 420 for some 420 it was just kind of cool to smoke down at 420
[02:58.760 --> 03:02.800]  so 420 got super popular we all know about that if you haven't listened to my
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.840]  podcast about 420 it was started by a group of young men who called themselves
[03:06.840 --> 03:11.360]  the Waldo's they would meet every day after school at 420 and smoke together
[03:11.360 --> 03:15.320]  it kind of stuck that's why my friends and I a bunch of the Grateful Dead
[03:15.320 --> 03:18.760]  community is where it got popular then it traveled around a bunch of my friends
[03:18.760 --> 03:23.160]  and myself we all started saying 420 everybody around us was saying 420 it
[03:23.160 --> 03:27.760]  got super popular then we started seeing 420 festivals and 420 events it got
[03:27.760 --> 03:31.280]  really commercialized with the legalization of cannabis so that is
[03:31.280 --> 03:37.360]  where 420 came from and 420 got popular now let's segue into 710 what is 710
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.280]  with the evolution of cannabis legalization has also come the
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.520]  evolution of cannabis products one of the greatest things to come out of this
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.480]  evolution in my opinion is high quality cannabis concentrates if it's shatter if
[03:49.480 --> 03:54.000]  it's batter if it's rosin whatever it is I love a high quality cannabis
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.200]  concentrate when it first started getting popular BHO concentrates were
[03:58.200 --> 04:03.240]  known as oil they would come out looking like honey oil BHO butane honey oil I'm
[04:03.240 --> 04:06.680]  not gonna tell you how it's done but you would use butane and some products and
[04:06.680 --> 04:10.800]  the resulting product would look like oil and it would look like honey they
[04:10.800 --> 04:14.840]  call it butane honey oil we learned how to refine it do a bunch of different
[04:14.840 --> 04:20.400]  things to it but that BHO that butane honey oil I looked like oil so they were
[04:20.400 --> 04:25.120]  calling it oil then we realized that if you turn the number 710 upside down on
[04:25.120 --> 04:31.000]  the clock it does spell the word oil 7 1 0 flip it upside down it says oil that's
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.800]  why at 710 we smoke some oil that's why 710 has become the new 420 so that's why
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.320]  710 has become the new 420 we have upgraded a little bit I do find that 710
[04:42.320 --> 04:46.920]  is a little bit more convenient a lot of the time compared to 420 it takes me
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.800]  much less time to prepare and consume a dab than it does to prepare and consume
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.600]  as much cannabis as it would to get me where I want to be and also there's not
[04:55.600 --> 04:58.880]  as much aroma if you take a dab some of the dabs I've got on the table smell
[04:58.880 --> 05:02.520]  like straight-up candy so if I hit this blue fruit right here it's not gonna
[05:02.520 --> 05:05.440]  smell like I just smoked a blunt in the room it's not gonna smell like I smoked
[05:05.440 --> 05:09.960]  a fat joint it's gonna smell like this fruity blue candy incense potpourri
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.760]  delightful air freshener stuff so maybe a little bit easier to conceal and it
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.640]  makes it a little bit more convenient for a lot of reasons now we've talked
[05:18.640 --> 05:24.160]  about what 710 means 710 is simply oil upside down it is when we smoke a dab so
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.520]  a lot of you have that 420 alarm set on your phone when 420 comes you all got to
[05:28.520 --> 05:33.960]  get together and smoke a bowl bro at 710 we take dabs in Colorado so that's 710 a
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.680]  lot of places are taking dabs at 710 definitely here in Colorado so 710 is
[05:38.680 --> 05:43.640]  oil upside down and that is dab time I do want to give a big shout out to my
[05:43.640 --> 05:48.400]  friend Task Rock. Task Rock from highly educated titanium now also highly
[05:48.400 --> 05:54.080]  educated quartz also from Task and Linus T&L the movement big up to Task Rock
[05:54.080 --> 05:58.160]  also big shout out to our friends from Healthstone Glass there may have been
[05:58.160 --> 06:01.840]  other people in the room but to the best of my knowledge there was a meeting and
[06:01.960 --> 06:05.960]  people were talking about the new term and I think Task Rock is the one who
[06:05.960 --> 06:09.920]  coined the phrase 710 so I'm gonna go ahead right here on the show and give
[06:09.920 --> 06:13.880]  credit to Task for coining the phrase 710 I want to make sure that he got
[06:13.880 --> 06:18.840]  that now when we talk about 710 I keep saying the word dab many people might
[06:18.840 --> 06:24.360]  not even know what a dab is what is a dab a dab when I talk about a dab a dab
[06:24.360 --> 06:29.200]  is a hit of a concentrate a hit of a cannabis concentrate just a hit just one
[06:29.200 --> 06:32.760]  consumption the reason why we call it a dab let me just go ahead and get out a
[06:32.760 --> 06:37.160]  dab here I'm going to open a brand new package of blue fruit live batter from
[06:37.160 --> 06:40.400]  Green Dot Labs nobody pays me to talk about this product but I'm just gonna
[06:40.400 --> 06:44.040]  talk about it for the fun of it since we're here this is blue fruit live
[06:44.040 --> 06:48.760]  batter this is a blend of sex on the beach and black and blue two different
[06:48.760 --> 06:52.560]  strains extracted together in the same machine and the same device on the same
[06:52.560 --> 06:56.680]  run that makes one great tasting concentrate they do describe the flavor
[06:56.680 --> 07:01.120]  of this concentrate as blueberry cheesecake and exotic fruit on the back
[07:01.120 --> 07:07.600]  it says it contains 74.99% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD there's a
[07:07.600 --> 07:11.000]  little pull here tab we can pull this and probably get more information if we
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.080]  open this up I don't usually do that but let's see what's in here all right
[07:15.080 --> 07:18.400]  through the magic of editing I got that really quickly when I open the little
[07:18.400 --> 07:21.760]  book on the back of the package here I've never done this with this brand I
[07:21.760 --> 07:26.040]  don't think I pop it open and it says oh we should talk about this it does say
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.960]  the grow where it was grown and it says the infused product place where it was
[07:30.960 --> 07:34.920]  processed it's got those two numbers on there you can't see the numbers but I
[07:34.920 --> 07:40.080]  see them there's a 403 R and a 404 R number if you have any problem with this
[07:40.080 --> 07:43.520]  product they could trace this product back to that cultivation facility and
[07:43.520 --> 07:47.280]  that extraction lab so it's cool that they've got that on there just wanted to
[07:47.280 --> 07:51.360]  mention that it goes on inside this little book it says extracted using
[07:51.360 --> 07:57.560]  99.9% distilled and butane this product was produced without regulatory oversight
[07:57.560 --> 08:01.640]  for health safety or efficacy this product complies with testing
[08:01.640 --> 08:06.720]  requirements there may be long-term physical or mental health risks from use
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.880]  of marijuana including additional risks for women who are or may become pregnant
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.320]  or are breastfeeding use of marijuana may impair your ability to drive a car
[08:15.320 --> 08:19.740]  or operate machinery intended use inhaled product and I think that is the
[08:19.740 --> 08:23.020]  end of the book here that's the end of the story so it does come with a nice
[08:23.020 --> 08:26.940]  little warning label bunch of stuff on the inside here then we're gonna crack
[08:26.940 --> 08:32.140]  this open we are getting to the point oh it smells so good it smells disgustingly
[08:32.140 --> 08:36.900]  good the concentrates definitely this batter definitely has a really
[08:36.900 --> 08:41.140]  concentrated aroma in there as well I'm gonna try to show you this I don't know
[08:41.140 --> 08:43.660]  what you can see I don't want to lose my concentrates I just bought this I don't
[08:43.660 --> 08:47.140]  want it to fall out of the jar there but I want to put it up on the camera for
[08:47.140 --> 08:51.980]  you I'll pick it up I shouldn't do that but I'll kind of grab it show you that's
[08:51.980 --> 08:56.700]  a gram of green dot batter I don't know if it'll focus on that or not but we'll
[08:56.700 --> 09:01.420]  try I'll try to zoom in and editing there it is we'll put it in there I'm
[09:01.420 --> 09:05.460]  gonna show you why we call it a dab when we take a dab we go like this we scoop
[09:05.460 --> 09:10.620]  out just a little piece and most people would take I don't know if you can even
[09:10.620 --> 09:14.100]  see it on there because it's just a dab you just get a little dab just a little
[09:14.260 --> 09:18.140]  dab will do you that's kind of a big dab that would make Mike cough I'm not gonna
[09:18.140 --> 09:21.540]  show off I'm not trying to brag but this is the size of dab that I would normally
[09:21.540 --> 09:25.660]  do here scoop this up a little bit I know I'm not talking into the mic but
[09:25.660 --> 09:28.860]  this is the kind of dab that I would normally do something about this size
[09:28.860 --> 09:32.460]  that's that's a decent sized dab I'm gonna do that while we're here on the
[09:32.460 --> 09:37.540]  podcast in a minute so that's the size dab I would normally do so we scoop up a
[09:37.540 --> 09:41.980]  dab a dab is a hit of a concentrate now let me talk about what is a concentrate
[09:41.980 --> 09:46.100]  maybe concentrate doesn't even make any sense when we have cannabis we have
[09:46.100 --> 09:49.860]  dried cannabis flower tops that's usually what we consume we cut off the
[09:49.860 --> 09:54.220]  tops we cut off the leaves we try and cure the tops and then we smoke those we
[09:54.220 --> 09:58.720]  don't need all of the green leafy matter the vegetable part doesn't really do
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.660]  anything for us that is the carrier for the potent part the trichomes the little
[10:03.660 --> 10:06.300]  the crystals you guys call them the little mushrooms that are growing off
[10:06.300 --> 10:10.860]  the weed plants those are where the potency is hidden most of the potency is
[10:10.860 --> 10:14.700]  in the cap of that trichome through science and technology people have
[10:14.700 --> 10:19.700]  learned how to basically rinse or remove all of that potent part from the green
[10:19.700 --> 10:24.340]  part so that way we don't have to smoke a bunch of green shit to get stoned we
[10:24.340 --> 10:28.340]  can just smoke the important part we've taken the good part and washed it off
[10:28.340 --> 10:33.380]  basically using solvents or water we've learned how to just strip that potent
[10:33.380 --> 10:37.200]  part from the green leafy matter and then the green leafy matter is discarded
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.540]  the potent part is turned into a delicious batter which I do love to
[10:40.540 --> 10:45.540]  consume so that is what a dab is a dab is a hit of that concentrate when the
[10:45.540 --> 10:50.100]  phrase dab first started I think it did refer to a BHO concentrate because a lot
[10:50.100 --> 10:54.420]  of this movement did evolve because of the BHO concentrate movement when
[10:54.420 --> 10:57.940]  cannabis became legal I don't want to teach you too much about BHO about
[10:57.940 --> 11:02.420]  butane extracted products but that is how it is done people say it's not there
[11:02.420 --> 11:04.900]  people are going to say that's not safe that can't be healthy
[11:04.900 --> 11:08.600]  butane is very clean we know how to clean it out of the product there's none
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.880]  left in here it's lab tested we've been doing it for a while we know what we're
[11:11.880 --> 11:16.520]  doing it's fucking great products Rasta Jeff approved so back in the day a dab
[11:16.520 --> 11:20.640]  was a BHO hit now we call a dab basically anything if it's rosin if
[11:20.640 --> 11:23.980]  it's batter if it's shatter if you put it on the dabber and put it in the
[11:23.980 --> 11:28.200]  banger and take a dab of it that's a dab that's what they'll call it I just said
[11:28.200 --> 11:32.680]  a bunch of words right there that you may not even know so I said dabber what's
[11:32.680 --> 11:35.960]  the dabber the dabber is the little stick that I scoop up the dabber with
[11:35.960 --> 11:39.400]  that's all it is that's the dabber the stick that I went and put the dab on
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.320]  this is the dabber also I am a dabber I'm a person who consumes dabs I am a
[11:44.320 --> 11:49.360]  dabber so I've got my dabber just keep talking here there's more to cover
[11:49.360 --> 11:53.320]  concentrates there are a lot when I'd say concentrates that means a lot of
[11:53.320 --> 11:57.760]  different kinds of hash a lot of you older smokers you'll think of just old
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.280]  school hash water hash bubble hash that's just basic hash that is a
[12:02.280 --> 12:05.760]  concentrate you can dab that but it does make a mess on your banger
[12:05.760 --> 12:10.880]  sometimes you can make concentrates with dry ice I've seen people take a sieve
[12:10.880 --> 12:14.480]  bag and dry ice and product and just shake the shit out of it the dry ice
[12:14.480 --> 12:18.280]  works as a solvent that kind of freezes up the it works like how you get gum out
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.640]  of your hair it freezes up the the vegetables and then the crystals fall
[12:21.640 --> 12:25.120]  off basically that's not exactly but that's the short version of what happens
[12:25.120 --> 12:30.400]  I've seen people press stuff people can press plenty of stuff into concentrates
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.360]  they're shatter they're solvent lists there's so many different styles and
[12:34.360 --> 12:39.480]  preparations of dabs but all of that is concentrates all of that falls into the
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.080]  label of hash or concentrates there's a very good distinction between two types
[12:45.080 --> 12:49.760]  of concentrates that people really do love there is solvent lists and solvent
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.080]  based concentrates people like to make concentrates with heat I'm sure you've
[12:54.080 --> 12:57.920]  heard of people making rosin right now people are using any kind of heat and
[12:57.920 --> 13:01.600]  pressure you can use a hair straightener or a hydraulic press but
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.080]  with heat and pressure people are making rosin they're squeezing the potency of
[13:05.080 --> 13:08.520]  the potent part out of the plant squeezing it right out and getting that
[13:08.520 --> 13:12.280]  part that is a solventless product you didn't use any chemicals no solvents
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.760]  were used in the making of that product also people will consider water hash to
[13:16.760 --> 13:20.920]  be solventless because yes I do understand that water is a solvent but
[13:20.920 --> 13:24.760]  let me try to quote my friend Nick a tea here DJ Nick a tea thought from
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.200]  essential extracts has taught us that when we are making water hash water is
[13:30.200 --> 13:34.560]  not being used as a solvent because trichomes are not water soluble it is
[13:34.560 --> 13:39.440]  being used as an agitator we are using ice and water to simply wash the
[13:39.440 --> 13:43.480]  trichomes off of the plant we're not using it as a solvent so when we use
[13:43.480 --> 13:48.400]  water and ice to make hash that is technically solventless concentrates a
[13:48.400 --> 13:51.840]  lot of people really like the solventless people that have had seizure
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.760]  problems some older people they're afraid of the butane so a lot of those
[13:55.760 --> 13:59.280]  folks a lot of the younger the rosin heads they really love the solventless
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.120]  products then there are people like myself I really love a butane extracted
[14:04.120 --> 14:08.800]  product the product I'm going to dab was made I said a moment ago with 99.9%
[14:08.800 --> 14:14.960]  pure butane so that's a butane extracted product in my opinion the butane
[14:14.960 --> 14:19.720]  extracted products burn cleaner they don't leave any residue on the nail they
[14:19.720 --> 14:23.760]  don't need they don't leave any mess in my my rig I think they work a lot better
[14:23.760 --> 14:29.840]  for me I do smoke some rosin green dot makes an amazing garlic banger rosin it
[14:29.840 --> 14:35.240]  tastes disgustingly delicious it smells so grossly good it's like a garlicky
[14:35.240 --> 14:39.360]  trash can with hints of vomit I love it it sounds gross right give me all of it
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.840]  I'll take four grams right now I love that shit that's a rosin when I smoke
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.560]  that my lungs feel a little bit heavy it makes me a little bit it makes all of me
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.120]  heavy it makes me like want to sit down and like almost take a nap it makes my
[14:52.120 --> 14:55.600]  face and my eyes heavy it almost makes me want to cough and it leaves a little
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.480]  bit of a gook on my banger the rosin doesn't do that there are the red the
[15:00.480 --> 15:04.080]  live batter doesn't do that the live batter gets me a nice head buzz my eyes
[15:04.080 --> 15:08.280]  perk up I start getting wild I want to do some shit I get active and lively so
[15:08.280 --> 15:11.520]  that's the big difference between those two products but I do enjoy both of them
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.760]  just in different ways so the rosin from green dot is made without any solvents it
[15:17.760 --> 15:24.360]  is heat and water then the the BHO the batter is made with the butane of course
[15:24.360 --> 15:27.880]  and I do like both of those so we've talked about solventless and solvent
[15:27.880 --> 15:32.960]  concentrates let's talk about rigs I've said rig just a moment ago the thing
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.840]  that you smoke your oil through is a rig right an oil rig that's why we call it
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.000]  that I prefer a little rig this is my dab rig this is the one I have chosen
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.200]  I've got a lot of rigs I've got several rigs this is my favorite rig this is my
[15:47.200 --> 15:50.760]  go-to hitter try to hold it up here to where you could see it it's not very big
[15:50.760 --> 15:55.800]  it's just big enough to where when I put the dab in the this is a banger when I
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.360]  put the dab into the banger I'll put the carb cap on it we'll show you that in a
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.520]  moment the smoke will travel down through here through these bubbles I
[16:02.520 --> 16:07.240]  always prefer a something with water if I'm smoking concentrates I want it to go
[16:07.240 --> 16:11.720]  through water I'm gonna heat it up pretty hot I take a pretty pretty vicious
[16:11.720 --> 16:14.840]  size dab so I need some water to cool that down then it comes up through the
[16:14.840 --> 16:20.000]  water then I like this really flared out mouthpiece when I take a dab if the
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.600]  mouthpiece is too small I feel like the concentrate stick to my lips my mustache
[16:23.600 --> 16:27.360]  my teeth and I don't like that again I take bigger dabs than the average bear
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.520]  so I like the flared out mouthpiece this is my favorite rig in my collection not
[16:31.520 --> 16:35.500]  the most expensive not the shiniest the brightest but this one punches the
[16:35.500 --> 16:40.760]  hardest so I like a rig that is small just enough to get water and enough to
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.160]  get the fucking the smoke cooled off then a nice flared out mouthpiece
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.520]  something I do pay attention to when I'm buying the rig is how far from my eyes
[16:48.520 --> 16:53.360]  and face is the nail or the banger or the bucket going to be when I'm trying
[16:53.360 --> 16:56.400]  to take a dab am I gonna be able to carve it am I gonna be able to work the
[16:56.400 --> 16:58.840]  banger because I don't want it right here in my face where I'm all cross-eyed
[16:58.840 --> 17:01.960]  I don't need it down here by my fingers where I can't see it I don't need it up
[17:01.960 --> 17:06.520]  here where I got to look up and it's all awkward I like the way this one sits so
[17:06.520 --> 17:10.360]  when I'm buying a rig I look for something kind of small I look for
[17:10.360 --> 17:13.440]  something with a flared mouthpiece something that holds water and something
[17:13.440 --> 17:16.080]  that's not awkward when I'm gonna hit it something that's comfortable in my
[17:16.080 --> 17:19.080]  hand something that I can function with I'll show you what I mean I'm gonna put
[17:19.080 --> 17:23.760]  it to my face and kind of give you an example I like to go right here so I can
[17:23.760 --> 17:26.840]  look right into where my banger is where I'm gonna be lining up putting my dab
[17:26.840 --> 17:31.460]  into there you definitely manage that all the time not gonna miss not gonna go
[17:31.460 --> 17:34.160]  cross-eyed when they're too close I feel like I go cross-eyed and it just feels
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.720]  fucking weird so I like a little rig this is my rig I could have cleaned it a
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.040]  little better for you it's got some some dab residue in there but hey we've
[17:41.040 --> 17:46.480]  been dabbing that's what the rig is for so this is the rig I talk about this
[17:46.480 --> 17:49.440]  part this is the banger this part comes off right here this is a separate
[17:49.440 --> 17:53.760]  purchase this is a banger this is the part where you're gonna heat this and
[17:53.760 --> 17:57.000]  then you're gonna put your dab in here and then you'll put the carb cap on I'll
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.080]  show you the cap the cap fits on right here kind of swirl it around a little
[18:00.080 --> 18:06.560]  bit what that does when the cap goes on it creates a vacuum now the air cannot
[18:06.560 --> 18:10.680]  flow inside of this area because I've just sealed it off I'm also smoking
[18:10.680 --> 18:13.680]  through here at this time so I'm pulling air through here there's a small hole in
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.560]  the cap so I'm now restricting the airflow the heat in here now does not
[18:17.560 --> 18:20.720]  need to be as intense because I've created a vacuum it's like putting a lid
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.400]  on the pot I've trapped the heat in here now my dab will cook at a lower
[18:24.400 --> 18:29.120]  temperature it'll burn more cleanly more smoothly without so much heat less heat
[18:29.120 --> 18:32.000]  is a little bit better we're gonna talk about heat and temperature in just a
[18:32.000 --> 18:35.480]  moment but the less heat on there is better for your lungs better for your
[18:35.480 --> 18:39.280]  throat it doesn't burn as bad but the less heat will work better for you it'll
[18:39.280 --> 18:42.400]  taste better it won't mess up your throat your lungs it'll be a more
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.680]  enjoyable experience however I do enjoy a little bit of an excessively hot dab
[18:47.680 --> 18:52.360]  so this is my banger one thing I should mention is the sizes of bangers that are
[18:52.360 --> 18:57.720]  available this is a 14 millimeter I do believe that 14 millimeter is my
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.920]  favorite size for the joint now that all depends on the size of the joint on your
[19:02.920 --> 19:07.240]  rig your rig may have a male or a female joint this is a male joint on the
[19:07.240 --> 19:11.720]  rig a female joint on the banger obviously they meet just like that
[19:11.720 --> 19:16.500]  they're both 14 millimeters so you got a 14 millimeter 14 mil male female they
[19:16.500 --> 19:20.360]  connect like that this is a 90 degree banger goes at a 90 so it's nice and
[19:20.360 --> 19:26.120]  flat let me show you another option this my friends is a 10 millimeter let me get
[19:26.120 --> 19:28.480]  it out of here real carefully I don't want to break it it's only 10 millimeters
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.400]  it's kind of delicate that one's 10 mil it's a little bit skinnier it's
[19:31.400 --> 19:36.200]  obviously four millimeters skinnier that one's also a 90 degree this one is
[19:36.200 --> 19:39.520]  a male if you can see the shape on the end let me hold it over here this one's
[19:39.520 --> 19:43.520]  got that this one goes in right the piece that goes in is a male just like
[19:43.520 --> 19:47.060]  us the piece that goes in that's a male my rig is a female you see it's got a
[19:47.060 --> 19:51.120]  hole right there watch me do it a little bit a little bit of rig porn oh yeah
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.360]  that just sits in there just like that in this one I've got let me get them
[19:54.360 --> 19:59.000]  out of here so I could show you I have got these little guys little glass balls
[19:59.000 --> 20:02.600]  we call them turp pearls I'm holding two of them up to the camera right now
[20:02.600 --> 20:08.560]  tiny little glass balls I put these in here then when I take a dab I use a carb
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.840]  cap a spinner cap that makes those balls spin around the nail around inside the
[20:13.840 --> 20:18.200]  banger and what that does is it stirs my oil it stirs my dab and it makes it move
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.280]  around so it moves it around the hot surface of the bottom of the banger and
[20:22.280 --> 20:25.560]  my I get the whole dab I don't waste any of it I don't get a little puddle that
[20:25.560 --> 20:31.840]  didn't get roasted up for me so that is a 10 millimeter banger with a male joint
[20:31.840 --> 20:37.200]  on the banger and the one we've got over here is a 14 millimeter male oh I made
[20:37.200 --> 20:42.520]  it done that wrong this is a female 14 millimeter female 14 mil and then we've
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.820]  got a male 10 mil over there this is my I like this rig a lot this one is my
[20:46.820 --> 20:50.600]  favorite though all right so we've talked about the rig the nail or the
[20:50.600 --> 20:54.880]  banger there are other options there are a lot of other options for nails you
[20:54.880 --> 20:58.780]  could get a turps slurper which then you're gonna need a gasket and a marble
[20:58.780 --> 21:03.280]  and some other stuff for that there are other options that look different but
[21:03.280 --> 21:07.440]  they do the same thing you guys are this is my preference this just happens to be
[21:07.440 --> 21:11.920]  my preference I like these round bottom bangers with the carb cap on it that's
[21:11.920 --> 21:14.720]  just what I prefer it just hits real nice like I said I like the flared
[21:14.720 --> 21:18.880]  mouthpiece that's just it's all about preference find what you like now
[21:18.880 --> 21:22.080]  talking about finding what you like let's talk a little bit about dab
[21:22.080 --> 21:26.400]  temperature I said that I like to take my dad's a little bit too hot some
[21:26.400 --> 21:29.720]  people prefer them a little bit cooler if you don't have a dab right
[21:29.720 --> 21:34.880]  thermometer or an email dialing in your dab temperature can take a couple of
[21:34.880 --> 21:38.440]  dabs you may have to waste a couple of dabs to figure it out so my advice would
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.720]  be to just scoop up a dab then get your torch we didn't go over the torch I'm
[21:42.720 --> 21:46.800]  using it's basically a creme brulee torch from Amazon I like this one because
[21:46.800 --> 21:50.560]  it spits out two flames I don't know if the camera will catch this but there are
[21:50.560 --> 21:54.120]  two flames coming out of there they kind of blend into one in the camera it
[21:54.120 --> 21:57.800]  does have two little flames which really heats up the the stuff really quickly so
[21:57.800 --> 22:02.960]  my banger gets real hot real quick but I would scoop up my dab I would heat up my
[22:02.960 --> 22:06.560]  banger when I heat up the banger I heat it from the bottom corner this is a
[22:06.560 --> 22:10.760]  round bottom banger if it were a square bottom I would heat it where the floor
[22:10.760 --> 22:15.080]  and the wall meet that is kind of the the rule of thumb that I follow over the
[22:15.080 --> 22:18.360]  floor and the wall meet and I'll kind of work my way around it just a little bit
[22:18.360 --> 22:22.280]  but I heat right about here because I know just from dabbing a lot I know that
[22:22.280 --> 22:26.000]  when I put my dab in there that's where I'm gonna hit right there in that corner
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.200]  and then since I hold it kind of tipped it all tips to that direction anyway
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.520]  when I put the cap on it's gonna start spinning it around so I heat it I heat
[22:33.520 --> 22:37.640]  it until it almost starts glowing if it's dirty I'll clean it with the torch
[22:37.640 --> 22:41.760]  that's ridiculous I'll heat it until I see that it's hot then I let it cool
[22:41.760 --> 22:46.240]  down now I let it cool until I use my hand it's not hot right now I keep
[22:46.240 --> 22:49.360]  touching it's like a loaded gun I have to keep checking it or a maybe loaded
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.120]  gun I check it with my finger my hand the palm on my hand and I can tell by
[22:54.120 --> 22:58.920]  the palm of my hand when the dab is ready I want it to feel like if I pushed
[22:58.920 --> 23:05.080]  the banger into my skin it wouldn't burn the fuck out of me but it wouldn't be
[23:05.080 --> 23:08.320]  pleasant at all I'd be like oh I burn the shit out of myself but then it'd be
[23:08.320 --> 23:11.240]  red for a minute you might get a little blister but it's not gonna make a
[23:11.240 --> 23:15.760]  fucking big problem if it goes and fucks your skin up that's way too hot don't
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.680]  try it don't that's not a good way to test it but if it's sizzling up your
[23:19.680 --> 23:23.720]  skin that's too hot I want it to feel kind of like a painful pinch but not a
[23:23.720 --> 23:27.560]  scary burn when I get close when I'm just right about here it's like feeling
[23:27.560 --> 23:30.800]  the baby bottle like you just got to get it close and see what it feels like so
[23:30.800 --> 23:35.200]  once I feel like it's close then I just go it sometimes I'll give it a pull and
[23:35.200 --> 23:38.080]  I can tell the temperature of this nail by pulling through this water if it's
[23:38.080 --> 23:42.580]  still super hot don't do it it's still super hot so heat it up let it cool give
[23:42.580 --> 23:48.020]  it a feel then put the dab in there and be I I'm already inhaling as the dab
[23:48.020 --> 23:52.140]  goes in it's kind of like it just happens kind of simultaneously I've got
[23:52.140 --> 23:56.540]  a dab on the dabber I'll use the other end but I go it just happens like that
[23:56.540 --> 24:00.780]  so I'm inhaling I put the dab on there it starts smoking up a little bit if
[24:00.780 --> 24:07.300]  your dab goes and sizzles right away she was way too hot way too hot your lungs
[24:07.300 --> 24:11.980]  are gonna sizzle abort mission quit inhaling if it bubbles up real nice oh
[24:11.980 --> 24:16.700]  yeah next step sorry I forgot a step put your dab in there set the dabber down
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.500]  then grab your trusty carb cap and put that carb cap on top and watch that shit
[24:20.500 --> 24:24.300]  in there if it bubbles up and just boils really smooth you might have a pretty
[24:24.300 --> 24:28.980]  close temperature give it a good pool see what happens are you getting smoke
[24:28.980 --> 24:33.220]  as the smoke real thick as the smoke real thin if you're not getting any smoke
[24:33.220 --> 24:37.020]  if the dab didn't melt guess what not hot enough if that shit sizzled up right
[24:37.020 --> 24:41.540]  away way too hot just take a few more dabs and kind of feel remember where you
[24:41.540 --> 24:45.940]  were like this is way too hot this is way too cool and then find your middle
[24:45.940 --> 24:50.500]  ground if you do take a dab and you've got some concentrates puddled down here
[24:50.500 --> 24:54.740]  in the in the bottom of your banger put the carb cap on it hit it with the torch
[24:54.740 --> 25:01.220]  for two and a half to three seconds I know that's not much time but that's
[25:01.220 --> 25:05.380]  enough to get a reheat we call that a reheat so you got your carb cap on here
[25:05.380 --> 25:10.260]  and then you're just gonna hit it with set the torch down grab the cap and then
[25:10.260 --> 25:14.820]  hit it again I bet you'll get smoke that time that's a reheat so if that worked
[25:14.820 --> 25:20.700]  that means that the first time it was not hot enough I don't have super like
[25:20.700 --> 25:25.060]  super accurate dial it in advice to get the temperature that you want I prefer a
[25:25.060 --> 25:29.540]  hotter dab than most people for a while there was a trend of you got it waste it
[25:29.540 --> 25:33.940]  to taste it where people were burning it so low temperature that it would taste
[25:33.940 --> 25:37.580]  super good but you'd have to get two q-tips and clean up the fucking banger
[25:37.580 --> 25:40.980]  because they would leave so much junk behind I don't leave shit behind when I
[25:40.980 --> 25:44.460]  take a dab I take mine a little bit hotter than that but also sometimes I
[25:44.460 --> 25:47.820]  roast myself and I got to catch my breath and sit down for a minute but I
[25:47.820 --> 25:54.060]  kind of enjoy that so maybe I'm a sicko my advice like I said heat it up feel it
[25:54.060 --> 25:58.500]  with your hand feel it feel it is it too hot is it not hot enough take a dab
[25:58.500 --> 26:01.980]  maybe waste a few dabs what are you gonna do hang out with your girl get a
[26:01.980 --> 26:05.420]  gram or two of concentrates and just take a couple of dabs and dial it in
[26:05.420 --> 26:09.620]  you'll get one dab that will make you so high that you'll be satisfied take a few
[26:09.620 --> 26:13.460]  mental notes like it was way too hot it's not hot enough learn what you like
[26:13.460 --> 26:17.100]  you may like it a lot hotter than your bro your bro may like it a lot hotter
[26:17.100 --> 26:21.180]  than you you never know what people may like so dial in that temperature the way
[26:21.180 --> 26:25.020]  that is perfect for you another thing that you may want to do is get yourself
[26:25.020 --> 26:29.780]  an email what's an email now we've got devices that plug into the wall it's got
[26:29.780 --> 26:33.340]  a little wire that comes off of a box that hooks up to your banger or your
[26:33.340 --> 26:37.220]  nail or whatever device it may come with depending on what company you shop with
[26:37.220 --> 26:42.020]  on that box it's got a number which you set it to and that number will control
[26:42.020 --> 26:46.300]  the heat at the end of the nail then you can get a consistently heated nail every
[26:46.300 --> 26:49.620]  time you want to dab and it's always on if this were a neat had an email cable
[26:49.620 --> 26:52.500]  on it and I wanted to hit it I could just grab it right now take a dab there
[26:52.500 --> 26:55.700]  would be no need to heat it up no need to torch it it would already be ready
[26:55.700 --> 26:59.180]  already so that's an email that's a great device you could definitely dial
[26:59.180 --> 27:03.660]  that in get that completely perfect one thing I'm gonna say about the email
[27:03.660 --> 27:09.900]  most of those devices the number on that device does not correlate with the
[27:09.900 --> 27:15.380]  number on the surface of the nail in temperature it is just a number on the
[27:15.380 --> 27:20.060]  box it is probably it's like a volume setting on your car it's got one through
[27:20.060 --> 27:23.180]  whatever I'm gonna go with one through ten maybe your spinal tap and you got
[27:23.180 --> 27:27.260]  eleven but we got one through ten right I know that if I turn my car stereo up
[27:27.260 --> 27:30.700]  to ten it sounds like total shit I'm overdoing it the speakers can't handle
[27:30.700 --> 27:34.340]  it the gears not meant to do that I know if I hover around seven it fucking rocks
[27:34.340 --> 27:38.100]  it's as loud as I want to go I know if I get down to six that's cool for traffic
[27:38.100 --> 27:41.420]  when the cops come I go down to like number three if I'm trying to find an
[27:41.420 --> 27:44.460]  address I turn it down to number two why do I need it down so low to find an
[27:44.460 --> 27:48.020]  address this is weird shit that we do but what I'm getting at is that number
[27:48.020 --> 27:51.900]  on the one through ten on my car stereo doesn't mean that it's coming out at
[27:51.900 --> 27:55.740]  level ten on the speakers it doesn't know it's just one through ten and those
[27:55.740 --> 27:59.660]  are just arbitrary settings it's not one decibel or ten decibels it's just
[27:59.660 --> 28:04.180]  one through ten basically one through a hundred percent so what I'm getting at
[28:04.180 --> 28:09.340]  is on that box that's not a temperature on the nail that doesn't correlate as a
[28:09.340 --> 28:13.680]  temperature that's just a setting it's high medium low but find the number that
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.280]  works for you and set it at that number but don't think that that number is the
[28:18.280 --> 28:21.820]  exact temperature that your nail is at because I don't think that that works
[28:21.820 --> 28:26.140]  that way if you want to find out get yourself a dab right and then put the
[28:26.140 --> 28:29.860]  dab right under there turn on the email and see what the dab right measures that
[28:29.860 --> 28:32.340]  may be a good thing if you're new to dabbing and you want to spend some money
[28:32.340 --> 28:36.420]  a dab right is a great device I do not have one I've thought about getting one
[28:36.420 --> 28:40.140]  if dab right would like to advertise on the podcast what's up guys I'll trade
[28:40.140 --> 28:43.460]  you a dab right for a couple of ads here we'll use it on the show it may work out
[28:43.460 --> 28:47.020]  I'll do it on Instagram live anyway enough pitching myself also your ad
[28:47.020 --> 28:50.100]  could be here if you'd like to do some advertising on the show reach out I'm
[28:50.180 --> 28:53.860]  fucking high and rambling get an email you guys check that out dial that in but
[28:53.860 --> 28:56.980]  don't think that the number on the email is actually a temperature I think it's
[28:56.980 --> 29:00.420]  actually a frequency like megahertz or something that's probably more likely
[29:00.420 --> 29:06.180]  what that is for on the road dabs I like the puff Co a lot of times allegedly
[29:06.180 --> 29:10.660]  possibly you may see me hitting this rig in the car if not I may be hitting a
[29:10.660 --> 29:15.420]  puff Co a puff Co Pro puff Co peak whichever the newest one is it's growing
[29:15.420 --> 29:18.020]  on me at first I didn't like them they take a lot of maintenance and care but
[29:18.020 --> 29:22.260]  they are growing on me another thing I should talk about is a nectar collector
[29:22.260 --> 29:26.860]  nectar collectors are great if they've got some water my buddy Tanasia is a big
[29:26.860 --> 29:30.340]  fan of the honey badger big shout out to our friends at the honey badger if you're
[29:30.340 --> 29:35.180]  looking for an email I recommend a Colorado company called the beanale
[29:35.180 --> 29:38.740]  check out the beanale tell them Ross to Jeff sent you I'm going kind of fast
[29:38.740 --> 29:41.500]  because I feel like I've been going for a long time my throat's getting dry I
[29:41.500 --> 29:44.660]  want to talk about it some more things and most importantly I want to take a
[29:44.660 --> 29:48.300]  big fat dab for you and show you how I do it something else you're gonna need
[29:48.300 --> 29:52.420]  if you're gonna start taking dabs are q-tips I mentioned q-tips earlier after
[29:52.420 --> 29:55.940]  I take a dab there's gonna be a little bit of stuff left in here possibly maybe
[29:55.940 --> 29:59.420]  I do grab a q-tip and I just give it a couple of good swirls clean all that
[29:59.420 --> 30:03.500]  shit out there so my banger is clean and fresh for the next lovely contestant
[30:03.500 --> 30:07.220]  who's gonna step up and take a dab there are other great accessories you can
[30:07.220 --> 30:10.180]  think about I talked about the turt pearls that I've got in here they do
[30:10.180 --> 30:14.540]  sell a little grabber so you could pull the pearls out and clean those I like to
[30:14.540 --> 30:19.900]  use a product called dark crystal glass cleaner dark crystal is from Canada it's
[30:19.900 --> 30:24.340]  a great product I use it quite often on a lot of my products I probably cleaned
[30:24.340 --> 30:27.460]  all the shit on the table with it recently it's a good product my shits
[30:27.460 --> 30:30.460]  dirty now so don't judge my stuff by don't judge the product by that I've
[30:30.460 --> 30:35.060]  been using it but a dark crystal is a great glass cleaner I recommend that
[30:35.060 --> 30:41.580]  you've got 10 14 and 18 millimeter bangers I really like a rig with water in
[30:41.580 --> 30:46.020]  it I think I've covered all of the notes so one of my favorite things about
[30:46.020 --> 30:50.340]  dabs is most of the flower that you buy that you can buy that is available in a
[30:50.340 --> 30:55.940]  Colorado dispensary is going to come in somewhere between 19 and 30 percent THC a
[30:55.940 --> 31:01.780]  if we look at the back of this container of concentrates this product contains
[31:01.780 --> 31:09.500]  74.9 percent THC a one big fat dab of this is like basically smoking two or
[31:09.500 --> 31:14.140]  three regular size joints to the face by yourself and I get to get all that
[31:14.140 --> 31:18.380]  potency into my bloodstream into my lungs into my face into my brain just
[31:18.380 --> 31:22.900]  that quick one quick fat dab maybe a fat cough and then after that I can move on
[31:22.900 --> 31:26.180]  with my business I don't have to sit here and roll up three or four joints
[31:26.180 --> 31:29.780]  and smoke three or four joints and cough a bunch of times and smell like herb and
[31:29.780 --> 31:34.100]  I could just smoke a big fat dab don't get me wrong I do love smoking flowers
[31:34.100 --> 31:38.420]  but sometimes that dab is what I need speaking of dabs I'm gonna take a little
[31:38.420 --> 31:42.140]  sip of a frosty cool beverage I've already got part of a dab up here on the
[31:42.140 --> 31:45.740]  dabber we're gonna heat up the nail we're gonna kind of do a little tutorial
[31:45.740 --> 31:48.820]  I'll show you guys how I take a dab then we're gonna wrap this up
[31:48.820 --> 31:54.020]  all right podcast world I do apologize I was interrupted by the UPS guy bringing
[31:54.020 --> 31:58.260]  me a cool package that we will talk about on a future episode let's get back
[31:58.260 --> 32:02.860]  into the show here I was about to do a dab and wrap up the show it does occur
[32:02.860 --> 32:06.940]  to me that maybe I should start doing the wrap-up before I hit a dab so that
[32:06.940 --> 32:10.460]  the show does make some sense here at the end so let's start wrapping up the
[32:10.460 --> 32:14.940]  show I'm going to heat up my dab nail my banger while I do ramble then we will do
[32:14.940 --> 32:18.660]  a dab and we will say goodnight let me start like this ladies and gentlemen

[33:21.780 --> 33:25.220]  temperature here it's a little bit too warm still I could tell because it feels
[33:25.220 --> 33:28.700]  like I would burn the shit out of myself if I touched it right now but it is
[33:28.700 --> 33:32.340]  getting super close so I'm gonna move the microphone out of my way I want to
[33:32.340 --> 33:35.780]  give a big shout out to my buddy purple skunk and until next time take a fat
