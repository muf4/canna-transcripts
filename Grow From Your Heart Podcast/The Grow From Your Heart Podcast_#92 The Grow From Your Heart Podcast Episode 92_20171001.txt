[00:11.200 --> 00:23.250]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 92 of the Grow From
[00:23.250 --> 00:28.930]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education and conversation. That's right.
[00:28.930 --> 00:32.370]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[00:32.370 --> 00:36.490]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:36.490 --> 00:41.930]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host, Nikomi Rastajev.
[00:41.930 --> 00:45.610]  Thanks again for joining me. As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to
[00:45.610 --> 00:50.010]  the Mystic Roots band for letting me play their music on the show. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:50.010 --> 00:54.170]  Coop and the entire Mystic Roots crew. How are you guys doing? I hope everyone's having
[00:54.170 --> 00:57.370]  a great week. I hope everyone's having a good Monday or whatever day it is when you're listening
[00:57.370 --> 01:03.410]  to this. I'm smoking on some dabs of some amnesia haze. I hope you are smoking something
[01:03.410 --> 01:07.050]  delicious right now. You guys, I have had a great couple of weeks. I'm going to read
[01:07.050 --> 01:10.970]  a few news articles here today. But first, I want to ramble about a few things that I
[01:11.010 --> 01:15.450]  have gotten to do this past couple of weekends. This episode is going to come out way after
[01:15.450 --> 01:19.810]  this, but the movie Straight Outta Compton recently came out. And a lot of you guys don't
[01:19.810 --> 01:24.290]  know that I actually grew up in Southern California. I grew up at the intersection of Belfar Boulevard
[01:24.290 --> 01:31.250]  and Compton Boulevard. So I was blocks away from the actual city of Compton. NWA used
[01:31.250 --> 01:36.370]  to come do record signings and appearances at a record store about a block away from
[01:36.370 --> 01:42.450]  my house. So when I was like 10 years old, I actually met Eazy-E and NWA and the whole
[01:42.450 --> 01:48.610]  NWA crew. I met Ice Cube. I met Snoop. I met MC Ren. I met Dr. Dre. There was another guy
[01:48.610 --> 01:54.770]  with them called himself DJ Speed. Yellow was there. There were a few more guys there.
[01:54.770 --> 01:59.090]  And I remember I was a little kid, but I do remember that their album was huge. I'd already
[01:59.090 --> 02:03.930]  had the Straight Outta Compton CD. I was singing Fuck the Police all day long. I was like 10
[02:03.930 --> 02:07.810]  years old walking around my neighborhood singing Fuck the Police and Dope Man. But
[02:07.810 --> 02:11.290]  when they showed up to the record store, I remember the management of the record store
[02:11.290 --> 02:16.690]  looking pissed off because they were stupid high. Everybody in NWA showed up for that
[02:16.690 --> 02:21.450]  record signing smelling like they'd just smoked a blunt in Eazy-E's van. So seeing the movie
[02:21.450 --> 02:26.190]  Straight Outta Compton kind of was very reminiscent for me. It took me back to my old neighborhood
[02:26.190 --> 02:30.650]  in my mind. It took me back to those times. Brought me back to a lot of memories. It was
[02:30.650 --> 02:35.210]  really cool to see that. The movie was freaking awesome. It was a great movie. I'll give that
[02:35.210 --> 02:40.490]  five golden pot leaves. I would recommend the movie Straight Outta Compton to anybody.
[02:40.490 --> 02:46.090]  The guy that played the manager, Paul Giamatti, I think his name is. He did a hell of a job.
[02:46.090 --> 02:51.650]  All the actors did a great job. They actually used Ice Cube's son to play Cube. He did a
[02:51.650 --> 02:55.870]  great job. I think everybody was perfect. Hell of a good movie. I would recommend you
[02:55.870 --> 03:01.350]  guys go see that. You've probably already seen it by now. If you haven't, go see it.
[03:01.350 --> 03:05.950]  There's one really comedic line in the movie that made me laugh my ass off. That was one
[03:05.950 --> 03:10.910]  of my best parts, my favorite parts of the movie. That whole scene was actually one of
[03:10.910 --> 03:15.270]  my favorite parts of the movie. From the beginning of that scene until the joke that ends the
[03:15.270 --> 03:21.270]  scene, that was one of my favorite parts. One thing I did notice, I don't remember which
[03:21.270 --> 03:25.310]  character it was, but the manager character, Paul Giamatti's character, the manager, he
[03:25.310 --> 03:29.590]  had this guy named Jerry. One of the rappers were having a private conversation over a
[03:29.590 --> 03:35.790]  meal and they completely repeated a section of dialogue. It seemed weird to me. It felt
[03:35.790 --> 03:40.870]  like a bad editing job. Being somebody that edits podcasts and shit, I felt that the repetition
[03:40.870 --> 03:45.150]  of that dialogue was kind of a waste of time. It felt like this to me. I'm going to kind
[03:45.150 --> 03:49.590]  of do what I felt like I saw on the show. The manager said, so we can't continue like
[03:49.590 --> 03:52.630]  this because we're going to go broke. The other guy replied, well, yeah, but this is
[03:52.630 --> 03:56.190]  how we fucking live because we're gangsters. Then the manager said, but we can't continue
[03:56.190 --> 03:58.990]  to live like this because we're going to go broke. The other guy said, yeah, but that's
[03:58.990 --> 04:02.470]  how we live because we're fucking gangsters. Then the movie kept going. I looked at my
[04:02.470 --> 04:06.110]  date and I was like, did they just repeat some shit? It was really awkward. It didn't
[04:06.110 --> 04:10.710]  feel right in the movie. Other than that, that was the only flaw I found. Great movie.
[04:10.710 --> 04:14.350]  The Straight Outta Compton movie gets five golden pot leaves. Let's move on to my next
[04:14.350 --> 04:19.470]  little chicken scratch on this paper. Let's see. This Saturday or last Saturday it would
[04:19.470 --> 04:25.350]  be. I was invited to the High Plains Comedy Fest in Denver, Colorado. The High Plains
[04:25.350 --> 04:29.670]  Comedy Fest is a comedy festival, of course, right? It's what it's called. They do these
[04:29.670 --> 04:35.190]  shows throughout different clubs in the Denver, Colorado area. Some of the performances were
[04:35.190 --> 04:41.150]  at the High Dive. Some of the performances were at Mutiny. Some of the performances were
[04:41.150 --> 04:45.630]  at Three Kings. Then later on at night, performers were headlining at places like the Paramount
[04:45.630 --> 04:50.750]  Theater and Comedy Works. I was invited by my friend Baker. What's up, Baker? I don't
[04:50.750 --> 04:55.950]  know if you listen to the podcast, but if you do, big shout out, much love. Baker is
[04:55.950 --> 05:01.590]  a good friend of mine. He is linked up with the comedy world. It is Baker's fault that
[05:01.590 --> 05:05.790]  I have gotten to smoke weed and hash with some of my favorite comedians. You guys, I'm
[05:05.790 --> 05:10.870]  not going to name drop. I got to smoke hash and weed with a lot of my favorite comedians.
[05:10.870 --> 05:15.510]  People that you listen to, people that have podcasts, that we listen to their podcasts.
[05:16.390 --> 05:21.510]  I was kind of blown away. I was standing on Broadway in Denver, just smoking joints and
[05:21.510 --> 05:27.110]  bowls with world-class comedians. They were all treating me like I was one of them. It's
[05:27.110 --> 05:30.790]  mostly Baker's fault. It was also because I had the good weed. Big shout out to my buddy
[05:30.790 --> 05:35.330]  Baker. Big shout out to the High Plains Comedy Festival. I had a wonderful freaking time.
[05:35.330 --> 05:39.510]  Also a big shout out to our friends at Grassroots California. Unfortunately, the Grassroots
[05:39.510 --> 05:44.910]  store had to close their doors, but they had an awesome sale. I was able to go in there
[05:44.910 --> 05:50.590]  and grab several Grassroots hats for the price of two. I'm styled out. All right. I
[05:50.590 --> 05:53.830]  think that's enough catching up and humble bragging about what I've gotten to do for
[05:53.830 --> 05:59.150]  the past couple of weekends. Of course, Fish is coming up here on the next weekend. You
[05:59.150 --> 06:04.390]  guys will get to hear a lot about that. Let's go ahead and get into some of the news articles
[06:04.390 --> 06:09.310]  that I have pulled up for you guys. If you have been following the show, you will remember
[06:09.310 --> 06:15.790]  that recently there was a raid in California of a dispensary. When the police raided this
[06:15.790 --> 06:21.230]  dispensary, first of all, they treated all of the people inside of the dispensary like
[06:21.230 --> 06:27.390]  complete shit. They were completely disrespectful to a woman in a wheelchair. Then they cleared
[06:27.390 --> 06:31.830]  out the dispensary and proceeded to destroy this dispensary, but they did not realize
[06:31.830 --> 06:37.870]  that they were on a hidden camera. As they destroyed the dispensary, they destroyed displays,
[06:37.870 --> 06:42.790]  they destroyed the security systems. They just tore this place apart. It was terrible.
[06:42.790 --> 06:49.790]  As they were doing this, they were caught on camera eating edibles from the dispensary.
[06:49.790 --> 06:55.790]  The lawyer for the dispensary found the tape, edited the tape, and put it... It was put
[06:55.790 --> 07:00.830]  up on YouTube. It was all over the internet. Also, they were trying to file a case against
[07:00.830 --> 07:07.590]  the law enforcement officials that were responsible for this raid and for the eating of the edibles.
[07:07.590 --> 07:14.870]  Once the video was introduced and a court case was presented, the Santa Ana police tried
[07:14.870 --> 07:22.070]  to stop this footage from being used in a raid because they were under the presumption
[07:22.070 --> 07:27.790]  of privacy since they had already taken down all of the cameras in this dispensary. These
[07:27.790 --> 07:31.550]  cops came in, destroyed the dispensary. They were caught on hidden camera doing shit they
[07:31.550 --> 07:36.590]  should not have done. Then they tried to block the video from being used as evidence in a
[07:36.590 --> 07:41.510]  case against them. Now I'm reading on the Huffington Post. This is an article by a guy
[07:41.510 --> 07:47.870]  named Matt Ferner. The headline says, Judge says video allegedly showing cops eating marijuana
[07:47.870 --> 07:54.310]  candy can be used as evidence. The sub-headline is, An internal investigation of three California
[07:54.310 --> 07:59.710]  police officers can use security camera footage from a dispensary raid. I think that this
[07:59.710 --> 08:04.950]  is great news. I'm going to go ahead and read the article. It is from Los Angeles. It says,
[08:04.950 --> 08:08.870]  Orange County Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that a controversial surveillance
[08:08.870 --> 08:13.190]  video allegedly showing three police officers eating marijuana infused candy and mocking a
[08:13.190 --> 08:18.750]  disabled woman during a May dispensary raid can be used in an internal investigation by the Santa
[08:18.750 --> 08:23.790]  Ana Police Department. The unidentified officers and their union, the Santa Ana Police Officers
[08:23.790 --> 08:28.710]  Association, filed a temporary restraining order earlier this month to block the video from being
[08:28.710 --> 08:33.670]  used in an ongoing internal investigation for the officers conduct during the raid. The police
[08:33.670 --> 08:38.190]  argued their privacy was violated when surveillance cameras recorded them from inside Sky High
[08:38.190 --> 08:43.590]  Holistic Medical Marijuana Dispensary after they thought they had disabled all of them. Superior
[08:43.590 --> 08:48.470]  Court Judge Ronald Bauer rejected that notion on Wednesday, the Orange County Register first
[08:48.470 --> 08:53.110]  reported, saying that the officers had no objectively reasonable expectation that their
[08:53.110 --> 08:59.350]  actions and words during the raid would not be observed. The officers should not expect privacy
[08:59.350 --> 09:04.630]  on their on duty performance of an official function at a marijuana dispensary. Bauer ruled
[09:04.630 --> 09:09.430]  they have made no claim that their work required secrecy or that it would be impeded by public
[09:09.430 --> 09:14.670]  view. Matthew Pappas, the dispensary's attorney, said the ruling is a critical victory for holding
[09:14.670 --> 09:19.590]  police and public officials accountable for their actions. This ruling shows that the court had the
[09:19.590 --> 09:23.830]  courage to say no to a very powerful police officer union and stand up for the rights of
[09:23.830 --> 09:28.870]  people who had bad things like this happen, Pappas told The Huffington Post. Pappas released edited
[09:28.870 --> 09:34.070]  footage of the May 27th raid in June that was published by various local news outlets. The edited
[09:34.070 --> 09:37.950]  video which can be seen on YouTube, it's also here in this article. If you guys want to see it, go to
[09:37.950 --> 09:44.310]  the HuffingtonPost.com, type in, let's see, where will you find it? Just type in marijuana raid and I'm
[09:44.310 --> 09:51.590]  sure you will find this. I need to find where I was now. Here we go. The edited video which can be
[09:51.590 --> 09:57.470]  seen shows officers busting down the door and ordering everyone on the ground at gunpoint, which
[09:57.630 --> 10:02.670]  that's where the whole comedy starts. They're battering using a battering ram to pound in this
[10:02.670 --> 10:07.350]  door. And the funny part is that the business was open. All they had to do was turn the handle and
[10:07.350 --> 10:12.470]  pull and they could have gotten in very easily. Instead they used a battering ram and pushed really
[10:12.470 --> 10:17.030]  hard instead of just gently pulling. So it says the footage according to Pappas shows police
[10:17.030 --> 10:22.310]  unsuccessfully disabling the shop surveillance cameras which go on to record the officers playing
[10:22.310 --> 10:27.990]  darts eating something which he argues is marijuana infused infused food and making a joke
[10:27.990 --> 10:33.230]  about an amputee who uses a wheelchair. Did you punch that one legged old Bonita? One officer
[10:33.230 --> 10:38.830]  asks. I was about to kick her in her fucking nub. A female officer replies to laughter. Corey Glave,
[10:38.830 --> 10:43.750]  the attorney representing representing the officers and their union argued that the video was edited
[10:43.750 --> 10:48.590]  to distort the officers behavior during the raid. He previously told the HuffPost that at least one
[10:48.590 --> 10:54.350]  officer voluntary voluntarily took and passed a drug test, the results of which were were provided
[10:54.350 --> 11:01.070]  to the SAPD. Pappas denied the video was doctored. The full video is more than 12 hours long, he said
[11:01.070 --> 11:06.150]  so he released edited versions with subtitles to show that what officers were allegedly saying the
[11:06.150 --> 11:11.350]  entire video has been made available to the police department and that they have seen the full
[11:11.350 --> 11:16.150]  unaltered version. Oh, and that they have seen the full unaltered version. Papa said, sky high
[11:16.150 --> 11:20.630]  holistic has filed a multi million dollar lawsuit against the police department, alleging that the
[11:20.630 --> 11:25.670]  officers used excessive force during the raid. The dispensary is also seeking the return of its
[11:25.670 --> 11:30.830]  property seized during the raid, which includes marijuana, cannabis infused edibles, and thousands
[11:30.830 --> 11:36.070]  of dollars in cash. A hearing regarding the return of the seized property is scheduled for Friday.
[11:36.230 --> 11:41.590]  Glave and the SAPD did not immediately respond to requests for comment following the judge's
[11:41.590 --> 11:47.710]  ruling. So it looks like the ruling has been made. Oh, no, the ruling has been made that the video will
[11:47.710 --> 11:53.790]  be usable. I will research the hearing regarding the return of the seized property. I'm going to make a
[11:53.790 --> 11:59.170]  note of that. Sorry, it takes me a minute to write legibly, but I'd rather take a break and write it so
[11:59.170 --> 12:05.270]  that I remember to do it. Alright, so they will be able to use this video in court, which is a great
[12:05.270 --> 12:09.870]  thing. Because if you were I were arrested, and there was a video of whatever we were doing, that
[12:09.870 --> 12:14.670]  video would be used against us in court, everything we say and or do will be used against us in a court
[12:14.670 --> 12:19.990]  of law. And even if we think that we have some sort of assumption of privacy, they're not going to give
[12:19.990 --> 12:25.150]  us any privacy. This is America big brother is watching you're on camera somewhere. So keep that
[12:25.150 --> 12:30.270]  in mind you guys, but I'm just glad that they're going to use this video. Because I think it's fucked
[12:30.270 --> 12:35.390]  up that these cops can act like they're trying to do something just and useful for us and then just go
[12:35.390 --> 12:40.870]  in and be thugs. They were gangsters. They went in there and fucking stole and destroyed shit. They
[12:40.870 --> 12:47.550]  were vandals. They need to be held accountable. That's my opinion. So I will keep you updated. I'm
[12:47.550 --> 12:51.750]  going to do some research on what happened to the property. I hope they get their cannabis back. I
[12:51.750 --> 12:56.150]  hope they get their money back. I hope they get their edibles back. I hope they make that cop pay
[12:56.150 --> 13:00.110]  for the edible that he bought and ate. And then I hope they also sue the fuck out of them for all the
[13:00.110 --> 13:06.950]  wages they've lost and the mental anguish. I hope this comes back to bite this police force in their
[13:06.950 --> 13:12.830]  asses. All right. I've got another article. This one comes from the beautiful city of Pueblo,
[13:12.830 --> 13:18.190]  Colorado. You know, Facebook has been bustling about the city of Pueblo, Colorado and cannabis. I
[13:18.190 --> 13:23.190]  read a fact today. You know, I can't say that it's a fact. But I've seen this in more than one place. I
[13:23.190 --> 13:30.790]  have seen and read that Pueblo, Colorado now produces the most legal cannabis anywhere of
[13:30.790 --> 13:35.310]  anywhere on the planet. We produce more legal cannabis than anywhere. We are now the new golden
[13:35.310 --> 13:41.030]  triangle here in Pueblo, Colorado. I would believe that our rules are great. Things are affordable
[13:41.030 --> 13:45.950]  here. The climate is perfect for growing cannabis. And everybody is moving here to grow weed.
[13:46.150 --> 13:50.430]  Everybody is coming to Pueblo, Colorado. So from what I've seen on Facebook and on the internet
[13:50.430 --> 13:56.670]  here, Pueblo, Colorado has become the new Emerald Triangle. We produce more cannabis than anywhere
[13:56.710 --> 14:04.530]  else in the world, or at least the country. I don't know about the whole world. All right, so this
[14:04.530 --> 14:10.490]  news article, I try that again, because I stumbled. This news article comes from High Country News.
[14:10.610 --> 14:15.490]  And the headline is the Silicon Valley of marijuana. Local officials want Pueblo County, Colorado to
[14:15.490 --> 14:21.330]  be the best place to grow. But not everyone is high on the idea. This article is written by a guy
[14:21.330 --> 14:25.810]  named Joel Warner. And I will read it for you. Actually, this is great, because it starts off with a
[14:25.810 --> 14:32.850]  picture of the spot dispensary. And a lady says Tammy White, age 52, shows her son and his friend the
[14:32.850 --> 14:38.170]  products she bought at the spot 420 in Pueblo West. They drove from Florida for the week. So Tammy, who
[14:38.170 --> 14:43.290]  has chronic back pain from bone spurs could buy and smoke pot legally. There are a lot of great pictures
[14:43.290 --> 14:47.850]  in this article. I did not realize that. I'm going to scroll through the pictures right quick. If there
[14:47.850 --> 14:53.970]  any more from Pueblo, I will share them with you. Where's that? A Pueblo resident who moved from
[14:53.970 --> 14:57.650]  Maryland to work in the industry smokes pot while overlooking the marijuana plants he grows in his
[14:57.650 --> 15:04.170]  backyard. He was hired at a greenhouse five days later. So there's a picture of some guys, mediocre
[15:04.170 --> 15:10.330]  pot grow. And this guy's grown some mediocre pot in his backyard and his backyard's a mess. But
[15:10.330 --> 15:17.170]  anyway, we'll keep looking through these pictures here. Oh, this guy's in Pueblo West. It says it put
[15:17.170 --> 15:21.490]  his full name Bill Rader age 60 carries his favorite marijuana plant outside to soak up the sun at
[15:21.490 --> 15:25.810]  Pueblo West campground where he has been living for two months. Rader a veteran from Missouri who
[15:25.810 --> 15:30.590]  smokes because he can't take pain pills is one among many people who have moved to Pueblo from out of
[15:30.590 --> 15:35.010]  state to take advantage of marijuana legalization. This dude's living in a mobile home and it just
[15:35.010 --> 15:40.210]  has pot plants sitting right outside the mobile home here and he lives in an RV park. That's kind
[15:40.210 --> 15:49.210]  of weird. Let's see. Oh, there's the open vape rep. I know that guy from the shop. Rick Ortiz waters
[15:49.210 --> 15:54.610]  plants at Los Cienos and outdoor marijuana farm and here's a dude just watering a bunch of clones.
[15:54.730 --> 16:00.850]  There's some great pictures in this article big big shout out to the photographer. I recommend you
[16:00.850 --> 16:06.750]  guys reading this article. There we go. That's a great shop of my or a great photo of my shop. John
[16:06.750 --> 16:12.310]  Verna age 25 the grower at the spot 420 turns the lights on and a newly constructed grow showroom where
[16:12.310 --> 16:16.910]  marijuana will be cultivated visitors will be able to tour the warehouse. You guys if you go to
[16:16.910 --> 16:21.870]  highcountrynews.com and you look at the article the Silicon Valley of marijuana. There is an actual
[16:21.870 --> 16:29.030]  photograph of the shop where I work the grow room in which I work. One of my rooms it is in this
[16:29.030 --> 16:32.630]  article so I encourage you to go take a look. All right. I've been rambling for a long time. Let's get
[16:32.630 --> 16:39.470]  into this article. It goes like this. Mark Morley looks out over 30 acres. He owns east of Pueblo, Colorado and
[16:39.470 --> 16:44.750]  imagines the future on his on this blustery May afternoon. There's little more than mud and puddles
[16:44.750 --> 16:49.910]  here bordered by highway and railroad tracks and flanked by farm buildings and rolling hills. But by the end of
[16:49.910 --> 16:57.030]  September, if all goes well, he'll be looking at a pungent green thicket as 14,400 marijuana plants reach their
[16:57.030 --> 17:02.310]  full eight foot height. It's one of several major outdoor grows launching this summer in Pueblo, Colorado.
[17:02.550 --> 17:08.630]  Eventually Morley plans to expand into another 15,000 acres, investing in center pivot irrigation,
[17:09.390 --> 17:17.750]  greenhouses and processing facilities able to handle 40,000 plants. Morley age 55 and dressed in jeans, flannel
[17:17.750 --> 17:23.510]  shirt and a Tigers baseball cap is a major Colorado Springs real estate developer. After a marijuana dispensary
[17:23.510 --> 17:28.710]  opened in one of his buildings, he realized how lucrative the business could be. Why he wondered, Am I not doing this
[17:28.710 --> 17:35.750]  myself? If he planted corn on his corn on his land, each acre would require approximately 2.2 acre feet of water per
[17:35.750 --> 17:43.190]  year and produce $768 in annual sales according to Rachel Zan Canela, a Pueblo based Colorado Division of Water
[17:43.190 --> 17:51.870]  Resources engineer. That same acre planted with marijuana would require roughly 2.65 feet of water 2.65 acre feet of
[17:51.870 --> 18:00.630]  water, excuse me, and gross morally $6 million. Welcome to the big business of rural read. Ever. Rural weed. I'm sorry, that's
[18:00.630 --> 18:06.790]  hard to read. Ever since the local steel industry collapsed in the 1980s, Pueblo County has been seeking an economic savior.
[18:07.070 --> 18:14.230]  Nearly a third of its population is on public assistance. And in 2000, the metropolitan area around its eponymous city had the
[18:14.230 --> 18:21.270]  highest unemployment rate in the state. When Colorado voters passed Amendment 64 in 2012, paving the way for legalized
[18:21.270 --> 18:27.750]  marijuana, the county commissioner saw a chance for revival. They hired Brian Vicente, the Denver lawyer who helped write the ballot
[18:27.750 --> 18:35.910]  initiative to craft rules for growing and selling pot outside city limits. As a result, a result about 50 entities, including Morley are now
[18:35.910 --> 18:41.790]  licensed or conditionally approved to do so in the county. Historically, the biggest opponent of marijuana reform has been the
[18:41.790 --> 18:49.630]  government, Vicente says. Here the tables have turned. No one else in history has taken as comprehensive look at establishing marijuana
[18:49.630 --> 18:57.150]  business laws. Pueblo County's economy he adds has gone through the roof. And you guys this is my my town. This isn't this is where I live.
[18:57.150 --> 19:03.990]  I've lived here since I was approximately 15 years old. I've left a few times I've been back. But I've been here for quite a while. I have
[19:03.990 --> 19:12.830]  seen this town go from just a small po town. It was a little podunk kick town when I moved here. And then it turned into a city. And then it got
[19:12.830 --> 19:19.550]  going. And then we had some things happening and people were buying houses and moving in. And then at one point, everything stopped. It seemed
[19:19.550 --> 19:27.550]  like everything fell apart and everybody went poor here. Myself included. I was struggling. I worked shit jobs to get myself through you
[19:27.550 --> 19:34.270]  know, then I grew weed on the side because it was the only way that I can make ends meet was to grow some cannabis. Now that we've got this
[19:34.270 --> 19:45.950]  legal cannabis industry. Obviously, I am doing great for myself. I have a legal job, I can go to work and pay taxes. Now. It really helps our whole
[19:45.950 --> 19:56.350]  economy. Because the people that were, I'm going to say 22 to about 35. Around here, there wasn't a lot for us to do. We could either work at gas
[19:56.350 --> 20:04.070]  stations, or we could work at a telemarketing place, or we could work crap jobs. But with all of the cannabis industry that has boomed up, myself and all of
[20:04.070 --> 20:13.670]  my friends are living very well. Most of us grow weed, most of us trim weed, most of us are bud tenders. Nine out of 10 of my friends are involved in the
[20:13.670 --> 20:22.350]  cannabis industry in some way. And none of us are hungry for anything anymore. We've all got everything we need. None of us have to be criminals anymore. We don't
[20:22.350 --> 20:28.870]  have to do anything shady. We don't have to watch our backs. We don't have to look over our shoulders. We go to work nine to five or whatever we do. We work
[20:28.870 --> 20:35.070]  eight hour, 10 hour days. And you come home from work and you don't have to worry about hustling. You don't have to worry about being a drug dealer. You don't have to worry
[20:35.070 --> 20:45.990]  about the stupid shit that comes along with an illegal pot industry. I think it's a great way to revive an economy. You get benefits and health insurance and pay
[20:45.990 --> 20:54.430]  taxes. I mean, you can't do that when you're growing weed in the basement and selling it illegally. You're not part of the cogs of the community that make a society
[20:54.430 --> 21:04.350]  work in the eye of that society. You are a black market drug dealer. Even though you spend all your money at all the restaurants and all the stores in town, people don't realize that. Now, they don't
[21:04.350 --> 21:11.870]  freak out when I walk into Applebee's and buy dinner for me and all my friends or wherever we go, go to Qdoba and buy the whole crew dinner. They don't look at you like dirty drug dealer. They look at you
[21:11.870 --> 21:20.310]  like, oh, that man has a job. That's kind of nice. It's a big difference. Feels different. It feels better. I'm going to continue on with the article. It says, but the area's relationship
[21:20.310 --> 21:50.270]  with pot means remains ambivalent. This is after all a place where irate voters recalled their state senator over new gun restrictions. Some worry that the county's latest growth industry is bringing social problems along with money and others doubt whether the bold experiment will reap the promised rewards. Up to the 1970s, Pueblo was known as PU town because of the steel mill says Paula Mcfeeders, co founder of Pueblo for positive impact, which is a which opposes the county's pot friendly laws. Now we're getting known for that again because of marijuana.
[21:50.310 --> 22:20.150]  That group shows up at all this, let's see Pueblo for positive impact. They show up at all of the city council meetings, and they try to fight down cannabis and the cannabis use. But honestly, guys, they don't do any research and they don't know what they're talking about. So if a few members that do support cannabis would show up, we could shut these guys up every week. Lately, Mike is the only one that goes to the meetings. So I'd like to ask you guys to come to city council meetings when they happen on Mondays and help us speak positively about cannabis.
[22:21.190 --> 22:49.750]  I'm a hypocrite because I can't make it to every meeting. But I do go and I do try to voice my opinion when I can. Sorry, I'm burping. Excuse me, I'm going to continue with article it says the city of Pueblo is sometimes called the Pittsburgh of the West. And like it's steel town sister city back east. It's glory years lie in the past call centers, one of the few active industries dot it's downtown area. Pueblo County Director of Economic Development Chris Marcus and says that one of his predecessors used to drive potential business owners down the east
[22:49.750 --> 23:19.350]  sides crumbling streets and past crack houses and say enthusiastically, look at these people, they'll work for anything, hoping that the promise of achieve labor force would prove irresistible. Amendment 64 gave local governments the power to decide whether and how to permit recreational pot within their communities. The Pueblo City Council, for example, banned recreational pot shops and grows within city limits. It reacted similarly, when medical marijuana was legalized in 2000, placing a moratorium on dispensaries, the Colorado marijuana enforcement divisions
[23:19.350 --> 23:48.750]  2014 annual report says that 228 local jurisdictions have voted to prohibit medical and retail marijuana operations. Pueblo County, however, rolled out the welcome mat. Marijuana stores don't require a lot of space, a lot of space, but indoor grow operations can says Pueblo County Commissioner Terry Hart and Pueblo County got hit pretty hard on the recession. So we had a lot of empty commercial buildings throughout the county that realtors were trying desperately to fill. Like some other pot friendly communities. The county made
[23:48.750 --> 24:18.730]  marijuana businesses a use by right in industrial and business districts, meaning they weren't subject to sometimes time consuming and arduous special reviews or approvals by local government. But Pueblo County offered something beyond cheap real estate. Unlike Denver, it had an abundance of of available agricultural land. So local officials made marijuana cultivation a use by right here right there to likely the first Colorado County to do so according to Vicente and Joan Armstrong, Pueblo's Pueblo County's planning director.
[24:19.470 --> 24:47.970]  The county had also issued pioneering rules that prohibit hemp grows with male plants from being located within five miles of existing marijuana grows. This prev this prevents cross pollination that can lower the marijuana plants THC content while increasing THC and hemp which can exceed point 3% under state law. So that does make sense. Although they kind of worded this weirdly, you can tell they don't know what they're talking about. But the city also issued rules saying that you cannot grow hemp
[24:48.370 --> 25:16.770]  within five miles of a cannabis grow, which is a great thing because like they say here it prevents cross pollination, which we're not too worried about getting the cannabis into the hemp because we're not growing male plants outside all of our growers are pro growers and we've gotten rid of the male the only males you would find would be on the hemp farms and we don't need the hemp farms fucking up the cannabis plants. I'll continue with the article it says even the Pueblo Board of Waterworks, the local utility that leases water for businesses and agricultural use is trying to accommodate the industry.
[25:17.170 --> 25:32.970]  Last year when the Bureau of Reclamation Reclamation explicitly prohibited the use of federal water for pot cultivation water boy water board employees calculated that they could lease up to 800 acre feet of raw water to marijuana cultivators without running afoul of the feds.
[25:32.970 --> 25:50.970]  This was completely new territory for us as resources manager Alan Ward, who notes 92 acre feet of the so called marijuana water was already under contract as of this May, when Amendment 64 was first passed, I didn't put much thought into how it was going to affect my job. But for a few months, it seemed like it was nearly all I was focused on.
[25:50.970 --> 26:17.970]  The new rules are more than paying for themselves. In 2014, the county netted $1.8 million from licensing licensing fees for pot establishments and marijuana sales taxes, covering the cost of its virtual marijuana department and boosting its general fund. Since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. Most banks are still cagey about allowing pot businesses as customers. That means county staff have gotten used to pot owners popping tens of thousands of dollars in cash on their desks.
[26:17.970 --> 26:46.970]  Markeson says charter buses filled with Wall Street investors have been touring local farmland. There's talk of branching Pueblo grown pot along the lines of Pueblo green chili, another celebrated local crop. He has a Pueblo green chili is famous shit here. We have a chili festival in September. Come get your green chilies. You'll smell them from miles away. See some good bands playing. But they're trying to brand the Pueblo grown pot which I've been growing Pueblo grown pot for several years. That's a marketing tactic. I'm fucking with you.
[26:47.970 --> 27:06.970]  I'm fucking on it. Real estate prices are rising to industrial properties have nearly doubled in price to $50 per square foot square foot just since June of 2014 says local realtor Kendall Curtis. And now that the first outdoor grows and greenhouses are materializing, agricultural land prices have doubled up to $10,000 an acre.
[27:06.970 --> 27:26.970]  All in all the Southern Colorado growers association, the local marijuana trade orgs and organization claims the industry has provided 1300 new jobs and contributed more than $120 million to the local economy. You guys I can list 25 people I know that have jobs because of this boom in cannabis and they all work at the spot.
[27:26.970 --> 27:55.970]  There's one shop that I can list 25 people that are employed because of this cannabis industry and that is one shop and I think there are 14 or 16 shops just in Pueblo West. So that's a lot of people that are employed because of cannabis. The county is also hoping to attract marijuana testing labs and processing plants. Pueblo could be the Silicon Valley of marijuana says Marcus in the county's economic development director. He'd prefer that he'd prefer that to becoming Napa Valley to a let me try that line again.
[27:55.970 --> 28:24.970]  He'd prefer that to becoming a Napa Valley clone. The county wants to export its products not host busloads of marijuana tourists. Former growers association president Tommy Jai don't as a Pueblo native restaurateur and radio organizer who hosts an annual country music festival east of the city. He opened a dispensary nearby but he doesn't smoke pot. I'm 49 years old he says once they legalize it. I wasn't going to be like whoo-hoo I'm going to be a pothead which that's not cool. You don't have to be a pothead just to consume cannabis.
[28:24.970 --> 28:53.970]  The fact that Pueblo County wants to keep a fairly low profile hasn't appeased the industry's critics though marijuana hearings are heated. County commissioners have received threatening phone calls and growers worries that some zealot with a crop duster could devastate the outdoor harvest. Our commissioners rushed headlong into this without consulting the county residents complaints Pueblo for positive impact McFeeders. I guess that's the head the head of that organization that allowed a glut of marijuana stores and indoor grows to spring up in the Pueblo in Pueblo West the unnamed Pueblo cannabis.
[28:53.970 --> 29:22.970]  Pueblo West the unincorporated suburb where she lives. Yeah, like I said, they're like 14 shops out there and you know what none of them cause any problems. We have armed security guards people pull into our parking lot. They walk into our store. They make a purchase just like they would any other store. There's a sandwich shop right down the street. There is a saw and tool shop right down the street. The San Isabel electric is right across the street people pull up in their car. They walk in and they do business. They walk back out to their car and they drive away. Nothing bad happens. They're just like a normal person.
[29:22.970 --> 29:51.970]  They just drive away. Nothing bad happens at our dispensary. If you try to do something stupid at our dispensary or security guard will walk outside and tell you to leave. If I see you smoking on the premises of our dispensary, I will tell you to get the hell out of there. I'm rude about it. So you can't smoke here. Get the fuck out of here. What are you trying to do? And you people just drive away. I've got somebody smoking in the back while I was headed for my lunch break. They just drove away. We don't tolerate that shit. We don't want it. We are a business. We're not there to cause problems. We're there to make money. I don't see why people are so wrapped up and not having a conversation.
[29:51.970 --> 30:13.970]  Wrapped up and not having a dispensary around them. I'll continue with the article. The growth has come at a steep social cost. McPheeters and other critics say marijuana related crimes, including the 2014 armed robbery of a marijuana shop, have increased according to under Sheriff J.R. Hall. Meanwhile, local affordable housing organizations and shelters have been flooded with families who traveled here hoping to find jobs.
[30:13.970 --> 30:33.970]  In the first four months of 2015 alone, 306 households relocated to Pueblo because of marijuana, says Ann Stadelman, who directs a non-profit housing assistance organization called Posada. It is not easy to get a good paying job in the pot industry, Stadelman says. Many people can't pass the background checks and other checks needed.
[30:33.970 --> 31:02.970]  These people are saying that cannabis is causing problems because there was a break in, an armed robbery of a marijuana shop. That's one incident. That shit happens at gas stations and liquor stores once a week around here and nobody says shit about it. It happened to one dispensary and it's fucking headline news. I dismiss your one. There are so many days in a year and so many dispensaries that this one is going to happen. That's just shit that you expect.
[31:02.970 --> 31:26.970]  In society, and then they say these 306 households that relocated to Pueblo because of marijuana, we didn't send you an invitation. We didn't ask them to come. We didn't bring them here without a job. That is their fault. That's not cannabis's fault. They tried to move here without getting a job first. They tried to move here without getting the proper paperwork to work in the industry. They moved here without knowing how to trim. They just showed up. That's not our fault. That's not cannabis's fault. That's poor planning.
[31:27.970 --> 31:45.970]  I'm going to continue with the article. It says, and the problems could have repercussions far beyond Pueblo County. In February, a local couple filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court claiming that the pot girl next door devalued their property. It's one of two lawsuits aimed at striking down Colorado's system on the grounds that it conflicts with federal drug laws.
[31:46.970 --> 32:03.970]  Even if the state laws stand, Pat Oglesby, a tax attorney who studies marijuana at the Center for New Revenue in North Carolina, isn't sure how much Pueblo's head start in the reefer race will ultimately pay off. A 2015 report he co-authored concluded that roughly 20,000 acres of pot would supply the entire U.S. market.
[32:04.970 --> 32:22.970]  It sounds like they have a plan to really have a huge amount of supply while other jurisdictions aren't licensing any growers. So you could see the county gaining a short-term advantage and having a huge market share, says Oglesby. Whether that is an advantage that can be kept over time, I don't know.
[32:22.970 --> 32:51.970]  So he's saying, let's see, where did he say that? 20,000 acres of pot would supply the entire U.S. market. I don't know how accurate that is, you guys, because right now, there is no pot on the street. The street has ran out of weed because people don't want to go to dispensaries. And right now in my area, there is usually weed abundant. There is usually some dank-ass herb on the streets. If you want to sack weed, it's not a problem to get an ounce for somewhere between 150 to 200 bucks for some fire.
[32:52.970 --> 33:10.970]  Right now, an ounce of weed is always 200 bucks if you can find a good ounce. So something's going on. They're smoking up all the weed. I don't know that 20,000 acres would supply the entire U.S. market because there are medical patients that smoke a half ounce a day. They turn it into concentrates or edibles and they'll consume a half ounce a day.
[33:10.970 --> 33:30.970]  So this guy may be underestimating this. He's going by just numbers that have been gathered by polls. Oh, excuse me, I'm burping. He's going by numbers that have been gathered by social scientists or whatever, and those numbers are probably not accurate because people aren't honest when people do polls and surveys. I'm going to keep reading, you guys.
[33:30.970 --> 33:47.970]  It says, in the meantime, the tiny town of Boone, population 339 in eastern Pueblo County, seems grateful for the boost. Entrepreneurs Mark Morley and Jeff Aoti, a food plant developer originally from the East Coast, stop in Boone one afternoon for lunch after comparing notes on their developing grow operations.
[33:47.970 --> 34:11.970]  Aoti bought a nearby 500 acre ranch where he spent 6.6 million installing the first 16 cutting edge large scale greenhouses that will require 150 employees. He already has several boonies, as he calls them, on his crew, and he's paying some of them to fix up the town's century old Veterans of Foreign Wars building where Morley and Aoti dine on frozen pizzas and Dos Equis beers at the bar.
[34:12.970 --> 34:32.970]  Yes, there is still a sign on the VFW's wall declaring a zero tolerance policy for drug use. The bartender Edna Rivera doesn't flinch as the two pot barons brainstorm about recruiting Israeli cannabis researchers. As she rightly observes between serving up rounds of beers, if it makes money, I don't care.
[34:33.970 --> 34:57.970]  So you guys, this article is about my hometown. It makes me kind of proud to see that we are the Silicon Valley of marijuana. I'm kind of proud to have been in this since the beginning. I was the manager and lead bud tender at the very first and only dispensary to ever exist in the city of Pueblo, Colorado. Right now there are no dispensaries in Pueblo, Colorado. We had the only shop. We were shut down by the city.
[34:58.970 --> 35:14.970]  That makes me proud to see that we have bloomed to become the Silicon Valley of marijuana. In this article there are three pictures that came from my dispensary. There's a picture of our building with our Bob Marley on it. There's a picture of our badass, one of our grow rooms with my buddy John Verna in there. What's up, John? I hope you're listening, bro.
[35:14.970 --> 35:36.970]  And then I'm looking at a picture. We've got a map inside of the dispensary and it's a map that all of the visitors can put a pin in the state where they are from or the city where they're from. And they put a little picture of our map in there and it's getting filled up. You guys, somebody from every state has been to our dispensary. It looks like, Oh, what's this up here? Maybe not up in Maine. And there's somebody from Maine. Somebody from Maine has been to our shop.

[37:56.280 --> 37:58.280]  Meet a police out of shape.
[37:58.280 --> 38:08.440]  And when I'm finished, if they fags or what? Such a nigga.
[38:09.440 --> 38:27.390]  Black police showing out for the white cop. Ice Cube will swarm on any motherfucker in a blue uniform. Just cause I'm from the CBT.
[38:28.390 --> 38:29.390]  Police are afraid of me.
[38:30.390 --> 38:39.550]  Yo Dre, I got something to say.
[38:40.550 --> 39:02.960]  I'm taking your black ass to jail.
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.960]  MC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident?
[39:08.960 --> 39:10.960]  Fuck the police and re-insert it with authority.
[39:11.960 --> 39:13.960]  Because the niggas on the street is a majority of gang.
[39:14.960 --> 39:18.960]  Whoever I'm stepping and a motherfucking weapon is kept in a stash.
[39:19.960 --> 39:20.960]  But for the so-called long, wish you ran.
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.320]  Start flashing behind me.
[39:26.320 --> 39:28.320]  But the skin of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me.
[39:28.320 --> 39:30.320]  But that shit don't work, I just laugh.
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.320]  Because it gives them a hint, not to step in my path.
[39:34.320 --> 39:35.320]  But police, I'm saying fuck you punk.
[39:36.320 --> 39:37.320]  Read my rights and shit, it's all junk.
[39:38.320 --> 39:39.320]  Pulling out a silly club, so you stand.
[39:40.320 --> 39:42.320]  With a fake ass badge and a gun in your hand.
[39:43.320 --> 39:45.320]  But take off the gun so you can see what's up.
[39:46.320 --> 39:47.320]  And we'll go at it punk and I'm a fuck you up.
[39:48.320 --> 39:49.320]  Make you think I'm a kick your ass.
[39:50.320 --> 39:52.320]  But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast.
[39:53.320 --> 40:00.330]  Them sneaker that sweats me.
[40:01.330 --> 40:02.330]  Any asshole that threatens me.
[40:02.330 --> 40:03.330]  I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope.
[40:04.330 --> 40:06.330]  Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me.
[40:07.330 --> 40:09.330]  The motherfucking villain that's mad.
[40:10.330 --> 40:11.330]  With potential to get bad as fuck.
[40:12.330 --> 40:13.330]  So I'm a turn it around.
[40:14.330 --> 40:16.330]  Put in my clip, yo, and this is a sad.
[40:17.330 --> 40:26.000]  Make it like Ren don't give a fuck to say.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  Fuck boy.
[40:53.250 --> 40:55.250]  Why don't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this boy.
[40:58.480 --> 41:00.480]  Sweating my gang while I'm chilling in the shack.
[41:01.480 --> 41:02.480]  And shining a light in my face.
[41:05.140 --> 41:06.140]  Because I kick so much, but I kick ass.
[41:06.140 --> 41:07.140]  I kick ass.
[42:05.540 --> 42:09.540]  Jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker.
