[01:47.550 --> 01:54.270]  I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends
[01:54.270 --> 02:00.070]  To support the show ladies and gentlemen, I've been talking about the outdoor season approaching
[02:00.070 --> 02:05.390]  It has been getting very nice here then in Colorado. We did get a random snowstorm here
[02:05.390 --> 02:09.110]  So I do feel bad for everybody that put their plants out too early
[02:09.110 --> 02:15.430]  I was I had the foresight the forethought the the awareness to wait an extra week before I put my plants out
[02:15.430 --> 02:20.590]  But I am excited to say that today I was able to put plants in a greenhouse
[02:20.590 --> 02:26.350]  I do have a greenhouse breeding project happening this year. I am very excited very eager to tell you about that
[02:26.350 --> 02:29.190]  I don't want to leak too many details right here on this episode
[02:29.190 --> 02:34.830]  There will be an episode with very many details coming up, but stay tuned because I am super excited
[02:34.830 --> 02:38.970]  I've got some plants in a greenhouse this year. That's as close to outdoor as I get
[02:38.970 --> 02:42.710]  I don't do a lot of outdoor but the greenhouse is ideal. It's in a great location
[02:42.870 --> 02:48.490]  Nobody knows where it is. That is perfect for me. Nobody even knows that there's a greenhouse there. It is beautiful
[02:48.490 --> 02:53.190]  So I've got a greenhouse set up with some beautiful plants in there. They're not very big now
[02:53.190 --> 02:58.350]  But by the end of the season, they will be monstrous and they will be filled with a lot of magnificent seeds
[02:58.510 --> 03:04.870]  So here's a big tease stay tuned for future episodes. I will talk a lot about the greenhouse and the progress
[03:05.510 --> 03:10.970]  Over time I will reveal the plants that are in there maybe in the very near future
[03:10.970 --> 03:14.750]  I will tell you what male plant I have put in there because that will make a big difference
[03:14.750 --> 03:20.890]  It's not a male plant that you're used to me using often. So I've already said too much. Let's jump into this email
[03:20.890 --> 03:24.910]  I did say I was going to answer an email from a friend. I'm not playing with my phone here
[03:24.950 --> 03:28.930]  This message is on my phone screen. Let me find it
[03:28.930 --> 03:32.010]  I did have it right here. But then of course, you know, the iPhone does that thing?
[03:32.010 --> 03:35.370]  It goes a lot like this it says I've got a question
[03:35.370 --> 03:41.450]  It says what's up Ross to Jeff at what point would you recommend someone throw in the towel on growing?
[03:41.490 --> 03:45.450]  It sounds like our friend is having a frustrating time in the grow room, but it goes on
[03:45.450 --> 03:51.450]  It says I've been growing for half of my life. And honestly, I'm unable to produce anything that makes me proud
[03:51.450 --> 03:53.450]  I'm embarrassed if anything
[03:54.170 --> 03:57.530]  That's got to be a frustrating position to be in and I'm sure that together
[03:57.970 --> 04:00.650]  With a little bit of patience a little bit of work. We can definitely
[04:01.370 --> 04:04.290]  Improve your garden it will take patience and time and some effort
[04:04.290 --> 04:09.190]  But I've got some ideas some steps some plans a solution to help you improve the grow
[04:09.690 --> 04:16.290]  It says the next grow I've been saying for 18 years that the next grow is going to be the one at what point is it?
[04:16.290 --> 04:24.090]  Insane to keep repeating the same failure again and again to produce mids every time then they give their name and they say
[04:24.410 --> 04:26.650]  Sincerely, thank you, bro. Thank you for the great message
[04:26.650 --> 04:28.790]  I don't know if this was meant to be for the show
[04:28.790 --> 04:30.510]  But you've sent me a lot of great content
[04:30.510 --> 04:35.630]  This was my first favorite message that I wanted to use on the show keep sending me the great content
[04:35.630 --> 04:36.870]  You do have a lot of great ideas
[04:36.870 --> 04:40.790]  This one is going to go straight to the show the part that got my attention here
[04:40.910 --> 04:45.350]  Was at what point is it insane to keep repeating the same failure again and again?
[04:46.110 --> 04:49.070]  Repeating the same failure again and again is insane once or twice
[04:49.070 --> 04:52.070]  I'll give you like I got to try it again. Maybe it was a fluke try it again
[04:52.070 --> 04:54.070]  You notice some shits wrong if you do it a third time
[04:54.070 --> 04:57.390]  That's when I'm gonna start saying that you got some issues what we need to do
[04:57.910 --> 05:03.550]  Is not keep doing the same thing over and over it sounds like you've been doing the same thing for 18 years and it's not
[05:03.550 --> 05:09.110]  Working now is the time to assess the situation see what is working see what is not working
[05:09.110 --> 05:12.050]  I do have a list of stuff here on my computer screen that I'm gonna get to
[05:12.590 --> 05:14.310]  I
[05:14.310 --> 05:19.030]  Think it is time to find the weakness. Where is your weak point? What are you not doing?
[05:19.030 --> 05:22.550]  What are you not really good at where is it going wrong at what point in the grow?
[05:22.550 --> 05:26.730]  Are you noticing that things are not up to your expectations if you're looking?
[05:27.410 --> 05:34.370]  Maybe it's not really good to compare your grow to other grows on social media your friends grows on the discord server
[05:34.610 --> 05:41.170]  But at the same time a lot of people are watching their friends grow their grommies grow on social media
[05:41.170 --> 05:47.270]  They're saying I'm at week for a veg and my plants look like this if yours are much smaller much more spindly less healthy
[05:47.370 --> 05:50.450]  Maybe there's something you're lacking that other person is doing
[05:50.450 --> 05:56.390]  Then when we get into flower if we're comparing our plants and we see that this guy's way further along and has bigger juicier buds
[05:56.390 --> 06:00.030]  And we're just getting bud set. Maybe we can see that. We're not up to the standard
[06:00.030 --> 06:06.150]  Maybe we could be but don't make it a too much of a habit to compare yourself to others for your success
[06:06.150 --> 06:09.830]  It is a good guideline to kind of see what others are doing and you can see if you're keeping up
[06:09.830 --> 06:15.790]  But don't make it the template don't make it the expectation, but it's a good way to see where do you fall off?
[06:16.430 --> 06:18.830]  Do your plants look like your friends your partners?
[06:19.110 --> 06:23.190]  The communities grow at week to a veg week three week four week five
[06:23.230 --> 06:26.550]  How about week six that they looked at the same then when you go into flower
[06:26.630 --> 06:30.910]  When do they stop looking good to you? When do you see the problem happening?
[06:30.910 --> 06:34.030]  So let's find the weakness that we are lacking
[06:34.470 --> 06:36.470]  You might already know where you're lacking
[06:36.470 --> 06:42.030]  You may already be able to identify the problem the time frame about this time frame things start going wrong
[06:42.030 --> 06:45.750]  And I'm not as happy as I could be maybe you already know that but let's pay attention
[06:46.350 --> 06:49.190]  Let's do another cycle and take a lot of notes
[06:50.030 --> 06:56.590]  Let's build a standard operating procedure. Let's build a process. Let's develop a streamlined flow
[06:56.790 --> 07:02.150]  Let's have a reason and a purpose for everything that we are doing in that grow and while we are doing it
[07:02.190 --> 07:08.350]  Let's document it. Let's take notes. Let's make documentation so that we know what we are doing. So if we have a great outcome
[07:09.110 --> 07:14.030]  We've got an SOP. We've got a standard operating procedure of what to repeat if we get a terrible outcome
[07:14.230 --> 07:18.910]  We've got an SOP of what not to do and we can look at that and say well this shit didn't work and you've got
[07:18.910 --> 07:20.910]  Some sort of a map some sort of data
[07:20.910 --> 07:22.470]  I don't know if you're doing that right now
[07:22.470 --> 07:26.510]  But that would be one of the things I really recommend is start taking a lot of notes
[07:26.630 --> 07:30.070]  So find the weakness in your grow. Is it a process?
[07:30.070 --> 07:34.550]  Is it a system that you are doing or is it simply a product or a piece of equipment?
[07:35.030 --> 07:41.350]  Without really good lighting your plants are never going to be the top quality plants that they could be you've got to get either
[07:41.350 --> 07:43.990]  I there are so many options available for lighting
[07:43.990 --> 07:48.350]  I'm not even gonna talk about it get the best light that your money can afford for your situation
[07:48.350 --> 07:52.910]  There are a lot of options when it comes to lighting if you got a high ceiling get a more powerful light if you got
[07:52.910 --> 07:56.750]  A low ceiling get more low power lights and spread them out a little bit
[07:56.750 --> 08:02.230]  You have a lot of options get the best light you can afford then air. How is the airflow in your grow?
[08:02.230 --> 08:06.710]  Are you exchanging air you getting fresh air in there? Is there air movement? How's the temperature?
[08:06.710 --> 08:10.670]  How's the humidity or is the air dialed in so you got the lights? We got the air
[08:10.670 --> 08:16.230]  How's the water as you are you giving them good water which includes nutrients? What are you feeding these plants?
[08:16.230 --> 08:21.590]  Are you buying the bottom of the barrel cheapest shit you can get and feeding it very little so you can get by or you?
[08:21.590 --> 08:26.950]  Buying the best shit that money can buy and maximizing it pushing those plants to their full potential. That's up to you
[08:26.950 --> 08:33.590]  So we got lights get the best lights get the air fixed get air flow get the temperature get the humidity get some wind
[08:33.590 --> 08:36.530]  Don't have any micro climates get all that stuff dialed in your water
[08:37.030 --> 08:41.710]  Do you have the right nutrients the right amount of nutrients at the right time is your pH correct?
[08:42.390 --> 08:45.990]  Lights air water, how about your soil? What are you growing in?
[08:45.990 --> 08:52.950]  Are you using cocoa using soil soilless mix are you growing in straight clay pebbles? Are you going in rockwool cubes?
[08:53.070 --> 08:56.650]  What are you doing there is that dialed in are you over watering?
[08:56.650 --> 09:02.430]  Are you underwatering is your pH right as your soil drying up too much as your soil staying too wet?
[09:02.430 --> 09:06.470]  Are your rockwool cubes getting moldy? There are so many things to think about there
[09:06.910 --> 09:11.950]  So let's get the basics dialed in the lights the air the water the soil the next thing
[09:11.950 --> 09:14.030]  I'm gonna talk about of course is a seed breeder is
[09:14.470 --> 09:21.910]  Genetics have you been growing a genetic that does not have a quality potential some plants will only get so good other plants will get
[09:21.910 --> 09:26.650]  So good, it's all about the genetics, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a seed breeder
[09:26.650 --> 09:31.390]  I'm not the only breeder out there making amazing genetics. There are a lot of great genetics
[09:31.630 --> 09:34.990]  Maybe it's time to spend a few bucks and get some better genetics
[09:35.110 --> 09:40.430]  Maybe you need a better light. Maybe you need better airflow. Maybe you need a better air setup. Maybe you need better water
[09:40.430 --> 09:43.390]  Maybe you need a better medium. Maybe you need better genetics
[09:43.470 --> 09:49.310]  Then if all of that stuff is dialed in that's when we start talking about the actual process of the grow
[09:49.590 --> 09:52.530]  Even if you've got the best race car on the planet
[09:52.530 --> 09:56.910]  You can't win the race if you don't know how to grow if you don't even know how to turn on the engine and shift
[09:56.910 --> 09:59.230]  That bitch into gear you're not getting off the starting line
[09:59.710 --> 10:04.630]  So let's start with the best equipment we can get then let's get a very good grow
[10:04.910 --> 10:11.350]  Procedure down by this time you've been growing for 18 years. You should have a decent understanding of this plant you understand
[10:11.710 --> 10:16.830]  How to cut clones the veg cycle the flowering cycle you should have a good understanding of the basics
[10:16.830 --> 10:21.270]  I would almost run a crop the way that you do it and take a lot of notes
[10:21.390 --> 10:27.110]  Then look at it and see where did it go wrong? Where do you notice the plants aren't performing up to your expectation?
[10:27.550 --> 10:32.190]  Then just like anything in life identify the problem and then think of a solution
[10:32.190 --> 10:37.830]  How can we improve and correct this problem? How can we solve this? What is the solution? How do we move forward?
[10:37.950 --> 10:45.750]  So identify the weakness identify the problem then let's find a way to improve upon that. Are you so I'm gonna ramble
[10:45.750 --> 10:50.190]  I've got a couple of different thought processes and patterns. I want to go down here first off
[10:50.190 --> 10:54.430]  Are your mother plants healthy? Are you starting off with healthy mother stock?
[10:54.550 --> 11:00.590]  Then do you know how to take healthy clones those are two thought processes are the plants healthy that you're beginning with
[11:00.710 --> 11:05.470]  Then do you know how to create healthy clones? Do you know how to create healthy veg plants?
[11:05.470 --> 11:10.790]  Do you know how to transition those healthy veg plants into flower? Do you know how to keep pests and pathogens away?
[11:10.830 --> 11:13.390]  Do you know how to optimize the room?
[11:13.390 --> 11:17.870]  Do you know how to dial in the space learn how to treat that plant exactly how it needs to be treated?
[11:18.550 --> 11:20.550]  Maybe learn a little bit more about identifying
[11:21.470 --> 11:27.390]  Deficiencies and overfeeding and under watering and temperature issues start identifying what the plant is telling you
[11:27.710 --> 11:29.390]  We rely a lot on
[11:29.390 --> 11:34.750]  Equipment a lot of times the plant will be sitting right over there in the grow room and we will be staring at the computer
[11:34.790 --> 11:41.310]  Going well, the VPD looks good. The pH of the water looks good. This fan is working. Everything is good in the computer
[11:42.150 --> 11:44.190]  But the plants are over there telling you something's wrong
[11:44.190 --> 11:45.590]  We forget to look at the plants
[11:45.590 --> 11:51.590]  So learn to look at the plants and read those plants see what the plants are telling you the plants have all of the answers
[11:51.750 --> 11:57.850]  We rely so much on meters and computers and toys and gadgets. I didn't have all that stuff when we started
[11:57.850 --> 11:58.950]  It sounds like I'm a dinosaur
[11:58.950 --> 12:05.470]  But I haven't been growing for that long the evolution of growing technology with legalization has made it super easy
[12:05.470 --> 12:08.830]  All the tools all the toys all the tips and tricks are already available
[12:09.230 --> 12:14.230]  When I started I couldn't just get on the internet and I couldn't just call somebody because it was kind of secretive
[12:14.230 --> 12:17.150]  We would have gone to jail if I told too many damn people about the grow
[12:17.150 --> 12:23.550]  I had to watch the plants and figure out what they were telling me. So learn to watch those plants develop a
[12:23.910 --> 12:30.070]  One thing we're forgetting about also is the relationship with the plants the computers the toys the gadgets the devices
[12:30.070 --> 12:33.190]  They've kind of removed us from the plant. We're looking into the screen
[12:33.710 --> 12:35.550]  But there's a lot of cool shit there
[12:35.550 --> 12:41.190]  But everything we need to know is over there on the plant go sit by the plant go touch the plant go smell it go
[12:41.190 --> 12:46.910]  Observe it you're gonna notice more looking at the plants than you ever will the screen if you can't figure it out by looking at
[12:46.910 --> 12:49.230]  The plant look at the screen then put the math together
[12:49.230 --> 12:53.770]  It'll give you a hint but definitely focus more on the plants a lot of people say hey
[12:53.770 --> 12:57.110]  My runoff numbers are looking good or this number doesn't look good on the meter
[12:57.230 --> 13:01.530]  What can I do and my response is how did the plants look dude are the plants?
[13:01.530 --> 13:05.350]  Okay, and they go yeah, the plants look great, but my numbers are bad and I say I don't care
[13:05.350 --> 13:09.910]  The meters don't matter. I am NOT growing pH meters and EC meters and that doesn't matter
[13:09.910 --> 13:13.070]  I want to know what the plants look like I'm growing plants. That's what really matters
[13:13.070 --> 13:16.670]  So I got off on a ramble there, but learn the plants learn to identify
[13:17.750 --> 13:22.750]  Deficiencies over feeding under feeding over watering under watering heat stress cold stress
[13:23.270 --> 13:26.350]  Have you ever thought that you can just reach over and touch a plant?
[13:26.430 --> 13:29.910]  Just like mom used to do when you're a little or you dad used to do like you need a jacket
[13:29.910 --> 13:33.070]  You're like no, I'm fine. And they just reach down to touch you like no, you're cold. You need a jacket
[13:33.070 --> 13:38.710]  They'd give you a jacket. You can reach out and touch your plants. They are yours touch them feel them. Are they cold?
[13:38.750 --> 13:42.950]  Do they feel slimy because they're so humid. How do they feel touch them learn them?
[13:42.990 --> 13:44.030]  so I
[13:44.030 --> 13:50.150]  would run a full cycle and I would take a lot of notes and pay a lot of attention start from the very beginning and
[13:50.270 --> 13:54.870]  Build a process take notes and observe then here's what I want you to think about
[13:55.750 --> 14:01.230]  Why are you doing everything you're doing? What is the purpose for everything you were doing?
[14:01.230 --> 14:05.670]  There's got to be a rhyme or a reason for what you were doing to those plants
[14:05.670 --> 14:13.350]  Then also think about what are you not doing? Are you popping and twisting? Are you lollipopping? Are you defoliating? Are you?
[14:14.310 --> 14:19.990]  Perfecting the pH. Are you dialing in the EC? Are you making sure that the VPD in the room is correct?
[14:19.990 --> 14:22.830]  What are you not doing that? You should be doing
[14:22.830 --> 14:28.750]  So think about what you are doing and make sure that every move everything you do has a purpose. Why is
[14:29.270 --> 14:33.590]  It's something that you learned from some random dude 20 years ago
[14:33.590 --> 14:38.310]  That is you don't even need to be doing that anymore. Stop doing that. That's wasting your time or messing up the crop
[14:38.510 --> 14:43.150]  Why are you doing everything you were doing? And then why are you not doing a lot of the things?
[14:43.150 --> 14:48.310]  You know, you should be doing there are things you skip and I know that we all do that sort of stuff
[14:48.470 --> 14:56.070]  So when are it now while you're doing all these things notice also when your plants stop living up to your expectations and take notes
[14:56.470 --> 14:58.470]  It probably happened
[14:58.470 --> 15:04.390]  7 10 maybe 14 days from when you see the turn that's probably where you fucked up
[15:04.390 --> 15:07.830]  So if you're taking a lot of notes, we can go back in all those notes
[15:08.070 --> 15:12.510]  Write down when you go into the grow you should start taking documents from like
[15:13.270 --> 15:19.470]  901 a.m. Open to the door 905 fed the plants this and write down exactly what you fed
[15:19.710 --> 15:24.150]  write down the pH and the EC and the PPMs of what you fed then
[15:24.630 --> 15:29.030]  Collect some of the runoff and write down what the runoff was and I just said that those numbers don't matter
[15:29.030 --> 15:32.510]  But they will help us diagnose a problem because you're trying to improve
[15:32.950 --> 15:36.110]  So feed the plants write down what time you fed them how much?
[15:36.550 --> 15:42.710]  EC pH PPM get all the data you can of the solution going in and coming out of those plants
[15:43.070 --> 15:47.710]  If you do any defoliation if you do any popping twisting lollipopping
[15:47.870 --> 15:53.030]  Write it down if you don't do anything write it down if you notice some weird shit
[15:53.150 --> 15:59.430]  Write it down. If any of your equipment does anything weird write it down that way. We've got a record
[15:59.430 --> 16:04.810]  We've got some sort of a job record that was some data that way we can look back and see what the hell is going
[16:04.810 --> 16:07.590]  On and you're growing we can see where to am
[16:08.110 --> 16:14.750]  Prove I said improve kind of weirdly there, but let's make a record. Let's make an SOP. Let's make a standard operating procedure
[16:14.750 --> 16:17.410]  Let's make a flow. Let's use quality products
[16:17.410 --> 16:22.830]  It's lose quality genetics then have a goal when you start noticing your plants aren't reaching the expectations
[16:23.070 --> 16:27.710]  Then we can look at the plants how they are and we can look back a couple of weeks ago and say well we should
[16:27.710 --> 16:32.030]  Have done this we didn't do this or we should not have done this if you're spraying anything
[16:32.430 --> 16:37.910]  Definitely write that down a lot of sprays could have adverse reactions to your garden. Maybe it's a nutrient thing
[16:37.910 --> 16:40.790]  Maybe it's something you're doing but take good notes
[16:40.790 --> 16:43.610]  So when you get to the point when you notice it's not where you want it to be
[16:43.750 --> 16:47.430]  Send me some pictures and we can talk about it together and I'll help you get it dialed in
[16:47.510 --> 16:49.510]  So think about really intently
[16:49.590 --> 16:56.030]  Why are you doing what you're doing in the grow is everything you're doing purpose or is it ritual and if it's purposeful
[16:56.030 --> 16:59.070]  Where did you learn it? Is it something that has been tried and true?
[16:59.070 --> 17:04.110]  Is it been proven or is it just a move that actually could be diminishing your results?
[17:04.110 --> 17:05.390]  Could it be messing up the outcome?
[17:05.390 --> 17:10.110]  Could it be a complete waste of time and money or could it be greatly improving your product?
[17:10.110 --> 17:15.150]  Think about that every time you make a move in the grow if it's just ritual. Let's get rid of it
[17:15.150 --> 17:19.630]  Sometimes people have to do weird ritual shit if it's a waste of time stop doing it
[17:19.630 --> 17:22.330]  If it's something that keeps your OCD under control, I get it
[17:22.330 --> 17:25.230]  but let's minimize the weird shit we do in the grow just because
[17:25.430 --> 17:30.290]  Our uncle taught us to do that seven years ago and we've been doing it ever since you've been doing it wrong
[17:30.290 --> 17:32.290]  Maybe for seven years, bro
[17:32.630 --> 17:35.830]  When it comes to growing there are a lot of things to dial in
[17:35.830 --> 17:41.350]  We've got a lot of equipment to think about we've got a lot of feeding to think about there's a lot of technique to think
[17:41.350 --> 17:46.510]  About of course genetics make a big role. I make a big part in this whole the whole chessboard here
[17:46.510 --> 17:48.190]  Is what I like to call it
[17:48.190 --> 17:54.990]  There are a lot of things to dial in don't focus on dialing in everything all at one time. Let's go baby steps
[17:54.990 --> 18:00.450]  Let's identify a couple of small problems make a few small changes because if you make a bunch of big changes
[18:00.450 --> 18:04.650]  How do you know what worked what didn't work? Let's make one or two changes at a time
[18:04.910 --> 18:09.870]  You've been growing for 18 years and you're frustrated if we get you a little bit better over the next couple of years
[18:09.870 --> 18:15.670]  We will see improvement. You'll see progress. Hopefully you feel encouragement. You've already got all the stuff you've been at it
[18:15.670 --> 18:20.310]  Let's get you improved. Let's get you going. Your question was how long do I go until I throw in the towel?
[18:20.910 --> 18:25.370]  The main thing is that we identify the issue and make some corrections and make some changes
[18:25.370 --> 18:29.350]  I don't know that you had the right guidance and the right idea to make those corrections and changes
[18:29.350 --> 18:31.350]  So hopefully I can help you out
[18:31.710 --> 18:35.510]  There are a lot of things to think about and dial in so make small changes one step at a time
[18:35.790 --> 18:41.770]  Don't change too many things and do everything I keep saying this do and this goes to everybody growing out there
[18:41.770 --> 18:48.890]  Do everything in your garden with intent and purpose? Why are you doing that? If I go? Why did you do that?
[18:48.890 --> 18:49.970]  You should have a good reason
[18:49.970 --> 18:50.670]  it shouldn't just be oh
[18:50.670 --> 18:57.110]  I don't know or just because it should be I did that because of this and there should be a solid answer and a reason
[18:57.110 --> 19:01.150]  Think about that while you're in the grow think about that while you're mixing nutrients cutting clones
[19:01.950 --> 19:08.950]  Defoliating a lollipopping topping popping twisting putting up the trellis think about why am I doing this the way that I am doing it?
[19:08.950 --> 19:10.950]  What would Rasta Jeff do in this situation?
[19:11.630 --> 19:18.750]  Maybe you're doing some silly shit that is wasting time causing problems and minimizing your potential for success
[19:18.750 --> 19:24.190]  I don't want anybody to quit growing out there. So if you're planning on quitting if you're getting frustrated, please send me a message
[19:24.190 --> 19:25.670]  Let me know what's frustrating you
[19:25.670 --> 19:29.230]  Let me know where you're stuck and I will do my best to get your message here on the show
[19:29.310 --> 19:32.350]  We will get your grow up to speed we will get you over the hump
[19:32.350 --> 19:34.670]  We will get you up in the winning team
[19:34.790 --> 19:40.710]  My goal is to have everybody out there growing the best cannabis that they can grow
[19:40.710 --> 19:46.750]  I want everybody out there to feel like they've got cup winning cannabis and I want all your friends to think that you've got
[19:46.790 --> 19:49.550]  Better cannabis than them. It's the best feeling when you're like, bro
[19:49.550 --> 19:52.810]  I grew some good weed, but that weed that you grew is a little bit better than mine
[19:52.810 --> 19:54.310]  I want to get that good at it
[19:54.310 --> 19:58.190]  I want everybody to be striving to be the best and reaching that goal of having
[19:58.750 --> 20:04.830]  Quality cannabis everywhere we go that way every concert I go to every comedy show I go to every gathering
[20:04.830 --> 20:08.910]  I go to somebody pulls out weed and I can go that's gonna be good weed because we've been spreading the word
[20:08.990 --> 20:10.830]  Teaching the gospel all over the place
[20:10.830 --> 20:15.550]  So I want you guys to all be as good of a grower as I am if not a better grower than me
[20:15.550 --> 20:20.510]  That's that's how you see true progress when the when the next iteration does better than the previous
[20:20.510 --> 20:23.790]  that's my goal here teach you guys to be and gals and
[20:24.190 --> 20:30.190]  Everything in between and both to be the best growers that you possibly can be. All right, my dude
[20:30.190 --> 20:33.430]  I don't need to say your name on the air because I just read that you're thinking about giving up
[20:33.430 --> 20:38.710]  I don't want to embarrass you. I'm only here to encourage you. Please feel supported and encouraged
[20:38.710 --> 20:42.670]  I want you to keep growing if you feel that you are limited by genetics. I know who you are
[20:42.870 --> 20:46.190]  You've sent me a lot of emails, which is cool, bro
[20:46.190 --> 20:51.190]  But keep them coming but bro settle down but also keep them coming cuz I like them but holy shit, dude
[20:51.190 --> 20:55.990]  You send me a lot of emails if you need a pack of seeds because you don't feel like your genetics are
[20:56.310 --> 20:57.990]  Reaching your potential. Let me know
[20:57.990 --> 21:03.390]  I'd be happy to give you some fresh high quality beans get you going you can do a pheno hunt find the phenotype that works
[21:03.390 --> 21:08.750]  Best for you then grow that one to perfection build a relationship build a system with that plant
[21:08.870 --> 21:12.710]  Maybe possibly the genetics are you're a limiting factor
[21:12.950 --> 21:21.030]  Everybody else out there ladies gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers new growers pro growers
[21:22.110 --> 21:23.670]  Frustrated growers and cup winners
[21:23.670 --> 21:27.590]  I want to thank all of you for listening to another episode of the grow from your heart podcast
