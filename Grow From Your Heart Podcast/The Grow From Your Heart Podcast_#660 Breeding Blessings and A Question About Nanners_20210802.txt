[00:03.260 --> 00:20.370]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:20.370 --> 00:26.690]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 660 of the Grow From Your
[00:26.690 --> 00:28.310]  Heart podcast.
[00:28.310 --> 00:31.390]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions.
[00:31.390 --> 00:35.330]  Before we get to those grow questions, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:35.410 --> 00:37.870]  who support the show on Patreon.
[00:37.870 --> 00:41.510]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:41.510 --> 00:42.510]  Scooters3G.
[00:42.510 --> 00:45.070]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Jessica Kay.
[00:45.070 --> 00:47.110]  I want to send a thank you to Dank Grows.
[00:47.110 --> 00:51.190]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my friend Crazy Hand Grows.
[00:51.190 --> 00:53.870]  Let's send a thank you shout out to my new friend Justin Klosser.
[00:53.870 --> 00:57.390]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Elders Garden and Stoner Dave.
[00:57.390 --> 01:01.150]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to 716 Vibes and James Butterson.
[01:01.150 --> 01:04.830]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to my friend The Painted Lady.
[01:05.330 --> 01:09.050]  And let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[01:09.050 --> 01:11.230]  my friend Chicago Dabber.
[01:11.230 --> 01:16.150]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:16.150 --> 01:19.790]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:19.790 --> 01:26.050]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:26.050 --> 01:28.430]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:28.430 --> 01:32.870]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:32.870 --> 01:35.890]  it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:35.890 --> 01:39.070]  If you've been watching the past couple of episodes, you know this is the part of the
[01:39.070 --> 01:42.530]  show where I invite you to join us on the Discord channel.
[01:42.530 --> 01:46.830]  That's right, there's an iRi Army Discord where all of the iRi Genetics crew, the Grow
[01:46.830 --> 01:51.110]  From Your Heart podcast crew are hanging out on the Discord right now.
[01:51.110 --> 01:52.790]  There's a live chat happening.
[01:52.790 --> 01:54.390]  Somebody's posting pictures.
[01:54.390 --> 01:58.130]  Dave's doing an auction or a raffle or something of that nature up there.
[01:58.130 --> 01:59.470]  Join us on the Discord channel.
[01:59.470 --> 02:03.190]  There is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:03.190 --> 02:04.910]  All right.
[02:04.910 --> 02:09.830]  I do want to start the show by saying that a few of my friends have mentioned something
[02:09.830 --> 02:11.150]  that I think is funny.
[02:11.150 --> 02:17.030]  I have decided that when you overflow the reservoir at a new grow, you have simply baptized
[02:17.030 --> 02:18.790]  the place with your new presence.
[02:18.790 --> 02:20.650]  That is now your new grow.
[02:20.650 --> 02:24.270]  It's like I licked it, it's mine, or I peed on it, it is mine.
[02:24.270 --> 02:27.510]  That is what happens when you overflow the reservoir at a grow.
[02:27.550 --> 02:29.790]  The first time you do it, that is your new place.
[02:29.790 --> 02:32.990]  The second time you do it, we got to figure out an excuse for that.
[02:32.990 --> 02:36.750]  The third time, set a fucking timer and quit taking so many dabs on your break.
[02:36.750 --> 02:40.910]  But the first time you overflowed that reservoir, welcome to your new grow.
[02:40.910 --> 02:42.190]  That is a christening.
[02:42.190 --> 02:43.270]  That is a rite of passage.
[02:43.270 --> 02:45.150]  It's funny the first time.
[02:45.150 --> 02:48.630]  It's a real bitch the second time, but the third time it gets embarrassing.
[02:48.630 --> 02:52.470]  I wanted to give a shout out to a friend who overflowed his reservoir.
[02:52.470 --> 02:55.530]  You're not going to get your name said, but bro, big shout out, much respect.
[02:55.530 --> 02:56.530]  Welcome to the crew.
[02:56.550 --> 02:57.550]  I've done it.
[02:57.550 --> 02:59.810]  It's going to happen again.
[02:59.810 --> 03:00.810]  Overflow gang.
[03:00.810 --> 03:01.810]  All right.
[03:01.810 --> 03:02.810]  Where do I go from there?
[03:02.810 --> 03:04.010]  I've got a good question.
[03:04.010 --> 03:08.010]  Many people might not be aware, but I am not only the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:08.010 --> 03:12.690]  Not only do they know me as RossDeJeff, but also I am the head breeder, the only breeder,
[03:12.690 --> 03:16.530]  the founder, sole proprietor of Iry Genetics Premium Seeds.
[03:16.530 --> 03:17.530]  That's right.
[03:17.530 --> 03:18.610]  I make Iry Genetics Premium Seeds.
[03:18.610 --> 03:19.890]  That is all me.
[03:19.890 --> 03:22.170]  I do have a nice test crew that helps me out.
[03:22.170 --> 03:28.090]  I do have some friends helping me with the project this summer, but 99.99% of Iry Genetics
[03:28.090 --> 03:29.250]  is all me.
[03:29.250 --> 03:30.250]  There's a web guy.
[03:30.250 --> 03:31.250]  Shout out to the web guy.
[03:31.250 --> 03:35.690]  Shout out to the testing crew, but the breeding, the selection, all of that stuff happens by
[03:35.690 --> 03:37.090]  me.
[03:37.090 --> 03:40.830]  I do offer a product called Table Seeds.
[03:40.830 --> 03:42.570]  They're not available on a website or anything.
[03:42.570 --> 03:47.370]  If you get seeds through some avenues, through some auctions or some raffles or perhaps a
[03:47.370 --> 03:51.930]  waffle, they do offer Table Seeds as a bonus.
[03:51.970 --> 03:56.410]  Let me take a moment to describe what Table Seeds are before we get into this message.
[03:56.410 --> 03:59.410]  Table Seeds are just exactly what they sound like.
[03:59.410 --> 04:03.370]  Let's say hypothetically I was sitting at this table and I was packing up a bunch of
[04:03.370 --> 04:09.090]  seed packages and I put a package of whatever seeds into a bowl and then I disperse those
[04:09.090 --> 04:13.010]  seeds from a bowl into 10 packs or into five packs.
[04:13.010 --> 04:17.330]  Sometimes when I'm done, as I'm cleaning up, I discover seeds on the table.
[04:17.330 --> 04:18.690]  Guess what those get labeled?
[04:18.690 --> 04:22.370]  Those are now what are known as Table Seeds, unknown soldiers.
[04:22.370 --> 04:25.930]  If I've worked with a couple of strains over the course of the day and we clean up at the
[04:25.930 --> 04:30.250]  end of the day, I may find 10 or 12 seeds and I don't know which bag they came from.
[04:30.250 --> 04:31.490]  I do not give them a name.
[04:31.490 --> 04:32.490]  I'm not that kind of guy.
[04:32.490 --> 04:34.370]  I don't just assign them a name.
[04:34.370 --> 04:36.570]  I don't just pick a bag for them to go into.
[04:36.570 --> 04:38.330]  I don't just fake it for you.
[04:38.330 --> 04:39.730]  I actually set them aside.
[04:39.730 --> 04:43.250]  They go into another bowl that is labeled Table Seeds.
[04:43.250 --> 04:45.490]  Just all the random seeds I clean up off the table.
[04:45.490 --> 04:47.890]  Maybe I found it tucked under the side of the computer.
[04:47.890 --> 04:49.770]  Maybe it rolled off that way.
[04:49.770 --> 04:51.890]  Maybe I just don't know which bag it came out of.
[04:51.890 --> 04:54.810]  Instead of trying to fake it, like I said earlier, I don't lie to you.
[04:54.810 --> 04:55.810]  I don't cheat you.
[04:55.810 --> 04:56.810]  I don't rip you off.
[04:56.810 --> 04:58.410]  It gets assigned the word Table Seeds.
[04:58.410 --> 05:02.490]  Then when you buy seeds at a waffle or an action, yes, we do be careful with some of
[05:02.490 --> 05:03.490]  the words we say.
[05:03.490 --> 05:04.890]  It's just jokes there.
[05:04.890 --> 05:09.650]  When you do buy stuff in a waffle or an action, I do send you extra Table Seeds as a bonus,
[05:09.650 --> 05:10.650]  as a thank you.
[05:10.650 --> 05:12.810]  That's just my way of giving you more shit.
[05:12.810 --> 05:17.250]  You do get bonus packs every time you shop with me, but I will send you extra Table Seeds
[05:17.330 --> 05:18.330]  if I've got them.
[05:18.330 --> 05:21.010]  They're low right now, so I stopped doing it.
[05:21.010 --> 05:24.290]  Once they pile back up and I've got more to make it worth our time and energy, I will
[05:24.290 --> 05:26.890]  put the Table Seeds back in the mix.
[05:26.890 --> 05:29.490]  Now that you know what Table Seeds are, oh, the beauty about Table Seeds.
[05:29.490 --> 05:32.670]  Let's talk about how magical Table Seeds are.
[05:32.670 --> 05:35.690]  They could be anything in my lineup.
[05:35.690 --> 05:37.850]  It could be anything I've ever released.
[05:37.850 --> 05:39.850]  It could be anything I've never released.
[05:39.850 --> 05:42.330]  It could be stuff you've heard of a thousand times.
[05:42.330 --> 05:44.250]  It could be shit you have never heard of.
[05:44.250 --> 05:48.250]  Anything, any seed that has ever crossed this table has the potential to end up as
[05:48.250 --> 05:49.690]  a Table Seed.
[05:49.690 --> 05:56.890]  If I've got a Congo to Arise or Jack the Ripper to, ooh, let's not say too many things, right?
[05:56.890 --> 05:58.770]  Jack the Ripper to Lemon Skunk.
[05:58.770 --> 06:02.290]  Maybe I dropped one of those seeds and it rolled off somewhere and I found it later.
[06:02.290 --> 06:04.570]  That's in the Table Seed mix, and I don't even know what it is.
[06:04.570 --> 06:05.570]  They could be regs.
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.570]  They could be fems.
[06:06.570 --> 06:09.890]  It's kind of iRegenetics bag seed is close to what that is.
[06:09.890 --> 06:14.690]  You know it's from me, but you don't know which male or female was involved in that
[06:14.690 --> 06:16.170]  mix in any way.
[06:16.170 --> 06:17.170]  Those are Table Seeds.
[06:17.170 --> 06:19.330]  They could be anything from my lineup.
[06:19.330 --> 06:21.090]  It could be a Feminize cross.
[06:21.090 --> 06:22.930]  It could be a King Solomon cross.
[06:22.930 --> 06:24.770]  It could be a Jack the Ripper cross.
[06:24.770 --> 06:26.490]  It could be an old Daybreaker cross.
[06:26.490 --> 06:28.650]  It could be a King Kim Grape Stomper cross.
[06:28.650 --> 06:30.930]  It could be anything out of my lineup.
[06:30.930 --> 06:33.270]  I think I made enough stress on that.
[06:33.270 --> 06:36.390]  This question stems from the Table Seeds.
[06:36.390 --> 06:39.210]  This one came from our friend, Grocan Advocate.
[06:39.210 --> 06:42.490]  It looks like this one came over Patreon, I do think.
[06:42.490 --> 06:44.650]  Big thank you for the Patreon support.
[06:44.650 --> 06:45.650]  It does go on.
[06:45.650 --> 06:49.310]  It says, Rasta Jeff, I can't thank you enough for the wisdom you impart to the cannabis
[06:49.310 --> 06:52.830]  community through your videos and podcasts.
[06:52.830 --> 06:53.830]  Thank you.
[06:53.830 --> 06:57.450]  Those compliments, those words of encouragement mean a lot to me, so thank you.
[06:57.450 --> 07:00.890]  It says, we are a better community because of you.
[07:00.890 --> 07:04.830]  I don't know that I'm making a better community, but if you say so, that's humbling.
[07:04.830 --> 07:05.830]  That is awesome.
[07:05.830 --> 07:08.850]  I'm going to politely take the compliment, but I don't know that I made.
[07:08.890 --> 07:10.250]  I think I did make the whole community better.
[07:10.250 --> 07:12.370]  There's a really cool, chill vibe in the Discord.
[07:12.370 --> 07:14.290]  So go hang out and go see the community we did create.
[07:14.290 --> 07:15.290]  You're right, bro.
[07:15.290 --> 07:16.290]  I'll quit fighting with you.
[07:16.290 --> 07:17.290]  It goes on, though.
[07:17.290 --> 07:18.790]  It says, here is my question.
[07:18.790 --> 07:22.330]  As a Patreon supporter, I've tried to hang out on the Discord channel and learn from
[07:22.330 --> 07:26.850]  all of the fine folks in the Irie Army, and I've even had the chance to win one of the
[07:26.850 --> 07:28.930]  seed auctions a few months back.
[07:28.930 --> 07:33.370]  Yes, allegedly, possibly, there may be some seed auctions over on the Discord.
[07:33.370 --> 07:37.350]  We got to be careful what we say on YouTube, but allegedly that could be a thing.
[07:37.350 --> 07:41.710]  It says, I'm currently growing Irie Genetics Blue Raspberry Truffle, and in the package,
[07:41.710 --> 07:48.030]  I got a handful of 10 or 15 or 20 table seeds, which is funny because they come in packs
[07:48.030 --> 07:52.950]  of 10, and you got 15 or 20, which means I was generous with your table seeds.
[07:52.950 --> 07:55.070]  I just like to give you extra shit.
[07:55.070 --> 07:59.670]  Money is expensive, and when you guys choose to spend your hard-earned money, especially
[07:59.670 --> 08:03.870]  during the past year and a half, two years we've had, when we're not absolutely sure
[08:03.870 --> 08:07.750]  where the next nickel and dime could come from, money is extra expensive, and when you
[08:07.750 --> 08:13.550]  chose to spend your hard-earned money, your scarce money, with my company on my brand,
[08:13.550 --> 08:18.310]  I appreciate it, so I make sure to show you that I love you, that I appreciate you.
[08:18.310 --> 08:21.590]  I know there are thousands of other breeders out there.
[08:21.590 --> 08:28.190]  There are thousands of other breeders on the same website where you buy my shit, so just
[08:28.190 --> 08:32.190]  buying my brand and supporting my brand means a lot to me, so I want to make sure you get
[08:32.230 --> 08:35.270]  more than what you paid for.
[08:35.270 --> 08:37.430]  If you get what you paid for, you feel good.
[08:37.430 --> 08:41.110]  If you don't get what you paid for, you feel kind of angry, but if you get extra, you're
[08:41.110 --> 08:42.830]  like, damn, I'm going to go back there again.
[08:42.830 --> 08:46.830]  It's just inviting, it's encouraging, and I want to show you that I'm appreciative for
[08:46.830 --> 08:47.830]  it.
[08:47.830 --> 08:48.830]  I don't know.
[08:48.830 --> 08:49.830]  I've been given a gift.
[08:49.830 --> 08:55.070]  I don't talk about spirituality and stuff, but I'm rich spiritually and all that shit,
[08:55.070 --> 08:58.070]  so I'm ready to give you more when you spend your money with me.
[08:58.070 --> 08:59.070]  That's what I want to do.
[08:59.070 --> 09:01.470]  Make sure you feel the customer service.
[09:01.470 --> 09:05.310]  You got 15 or 20 table seeds in your 10 pack is where that ramble stemmed from.
[09:05.310 --> 09:08.190]  It goes on to say, here is my question.
[09:08.190 --> 09:11.950]  Since the table seeds are unknown strains but otherwise good genetics, I was going to
[09:11.950 --> 09:14.670]  run all of them at once and do a pheno hunt.
[09:14.670 --> 09:18.950]  That's a really good strategy, but then I got to thinking, is there anything wrong or
[09:18.950 --> 09:21.750]  unethical about breeding with them?
[09:21.750 --> 09:25.710]  I'm in prohibition land, so I'm personally not in it to make a bunch of seeds and sell
[09:25.710 --> 09:26.810]  them.
[09:26.810 --> 09:30.310]  As a breeder, how would you feel if somebody took your table seeds and kept the genetics
[09:30.390 --> 09:33.710]  going by breeding them, maybe even finding something pretty cool?
[09:33.710 --> 09:36.630]  You'll find something pretty fucking cool in there.
[09:36.630 --> 09:39.830]  What's the right thing to do with naming anything that comes out of this?
[09:39.830 --> 09:42.350]  I can see this from both sides.
[09:42.350 --> 09:46.190]  As a breeder, I wouldn't want my name on stuff that I couldn't control the outcomes, but
[09:46.190 --> 09:50.270]  on the flip side, if it comes from stock that I've put my heart and soul into, I'd want
[09:50.270 --> 09:52.390]  to make sure it's legit.
[09:52.390 --> 09:56.310]  If you tell me to fuck off, bro, I would never tell anybody to fuck off.
[09:56.310 --> 09:57.510]  I've got full respect.
[09:57.510 --> 10:00.950]  No matter what your idea is, I'll sit down and have a conversation with you, so never
[10:00.950 --> 10:01.950]  fuck off.
[10:01.950 --> 10:05.510]  Always approach me with a smile and be ready for a friendly conversation.
[10:05.510 --> 10:06.510]  Maybe we'll smoke a dab.
[10:06.510 --> 10:07.510]  However, we got to do it.
[10:07.510 --> 10:10.550]  We'll find a resolution that is friendly that we can both agree on.
[10:10.550 --> 10:13.910]  Never going to tell you to fuck off, no matter who you are out there, unless you need to
[10:13.910 --> 10:14.910]  fuck off.
[10:14.910 --> 10:17.190]  It says, I just want to grow this shit and smoke it.
[10:17.190 --> 10:18.190]  I'm good with that.
[10:18.190 --> 10:20.150]  Oh, if you want me to tell me to fuck off and just grow this shit and smoke it, I'm
[10:20.150 --> 10:21.150]  good with that.
[10:21.150 --> 10:22.430]  Thanks again for all you do.
[10:22.430 --> 10:23.670]  Much love from Canna.
[10:23.670 --> 10:25.750]  No, Grow Can Advocate.
[10:25.750 --> 10:26.750]  All right.
[10:26.750 --> 10:27.750]  This is a very good question.
[10:27.750 --> 10:30.830]  It gives me the opportunity to talk about a couple things here.
[10:30.830 --> 10:34.190]  This person is asking if they can breed with the table seeds.
[10:34.190 --> 10:35.190]  First question.
[10:35.190 --> 10:39.870]  The first question is, can I breed with your seeds is basically what they're asking.
[10:39.870 --> 10:46.270]  Yes, I encourage, support, promote, endorse you breeding with my seeds.
[10:46.270 --> 10:52.630]  If I made the seeds and you acquired them through a reasonable, ethical, moral method,
[10:52.630 --> 10:57.670]  if you didn't steal them, rip somebody off or lie to get them, I encourage you to breed
[10:57.670 --> 10:58.670]  with them.
[10:58.670 --> 10:59.670]  Have a good time.
[10:59.670 --> 11:01.590]  Those are your seeds.
[11:01.590 --> 11:03.150]  You paid money for them.
[11:03.150 --> 11:06.270]  Somebody's got money for them, either myself or the vendor that sold them to you or the
[11:06.270 --> 11:07.950]  bro that sold them to you.
[11:07.950 --> 11:08.950]  Somebody made some money.
[11:08.950 --> 11:15.150]  Once they left my hands, I have no say so, no control, no real, I care that you have
[11:15.150 --> 11:18.790]  a successful outcome, but other than that, I can't really care too much about what you
[11:18.790 --> 11:19.790]  do with them.
[11:19.790 --> 11:21.430]  I can't stay attached to them.
[11:21.430 --> 11:23.150]  Once I accepted money, they're yours.
[11:23.150 --> 11:26.910]  I can't make rules on shit people paid me money for.
[11:26.910 --> 11:28.070]  That's when you tell me to fuck off.
[11:28.070 --> 11:31.270]  When I take your money and give you rules, that's when I fuck off.
[11:31.270 --> 11:32.790]  That's how that should go.
[11:32.790 --> 11:33.790]  I encourage it.
[11:33.790 --> 11:34.790]  I promote it.
[11:34.790 --> 11:35.790]  I endorse it.
[11:35.790 --> 11:36.790]  I support it.
[11:36.790 --> 11:38.430]  Please do breed with the seeds that you get from me.
[11:38.430 --> 11:39.430]  That is cool.
[11:39.430 --> 11:42.270]  I bred with seeds I got from other growers.
[11:42.270 --> 11:45.550]  I bred with seeds and clones that came from other breeders.
[11:45.550 --> 11:47.510]  I did not invent cannabis.
[11:47.510 --> 11:51.110]  I didn't just meditate one day and manifest a batch of seeds.
[11:51.790 --> 11:55.190]  I had to start with seeds or clones that came from another grower, another gardener, which
[11:55.190 --> 11:56.990]  was another breeder.
[11:56.990 --> 11:57.990]  I didn't invent seeds.
[11:57.990 --> 11:59.150]  I didn't invent cannabis.
[11:59.150 --> 12:04.150]  I feel no way territorial or protective of the plant.
[12:04.150 --> 12:06.750]  I do feel protective of the plant, but not of the breeding.
[12:06.750 --> 12:10.230]  You should be able to play freely just like I do.
[12:10.230 --> 12:11.230]  There are seeds.
[12:11.230 --> 12:12.230]  There are grow lights.
[12:12.230 --> 12:13.230]  Have a good time.
[12:13.230 --> 12:14.230]  You've got my blessings.
[12:14.230 --> 12:17.510]  Yeah, I didn't invent this plant, so I can't stop you.
[12:17.510 --> 12:18.590]  I want you to breed.
[12:18.590 --> 12:19.950]  Maybe you'll make better shit than me.
[12:19.950 --> 12:20.950]  That would be awesome.
[12:21.790 --> 12:25.910]  I would be really delighted and proud to see you use one of my packs of seeds and make
[12:25.910 --> 12:28.230]  something better than anything I've ever done.
[12:28.230 --> 12:31.510]  That would make me happy as a teacher, as a breeder.
[12:31.510 --> 12:32.670]  I'm not going to be around forever.
[12:32.670 --> 12:34.070]  I don't expect to fucking live forever.
[12:34.070 --> 12:37.030]  I need people to be a good grower, better breeders.
[12:37.030 --> 12:39.590]  I have to pass this torch eventually.
[12:39.590 --> 12:41.270]  There were breeders that taught me how to do this.
[12:41.270 --> 12:43.230]  I hope to teach you the same way.
[12:43.230 --> 12:47.070]  Also, I hope to teach you good ethics and good morals within breeding.
[12:47.070 --> 12:49.070]  Let's talk about that part now.
[12:49.070 --> 12:50.510]  You can use my stuff.
[12:51.070 --> 12:52.070]  You've got my full permission.
[12:52.070 --> 12:53.950]  When you do that, it would be cool.
[12:53.950 --> 12:56.030]  This is a special case because these are table seeds.
[12:56.030 --> 13:01.870]  If you use any of my seeds that you know what they are, just say, that was strawberry starburst
[13:01.870 --> 13:04.110]  crossed to whatever you used.
[13:04.110 --> 13:05.990]  Just give credit to it.
[13:05.990 --> 13:07.150]  Just be honest.
[13:07.150 --> 13:11.630]  Don't lie and say that secret strain A to secret strain B. First of all, the community
[13:11.630 --> 13:13.870]  doesn't trust you, doesn't want that.
[13:13.870 --> 13:15.310]  But second of all, that's a dick move.
[13:15.310 --> 13:16.310]  Give us credit.
[13:16.310 --> 13:20.230]  If you notice my packages of seeds, it always says this crossed to this.
[13:20.230 --> 13:25.430]  I want you to know that that was Subcool's Jack the Ripper crossed to Maya Rise or however
[13:25.430 --> 13:30.510]  it went, Crockett's Strawberry Fields to my Daybreaker.
[13:30.510 --> 13:31.830]  Whatever I did, I want you to know.
[13:31.830 --> 13:34.950]  That way I'm not lying to anybody, misleading anybody.
[13:34.950 --> 13:38.990]  Also, I'm giving credit to the people who I'm using their work.
[13:38.990 --> 13:39.990]  That's important.
[13:39.990 --> 13:45.430]  Also, medical smokers are looking for relief and they know certain strains help them.
[13:45.430 --> 13:49.870]  If they see that maybe OG Kush is something that works great for a person and then strawberry
[13:50.510 --> 13:53.590]  something, if it's got strawberry in it, maybe it works really good for a person.
[13:53.590 --> 13:57.270]  If they can look through the genetic history and see this has OG Kush and strawberry on
[13:57.270 --> 14:02.070]  one side and OG Kush and the turps on the other side, they know how to map out their
[14:02.070 --> 14:03.550]  medicine a little bit that way.
[14:03.550 --> 14:04.550]  It gives them a hint.
[14:04.550 --> 14:07.870]  It gives them a clue at what to select for their medical consumption.
[14:07.870 --> 14:11.750]  I think it's important for several reasons that we label these plants properly, correctly
[14:11.750 --> 14:15.990]  with the crosses and honor the original breeders that made those plants.
[14:15.990 --> 14:20.190]  I feel that anything you learn, it's very important to honor the source.
[14:20.190 --> 14:21.390]  We aren't fucking wizards.
[14:21.390 --> 14:23.150]  Most of us learn from Google.
[14:23.150 --> 14:27.790]  You'll hear me say a lot of times things like, I learned that from Mr. Soul or I read this
[14:27.790 --> 14:28.790]  in Soma's book.
[14:28.790 --> 14:30.790]  I feel like it's important to teach those sources.
[14:30.790 --> 14:34.630]  That way you guys have the opportunity as well to say, oh, you learned it from Mr. Soul?
[14:34.630 --> 14:38.830]  Then you go research Mr. Soul and then you find out more, learn where I'm learning and
[14:38.830 --> 14:41.270]  then you get a deeper understanding and then we can learn together.
[14:41.270 --> 14:43.510]  I think it's important.
[14:43.510 --> 14:45.630]  I do feel that it is okay to breed with my seeds.
[14:46.270 --> 14:47.270]  I encourage it.
[14:47.270 --> 14:48.270]  I didn't invent them.
[14:48.270 --> 14:53.670]  The ethics would be to put, normally you would just put the strain name, but these are table
[14:53.670 --> 14:58.510]  seeds so you're going to have to put, I read you just put table seeds by I read genetics
[14:58.510 --> 14:59.510]  in the description.
[14:59.510 --> 15:00.510]  You know what I mean?
[15:00.510 --> 15:02.230]  And then I always write a nice story about my strain.
[15:02.230 --> 15:06.110]  So it would just say, I acquired some table seeds from my buddy I read genetics or Rasta
[15:06.110 --> 15:07.630]  Jeff at I read genetics.
[15:07.630 --> 15:11.550]  I found a keeper in there with these traits and described the traits.
[15:11.550 --> 15:13.590]  Maybe just maybe I can identify what you've got.
[15:13.590 --> 15:17.910]  I'm not going to a hundred percent say that I can, but once it's in flower, maybe through
[15:17.910 --> 15:21.790]  visual descriptions, through some aroma descriptions, we can identify what you've got.
[15:21.790 --> 15:26.950]  I'm very familiar with my lineup, but you can honor it by saying it is a table seed
[15:26.950 --> 15:28.630]  from Rasta Jeff from I read genetics.
[15:28.630 --> 15:31.390]  I crossed it to this and this is what I'm doing.
[15:31.390 --> 15:34.750]  And then the really cool thing to do would be send me a 10 pack, but you know, that's
[15:34.750 --> 15:35.750]  not required.
[15:35.750 --> 15:39.070]  I don't have space to grow it right now, but you know, if you find something fire and you
[15:39.070 --> 15:42.790]  breed it and you send it back to me and then I grow that and I breed it to something, I
[15:42.790 --> 15:45.670]  promise you, I send seeds back to you.
[15:45.670 --> 15:47.150]  So that's how that, that works out.
[15:47.150 --> 15:50.350]  I do keep my friends in mind when I'm working with the stuff they send me.
[15:50.350 --> 15:51.350]  Wow.
[15:51.350 --> 15:52.350]  That was a lot of rambling.
[15:52.350 --> 15:53.750]  So where do we go from here?
[15:53.750 --> 15:57.790]  Um, what's the right thing to do with naming anything that comes out of this bro?
[15:57.790 --> 15:59.190]  Name it, whatever you want.
[15:59.190 --> 16:04.390]  You've got my blessing, my honor, name it something that is cool to you.
[16:04.390 --> 16:09.510]  Don't, uh, if you want to honor my line and my work, you can put something in there that
[16:09.510 --> 16:12.230]  would sort of give a hint of where it came from.
[16:12.670 --> 16:14.590]  You could give a pay homage to it through the name.
[16:14.590 --> 16:16.990]  I sort of try to do that with some stuff.
[16:16.990 --> 16:20.910]  Also a blueberry butcher is Jack the Ripper.
[16:20.910 --> 16:22.110]  It's got Jack the Ripper in there.
[16:22.110 --> 16:23.630]  That's why the word butcher ended up in there.
[16:23.630 --> 16:26.970]  It just sounds like blueberry killing you, Jack the Ripper, and it's got blueberry cookies
[16:26.970 --> 16:30.070]  on one side, a blueberry butcher.
[16:30.070 --> 16:32.590]  So I honored the Jack the Ripper in there.
[16:32.590 --> 16:39.710]  Um, a rise got called a rise because it has got daybreaker as the male and daybreaker
[16:39.710 --> 16:43.990]  comes from gauge green genetics and they name a lot of their stuff.
[16:43.990 --> 16:46.990]  One word like uplifting positive words.
[16:46.990 --> 16:48.150]  And I just kept with the theme.
[16:48.150 --> 16:49.990]  I didn't steal a word they were using.
[16:49.990 --> 16:53.750]  A rise was actually submitted by a social media fan.
[16:53.750 --> 16:55.510]  They said arise would be a cool strain name.
[16:55.510 --> 16:56.990]  And I was like, I'm going to use it.
[16:56.990 --> 17:01.890]  So we used a rise that pays tribute to the original breeder that bred one of the strains.
[17:01.890 --> 17:05.870]  It honors that it continues that tradition, but it's also my own thing.
[17:05.870 --> 17:07.630]  So that's where the name arise came from.
[17:07.630 --> 17:09.110]  I don't know if you ever knew that.
[17:09.110 --> 17:10.910]  Um, yeah.
[17:10.910 --> 17:15.230]  So honor me maybe by putting something with my, or just name it something, whatever you
[17:15.230 --> 17:16.230]  want.
[17:16.230 --> 17:19.430]  Uh, if you're into transformers, name it after a fucking transformer.
[17:19.430 --> 17:22.950]  If you're into electronic stuff, name it after some electronic shit.
[17:22.950 --> 17:29.550]  Uh, your grow can advocate do name it something after your cannabis activism or something.
[17:29.550 --> 17:30.550]  I don't know, man.
[17:30.550 --> 17:31.550]  Have fun with the name creation.
[17:31.550 --> 17:33.790]  You get to name it whatever you want.
[17:33.790 --> 17:36.790]  That is part of the beauty of naming strains.
[17:36.870 --> 17:39.550]  I really like to have fun with my naming schemes.
[17:39.550 --> 17:43.030]  Sometimes I drive myself crazy because I've got the perfect name for a strain, but I still
[17:43.030 --> 17:45.270]  insist that it isn't perfect.
[17:45.270 --> 17:47.670]  It doesn't sound like you're trying to make seeds for market.
[17:47.670 --> 17:51.030]  So the name won't be as critical.
[17:51.030 --> 17:55.530]  Sometimes I feel like a name, the name of a strain can dictate the success or failure
[17:55.530 --> 17:56.530]  of that strain.
[17:56.530 --> 17:57.530]  It can be fired.
[17:57.530 --> 18:00.910]  If it's got a bad name, it just won't sell for some reason.
[18:00.910 --> 18:04.470]  Sometimes things on the market don't have the, they're not the best product, but they've
[18:04.470 --> 18:06.910]  got a good name and they just sell because of the name.
[18:06.910 --> 18:09.350]  So I always struggle with the perfect name.
[18:09.350 --> 18:11.670]  I like to crowdsource names a little bit.
[18:11.670 --> 18:12.670]  See what people think.
[18:12.670 --> 18:15.710]  I try to come up with my own stuff, but then let the crowd kind of weigh in a little bit
[18:15.710 --> 18:17.690]  because they're the ones buying it.
[18:17.690 --> 18:22.150]  But come up with a name that means something to you, something that you smile or you grin
[18:22.150 --> 18:25.670]  or you giggle or you feel some sort of pride every time you say that name.
[18:25.670 --> 18:28.710]  And then if you're not going to put it out to market, it doesn't have to be something
[18:28.710 --> 18:30.630]  catchy that's going to catch the market.
[18:30.630 --> 18:32.070]  You can name it whatever you want.
[18:32.070 --> 18:33.410]  It's just yours.
[18:33.410 --> 18:36.830]  So name the strain, whatever feels good to you, whatever is fun to you.
[18:36.830 --> 18:39.630]  Maybe if you've got a family or something or somebody helping you grow it, maybe they've
[18:39.630 --> 18:40.910]  got a name suggestion.
[18:40.910 --> 18:44.310]  Maybe you guys can compile your names, combine your names together, come up with something
[18:44.310 --> 18:45.310]  cool.
[18:45.310 --> 18:46.550]  It's like making up a band name.
[18:46.550 --> 18:47.550]  This is always fun for me.
[18:47.550 --> 18:48.990]  I love this kind of stuff.
[18:48.990 --> 18:52.830]  So I think I covered the basics of your question.
[18:52.830 --> 18:57.050]  You do have the blessing to breed with my stuff.
[18:57.050 --> 19:00.570]  Just put that it's an iReed Genetics table seed in there or an iReed Genetics, however
[19:00.570 --> 19:01.830]  you want to label it.
[19:02.250 --> 19:04.850]  Technically, if you're not going to sell it or do anything with it, you don't have to
[19:04.850 --> 19:07.410]  really worry about that, honestly.
[19:07.410 --> 19:09.930]  But it's just an iReed Genetics table seed.
[19:09.930 --> 19:12.490]  Cross to whatever you choose to cross it with.
[19:12.490 --> 19:13.610]  Name it whatever you want.
[19:13.610 --> 19:14.610]  Have fun.
[19:14.610 --> 19:16.930]  If you want some strain name ideas, let me know what you're working with.
[19:16.930 --> 19:19.690]  Also, let's try to identify this plant.
[19:19.690 --> 19:23.450]  I don't know how to send pictures on Cannaba or on Patreon yet.
[19:23.450 --> 19:26.730]  It doesn't let me attach pictures, but send them to me through my email.
[19:26.730 --> 19:29.190]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[19:29.190 --> 19:33.730]  Maybe as it's early in flower, later in flower, I may be able to help you identify exactly
[19:33.730 --> 19:34.730]  what you're growing.
[19:34.730 --> 19:38.410]  Maybe I can hear some descriptions of the aromas.
[19:38.410 --> 19:39.410]  We'll see what you're working with.
[19:39.410 --> 19:43.010]  We'll be able to tell by how long it takes to flower, the leaf shape, the colors, some
[19:43.010 --> 19:44.010]  aromas.
[19:44.010 --> 19:48.690]  We may be able to at least narrow down some options of what you may have in your garden.
[19:48.690 --> 19:49.690]  Grow can advocate.
[19:49.690 --> 19:52.170]  I rambled for a long time about that.
[19:52.170 --> 19:54.330]  I really hope I answered your question, bro.
[19:54.330 --> 19:55.330]  Breed with my stuff.
[19:55.330 --> 19:57.350]  Everybody out there, have fun breeding.
[19:57.350 --> 19:58.930]  Breed with my stuff.
[19:58.930 --> 20:02.710]  Even if you've got a seed company, breed with some of my stuff.
[20:02.710 --> 20:06.090]  Don't just straight take a male and start a seed company.
[20:06.090 --> 20:09.390]  Take a male, take a female, breed something, select a male from that.
[20:09.390 --> 20:13.990]  Use your own male that's been worked, then make a seed company out of that would be cool.
[20:13.990 --> 20:16.150]  But you've got my blessings.
[20:16.150 --> 20:17.350]  I'm not worried about it.
[20:17.350 --> 20:19.510]  I'm honored that you choose to work with my stuff.
[20:19.510 --> 20:23.510]  There's some good breeding stock in there, so don't be shy.
[20:23.510 --> 20:25.610]  I feel like I do have more messages.
[20:25.610 --> 20:26.830]  How long have we been going?
[20:26.830 --> 20:28.110]  We do have time for another one.
[20:28.130 --> 20:29.930]  This may be a long episode, which is cool.
[20:29.930 --> 20:32.290]  I owe you guys a long one this time.
[20:32.290 --> 20:33.290]  Where are we?
[20:33.290 --> 20:34.490]  This one comes from our friend.
[20:34.490 --> 20:35.610]  They want their name said.
[20:35.610 --> 20:38.690]  Their name is not listed, so we're going to skip that and keep them anonymous.
[20:38.690 --> 20:39.690]  Big shout out to my friend.
[20:39.690 --> 20:40.690]  You'll know who you are.
[20:40.690 --> 20:42.770]  It says, hey Jeff, I love the show.
[20:42.770 --> 20:46.410]  I asked a question during the premiere and you asked me to email it to you.
[20:46.410 --> 20:47.410]  I do remember this.
[20:47.410 --> 20:49.450]  I was watching the premiere on YouTube.
[20:49.450 --> 20:53.750]  The show does premiere on YouTube at 12 o'clock Mountain Time.
[20:53.750 --> 20:55.730]  It's midnight Mountain Time.
[20:55.730 --> 20:58.090]  It is going from Wednesday to Thursday.
[20:58.090 --> 21:05.790]  So it's technically 1159 Wednesday into 12 Thursday at midnight.
[21:05.790 --> 21:07.590]  Mountain Time is when these shows come out.
[21:07.590 --> 21:09.230]  I do the premiere on YouTube.
[21:09.230 --> 21:10.830]  I do Wednesday and Monday.
[21:10.830 --> 21:11.830]  So it'll be Wednesday and Monday.
[21:11.830 --> 21:15.510]  Sorry, it's Sunday into Monday and Wednesday into Thursday is when the premieres come out
[21:15.510 --> 21:16.550]  at midnight.
[21:16.550 --> 21:19.830]  I hang out quite often in the premiere in the chat with my friends.
[21:19.830 --> 21:23.510]  I watch the chat and I talk with the guys and gals that are there and we bullshit a
[21:23.510 --> 21:24.630]  little bit.
[21:24.630 --> 21:27.710]  During that chat, our friend did ask us this question.
[21:27.710 --> 21:30.490]  There was no way for me to remember it or capture it there in the chat.
[21:30.490 --> 21:32.070]  So I said, please email it.
[21:32.070 --> 21:33.150]  This is what we got.
[21:33.150 --> 21:38.530]  It says, could you do a segment or an episode on, and I have to be careful with the words
[21:38.530 --> 21:40.070]  I use because I mentioned this before.
[21:40.070 --> 21:44.330]  We did have a friend whose channel got flagged because they used an inappropriate word, which
[21:44.330 --> 21:48.030]  was really funny because they're using it appropriately, but algorithms will get you
[21:48.030 --> 21:49.390]  in trouble.
[21:49.390 --> 21:53.150]  Can we talk about intersex plants and finding nanners on plants?
[21:53.150 --> 21:56.690]  Those aren't the words on the paper here, but I'm trying to be careful.
[21:56.690 --> 22:00.410]  Do you know how long until nanners develop pollen or can you explain if there's a difference
[22:00.410 --> 22:06.270]  on when nanners show up during week three or when they show up on week five, et cetera?
[22:06.270 --> 22:09.530]  Do you keep them or do you chop based on these circumstances?
[22:09.530 --> 22:11.670]  So this is a very good question.
[22:11.670 --> 22:16.310]  When you're working with some of the new common varietals out there, it is not uncommon to
[22:16.310 --> 22:18.170]  discover intersex plants.
[22:18.170 --> 22:22.250]  That is a plant that appears to be female and then at some point in that plant's life,
[22:22.250 --> 22:24.570]  it throws out male flowers.
[22:24.570 --> 22:28.370]  When that plant throws out male flowers, you've got a decision to make and that's what this
[22:28.370 --> 22:30.550]  question is all about.
[22:30.550 --> 22:34.930]  How do we handle these plants that suddenly tell us that they are intersex plants?
[22:34.930 --> 22:36.690]  We thought we had female plants.
[22:36.690 --> 22:42.650]  A lot of OG Kush and chem stuff will have a tendency to throw some nanners on you because
[22:42.650 --> 22:47.170]  that comes from somewhere down the line in the chems and the OG Kushes.
[22:47.170 --> 22:49.570]  There is an intersex gene.
[22:49.570 --> 22:51.890]  That trait is in there somewhere.
[22:51.890 --> 22:55.490]  We've done a lot of breeding with them to try to wash that out and remove it, but it
[22:55.490 --> 22:57.290]  is always going to be present.
[22:57.290 --> 22:58.770]  It's going to pop up sometimes.
[22:58.770 --> 23:02.450]  It can happen from a lot of different things.
[23:02.450 --> 23:07.250]  Temperature swings, early, late in veg, early in flower, temperature swings, temperature
[23:07.250 --> 23:13.450]  stress, too high or too low of one way or the other can definitely, what's the word,
[23:13.450 --> 23:17.170]  influence intersex traits in our plants.
[23:17.170 --> 23:23.290]  Stress of any sort, early in flower or late in flower can trigger intersex traits in our
[23:23.290 --> 23:24.290]  plants.
[23:24.290 --> 23:30.090]  Overfeeding certain things can cause intersex traits to appear within our plants.
[23:30.090 --> 23:35.210]  Light problems, light leaks, light interruptions can cause intersex traits within our plants.
[23:35.210 --> 23:36.690]  Now let me interrupt myself.
[23:36.690 --> 23:39.730]  I keep saying can cause intersex traits within our plants.
[23:39.730 --> 23:42.930]  These traits are already in the plant.
[23:42.930 --> 23:45.170]  People say this plant turned intersex on me.
[23:45.170 --> 23:47.730]  I always say no, it was always intersex.
[23:47.730 --> 23:51.290]  You just gave it the opportunity to show you.
[23:51.290 --> 23:53.010]  That plant was always an asshole.
[23:53.010 --> 23:56.530]  You just gave it the option to show you it was an asshole.
[23:56.530 --> 23:57.530]  It was always an asshole.
[23:57.530 --> 23:59.130]  It always had that intersex trait.
[23:59.130 --> 24:04.450]  You just never gave it the environment to express that phenotypical expression.
[24:04.450 --> 24:06.690]  Just like purple is a trait.
[24:06.690 --> 24:08.570]  Just like trichomes are a trait.
[24:08.570 --> 24:11.050]  Just like aroma is a trait.
[24:11.050 --> 24:13.250]  Just like the buzz is a trait of a plant.
[24:13.250 --> 24:14.570]  So is intersex.
[24:14.970 --> 24:17.090]  That is a trait that is carried within that plant.
[24:17.090 --> 24:20.650]  If you breed to that plant, it will move that trait along the breeding.
[24:20.650 --> 24:24.050]  The chances of getting it depend on just the genetic mapping.
[24:24.050 --> 24:28.490]  Does this male wash that out with this female or does this female carry that trait?
[24:28.490 --> 24:29.850]  How do we breed it out?
[24:29.850 --> 24:31.370]  How do you miss it?
[24:31.370 --> 24:33.010]  I wouldn't even mess with it honestly.
[24:33.010 --> 24:37.370]  As a breeder with so many options and opportunities for plants, I don't mess with anything that
[24:37.370 --> 24:40.210]  gives me too much or much intersex trait.
[24:40.210 --> 24:41.570]  I don't mess with that.
[24:41.570 --> 24:44.210]  A lot of people have chosen to do that.
[24:44.210 --> 24:47.730]  So the trait is already there.
[24:47.730 --> 24:52.610]  What is happening is we are triggering that trait to express itself in certain environments.
[24:52.610 --> 24:56.850]  So sometimes the plants will show you they have intersex traits early.
[24:56.850 --> 25:00.370]  They'll go right into flower and then you'll see female parts and then you'll see male
[25:00.370 --> 25:01.370]  parts.
[25:01.370 --> 25:02.370]  Like 15 days in.
[25:02.370 --> 25:04.050]  That is an early expressing intersex plant.
[25:04.050 --> 25:05.090]  I would remove that.
[25:05.090 --> 25:06.370]  There's no need to keep that.
[25:06.370 --> 25:07.690]  That is an early intersex.
[25:07.690 --> 25:10.290]  That is going to be a struggle for nine weeks.
[25:10.290 --> 25:13.210]  That is going to be a problem the entire grow.
[25:13.650 --> 25:17.650]  The main problem is that male part and the female part are timed up perfectly to where
[25:17.650 --> 25:22.210]  if pollen does come out, the females are timed perfectly to receive the pollen and there's
[25:22.210 --> 25:26.430]  no way to keep that plant from pollinating itself and the plants around it.
[25:26.430 --> 25:30.410]  So that early intersex sign, I would not even fuck with that.
[25:30.410 --> 25:33.970]  That one goes bye bye quite quickly.
[25:33.970 --> 25:34.970]  No need for a struggle.
[25:34.970 --> 25:36.330]  Set yourself up for success.
[25:36.330 --> 25:38.730]  Get that problematic plant the fuck out of there.
[25:38.730 --> 25:41.970]  Replace it with something good or use that space for one of the plants that's in there
[25:41.970 --> 25:44.330]  just grow a little bit longer.
[25:44.330 --> 25:46.330]  Let's talk about a week three intersex plant.
[25:46.330 --> 25:48.050]  Now that's about, that's about where we are.
[25:48.050 --> 25:53.050]  That's about day 15 day 17 day 20 you'll start seeing those early intersex plants right as
[25:53.050 --> 25:54.570]  things go into flower.
[25:54.570 --> 25:55.570]  Get rid of that.
[25:55.570 --> 25:56.570]  There's no reason to keep that.
[25:56.570 --> 26:01.210]  If you've got replacement plants, better seeds, other opportunities, get rid of that intersex
[26:01.210 --> 26:02.210]  plant.
[26:02.210 --> 26:03.210]  Don't breed with it.
[26:03.210 --> 26:04.210]  Don't grow it.
[26:04.210 --> 26:05.210]  Don't waste your time.
[26:05.210 --> 26:08.650]  There's no need to have that in the garden with all the options for good seeds, good
[26:08.650 --> 26:09.650]  plants.
[26:09.650 --> 26:10.650]  Why?
[26:10.650 --> 26:11.650]  Why fuck with it?
[26:12.010 --> 26:15.650]  Going on a first date and finding out that you're totally not compatible and still trying
[26:15.650 --> 26:17.810]  to stick it out for nine fucking weeks.
[26:17.810 --> 26:19.690]  Let's not do that to ourselves.
[26:19.690 --> 26:22.370]  Call that fucking intersex plant move forward.
[26:22.370 --> 26:23.450]  Let's move later.
[26:23.450 --> 26:26.490]  Let's talk about like week five or week six.
[26:26.490 --> 26:31.870]  If I'm seeing intersex pop up around week five or week six, I've got a decision to make.
[26:31.870 --> 26:33.650]  Is this plant hot fire?
[26:33.650 --> 26:35.150]  Is this something I've grown before?
[26:35.150 --> 26:36.990]  Is this my first run with it?
[26:36.990 --> 26:41.470]  If it's my first run and I'm seeing intersex a week five or six, this plant better have
[26:41.470 --> 26:45.090]  other traits that make it highly desirable.
[26:45.090 --> 26:47.450]  Is it throwing one or two nanners?
[26:47.450 --> 26:48.890]  I may keep her around.
[26:48.890 --> 26:51.610]  She throws four or five, five or six.
[26:51.610 --> 26:52.610]  I'm getting freaked out.
[26:52.610 --> 26:54.050]  I'm getting stressed out.
[26:54.050 --> 27:00.150]  I have to keep an eye on those nanners and see if they develop into, if they start making
[27:00.150 --> 27:02.210]  what looks like could open into a sack.
[27:02.210 --> 27:04.250]  I have to watch how big it's getting.
[27:04.250 --> 27:05.290]  Do I pluck them out?
[27:05.290 --> 27:06.850]  Do I cut those nugs off the plant?
[27:06.850 --> 27:08.930]  Do I cut the plant down entirely?
[27:08.930 --> 27:11.450]  That depends on other traits of the plant.
[27:11.450 --> 27:12.670]  How's the shape of the plant?
[27:12.670 --> 27:13.670]  How's the structure?
[27:13.670 --> 27:14.670]  What's the leaf size?
[27:14.670 --> 27:15.950]  What's the aroma?
[27:15.950 --> 27:19.950]  What does it look like overall other than those couple of nanners in the plant?
[27:19.950 --> 27:23.590]  If there are enough there, five, six, seven, I'm going to get worried.
[27:23.590 --> 27:24.590]  It's going to bother me.
[27:24.590 --> 27:25.670]  I won't be able to sleep at night.
[27:25.670 --> 27:29.670]  Every time I close my eyes, I'm going to go, my crop's getting seeded by an intersex plant
[27:29.670 --> 27:31.150]  that I'm too stubborn to remove.
[27:31.150 --> 27:34.710]  Then I'm going to have to wake up and fucking get rid of it if it's got like nine fucking
[27:34.710 --> 27:35.710]  nanners on it.
[27:35.710 --> 27:39.070]  If it's got two or three, we may keep an eye on it and see what it does.
[27:39.070 --> 27:40.990]  We're going to watch those nanners.
[27:40.990 --> 27:42.610]  They may be sterile.
[27:42.610 --> 27:44.490]  They may never do anything.
[27:44.490 --> 27:46.570]  They may be filled with pollen.
[27:46.570 --> 27:50.330]  It's my job to keep an eye on it and see what they do and make a decision.
[27:50.330 --> 27:53.630]  If they're going to fill with pollen and cause me a problem, I'm going to get rid of them.
[27:53.630 --> 27:57.130]  If those are sterile nanners, let it grow, let it grow, let it grow.
[27:57.130 --> 27:59.270]  There's no reason to cut down sterile nanners.
[27:59.270 --> 28:00.770]  They're not going to do anything.
[28:00.770 --> 28:01.770]  They're ugly.
[28:01.770 --> 28:04.230]  There is a slight herb trait within that plant.
[28:04.230 --> 28:06.050]  Maybe not breed with it.
[28:06.050 --> 28:07.530]  Keep an eye on it.
[28:07.530 --> 28:12.170]  We'll see if certain things are triggering those nanners, but if they just pop up regularly,
[28:12.170 --> 28:15.370]  I've worked with a couple of plants that like at week eight, it'll just pop a couple of
[28:15.370 --> 28:16.890]  nanners.
[28:16.890 --> 28:18.370]  Let's move right into that.
[28:18.370 --> 28:21.030]  Later, later in flower popping nanners.
[28:21.030 --> 28:22.230]  Week eight, week nine.
[28:22.230 --> 28:26.930]  I'm not concerned really because my plants are nine weeks into flower, eight weeks into
[28:26.930 --> 28:27.930]  flower.
[28:27.930 --> 28:31.430]  The pistils on the plants, the parts that would receive the pollen are withered and
[28:31.430 --> 28:32.590]  dry and dusty.
[28:32.590 --> 28:34.330]  They're not going to get any pollen at this point.
[28:34.330 --> 28:35.830]  They will not pollinate my plants.
[28:36.130 --> 28:39.230]  All right, so if we're getting nanners around week eight or week nine, I don't worry too
[28:39.230 --> 28:44.110]  much because those plants are too far into their life cycle to become pollinated.
[28:44.110 --> 28:49.070]  The thing I am concerned with is if I'm running a perpetual grow, which I often do, which
[28:49.070 --> 28:52.930]  would mean that I've got plants coming in as plants are going out.
[28:52.930 --> 28:57.590]  So I may have some plants right at peak pollination time while these plants at week eight or week
[28:57.590 --> 29:02.810]  nine possibly are producing nanners which may contain pollen.
[29:02.810 --> 29:05.010]  Now we got a couple of things to think about.
[29:05.010 --> 29:06.270]  Do we pick out those nanners?
[29:06.270 --> 29:07.910]  Do we chop off the buds with the nanners?
[29:07.910 --> 29:08.910]  It's usually the top.
[29:08.910 --> 29:11.350]  So do you want to do that?
[29:11.350 --> 29:15.330]  Are those nanners going to produce pollen or are they sterile?
[29:15.330 --> 29:21.030]  Most of the time in my experience, a plant that expresses an intersex trait around week
[29:21.030 --> 29:26.010]  eight or week nine generally produces sterile flowers.
[29:26.010 --> 29:27.710]  They do not have any pollen in them.
[29:27.710 --> 29:29.570]  They do not create any pollination.
[29:29.570 --> 29:31.910]  They don't cause any problems.
[29:31.910 --> 29:33.590]  That is most of my experience.
[29:33.610 --> 29:39.570]  I have seen the opposite, but probably 90% of the time, those late flower intersex male
[29:39.570 --> 29:43.630]  flowers are not threatening to my crop.
[29:43.630 --> 29:46.690]  Those are, let's talk about a previous episode.
[29:46.690 --> 29:51.530]  Those are the plant trying to find a way to survive.
[29:51.530 --> 29:55.730]  Sometimes those plants may pollinate, but most of the time those nanners that pop up
[29:55.730 --> 29:58.190]  late do not contain any pollen.
[29:58.190 --> 30:00.330]  So they usually do not stress me.
[30:00.330 --> 30:06.150]  Again, if there are one or two, two or three, once we get up to like five or seven, again,
[30:06.150 --> 30:08.390]  I start going, what is with that plant?
[30:08.390 --> 30:09.390]  And it's already done.
[30:09.390 --> 30:10.510]  We're at week eight or week nine.
[30:10.510 --> 30:11.990]  I'll let it finish up.
[30:11.990 --> 30:16.430]  I may grow it one more time and maybe not push it so hard at the end or maybe push it
[30:16.430 --> 30:17.750]  harder at the end.
[30:17.750 --> 30:19.250]  Usually I push the plants pretty fucking hard.
[30:19.250 --> 30:22.470]  That is probably what caused it to show me intersex traits.
[30:22.470 --> 30:26.910]  So during the next grow, I would simply reduce my feed, be a little bit more careful with
[30:26.910 --> 30:31.530]  my light cycle, pay a little bit more attention and see if I can make that plant not show
[30:31.530 --> 30:33.410]  me intersex traits on the second run.
[30:33.410 --> 30:36.090]  If it does it again, I've got a decision to make.
[30:36.090 --> 30:37.090]  Am I going to get rid of it?
[30:37.090 --> 30:38.410]  Is it worth keeping it?
[30:38.410 --> 30:41.170]  So that is a late flowering plant.
[30:41.170 --> 30:44.610]  It's doing that in late flower because it wants to survive.
[30:44.610 --> 30:49.370]  It's doing what we were calling the Jurassic park effect in a previous episode.
[30:49.370 --> 30:51.690]  These plants have the will to survive.
[30:51.690 --> 30:53.490]  Life does find a way.
[30:53.510 --> 30:57.430]  So that is why they're showing you intersex in week nine or week 10.
[30:57.430 --> 30:59.030]  Some later flowering plants will do it.
[30:59.030 --> 31:03.270]  If you've got a 10 or 11, 12 week flowering plant, it may do it in the last two weeks
[31:03.270 --> 31:04.950]  right before harvest time.
[31:04.950 --> 31:08.990]  Naturally in the environment, that plant would have been destroyed by something.
[31:08.990 --> 31:10.910]  A goat would have eaten it.
[31:10.910 --> 31:12.510]  Something the wind would have taken it down.
[31:12.510 --> 31:13.510]  Nature would have knocked it over.
[31:13.510 --> 31:16.310]  The wind, the weather, the rain, something would have knocked it down.
[31:16.310 --> 31:18.270]  It never would have gotten that far in nature.
[31:18.270 --> 31:20.110]  And if it did, it would have said, I don't know what to do.
[31:20.110 --> 31:21.670]  Why didn't I get pollinated yet?
[31:21.810 --> 31:26.210]  Like I've spoken about before, these plants main goal is to reproduce.
[31:26.210 --> 31:29.170]  They want to survive so there can be more plants for next year.
[31:29.170 --> 31:33.010]  And if we don't give them the opportunity to mate, they'll find a way.
[31:33.010 --> 31:35.530]  And that plant just goes, Hey, you didn't pollinate me.
[31:35.530 --> 31:37.690]  I've been putting all of my energy into making babies.
[31:37.690 --> 31:38.770]  You never gave me that opportunity.
[31:38.770 --> 31:40.490]  I'm going to figure it out.
[31:40.490 --> 31:43.370]  And there's something in these plants that says I can make my own male parts.
[31:43.370 --> 31:45.530]  And it's just start spitting out flowers.
[31:45.530 --> 31:49.490]  We have selected, hopefully through breeding, uh, through selective breeding and through
[31:49.490 --> 31:51.050]  several generations.
[31:51.430 --> 31:54.950]  Hopefully we've removed most of those intersex traits, but it is still there.
[31:54.950 --> 31:56.110]  It's still an opportunity.
[31:56.110 --> 31:57.110]  It's going to pop up.
[31:57.110 --> 32:00.390]  It's not removed from the cannabis gene pool by any means.
[32:00.390 --> 32:02.350]  It's all about selection.
[32:02.350 --> 32:09.350]  So I went on a really good ramble there, but, uh, early, uh, showing intersex plants, they
[32:09.350 --> 32:12.390]  go mid flower, like week five or week six.
[32:12.390 --> 32:17.250]  You've got some things to think about late flowering plants that show intersex traits.
[32:17.250 --> 32:20.510]  If they're fire, keep them around, let them have a couple of nanners at the end.
[32:20.970 --> 32:22.970]  You probably won't cause any problems.
[32:22.970 --> 32:26.610]  And if they do pollinate, uh, use those seeds, grow them yourself.
[32:26.610 --> 32:28.490]  You've got some really cool bag seeds.
[32:28.490 --> 32:29.870]  Don't share them with your friends.
[32:29.870 --> 32:31.890]  Don't make any money off of them, but grow them.
[32:31.890 --> 32:34.350]  Cause you may have some really cool shit.
[32:34.350 --> 32:38.050]  If that plant was cool enough to keep around until week nine or week 10, even though it
[32:38.050 --> 32:41.570]  made some intersex flowers, it's probably good smoke.
[32:41.570 --> 32:46.130]  Maybe whatever you accidentally bred that too is going to be better or equally good
[32:46.130 --> 32:47.450]  smoke with different traits.
[32:47.450 --> 32:48.590]  Either way, it's a fun project.
[32:48.590 --> 32:51.050]  You've got some free bag seeds to work with.
[32:51.050 --> 32:53.610]  If you're a new grower, you're new at germinating seeds.
[32:53.610 --> 32:55.130]  There's some seeds you could try to germinate.
[32:55.130 --> 32:56.570]  They were free.
[32:56.570 --> 32:58.970]  Practice seeds are never a bad thing.
[32:58.970 --> 33:02.250]  So let me make sure I answered the majority of your question here.
[33:02.250 --> 33:03.930]  Cause I do feel like I got rambly.
[33:03.930 --> 33:06.570]  Uh, do an episode or segment on nanners.
[33:06.570 --> 33:08.970]  Um, I like to use the word intersex.
[33:08.970 --> 33:10.770]  We're going to avoid the H word.
[33:10.770 --> 33:14.490]  I definitely don't like the shortened version of the H word.
[33:14.490 --> 33:17.410]  Um, that just sounds childish to me.
[33:17.430 --> 33:20.230]  Say it, uh, H and then E at the end of it.
[33:20.230 --> 33:22.870]  H E that just sounds like a child third grade word.
[33:22.870 --> 33:25.670]  Uh, just say just Herman or something like that.
[33:25.670 --> 33:27.630]  If you're going to do it, say short for Herman.
[33:27.630 --> 33:29.470]  Uh, don't say hermany.
[33:29.470 --> 33:31.990]  We're just going to end up with a YouTube fucking strike here.
[33:31.990 --> 33:34.230]  Intersex is the word we want to use guys.
[33:34.230 --> 33:36.990]  Intersex is the appropriate word for what we're talking about.
[33:36.990 --> 33:39.110]  Um, do a show on intersex.
[33:39.110 --> 33:40.110]  Yes.
[33:40.110 --> 33:41.550]  A week three, cut it week five or six.
[33:41.550 --> 33:46.230]  You got decisions to make a late flowering, a late showing intersex.
[33:46.530 --> 33:48.210]  Uh, they're probably sterile.
[33:48.210 --> 33:52.850]  Um, probably not too big of a deal unless maybe you've got a perpetual and maybe that's
[33:52.850 --> 33:56.290]  not a sterile, uh, male flower popping up.
[33:56.290 --> 33:59.510]  Most of the time intersex is from, uh, it is in there.
[33:59.510 --> 34:01.130]  It's not something that you did.
[34:01.130 --> 34:02.130]  It is in there.
[34:02.130 --> 34:03.610]  And then it just expressed itself.
[34:03.610 --> 34:06.890]  It's just a trait that was always in the plant waiting to show you had to trigger it, give
[34:06.890 --> 34:07.890]  it the right environment.
[34:07.890 --> 34:11.070]  Uh, and a lot of that is just from breeding selection.
[34:11.070 --> 34:15.730]  We have to choose better plants, uh, stress test the plants before you breed with them.
[34:15.730 --> 34:18.070]  Test the progeny before you sell them.
[34:18.070 --> 34:20.430]  That is my short ramble on intersex plants.
[34:20.430 --> 34:21.430]  You guys.
[34:21.430 --> 34:23.990]  Um, I think I covered a lot of ground in this episode.
[34:23.990 --> 34:28.830]  I want to thank everybody again for listening to episode 660 of the grow from your heart
[34:28.830 --> 34:29.890]  podcast.
[34:29.890 --> 34:33.170]  When I say the numbers at the start of the show, it puts a big smile on my face and it
[34:33.170 --> 34:38.990]  blows my mind every time 660 episodes and many of you have been along for the entire
[34:38.990 --> 34:39.990]  journey.
[34:39.990 --> 34:42.230]  A lot of you jumped on right when we came into YouTube.
[34:42.230 --> 34:43.990]  Some people are just jumping in.
[34:44.130 --> 34:46.130]  Each and every one of you truly.
[34:46.130 --> 34:47.130]  Thank you.
[34:47.130 --> 34:48.130]  Big salute.
[34:48.130 --> 34:49.130]  I appreciate you.
[34:49.130 --> 34:50.130]  Please hang up.
[34:50.130 --> 34:52.330]  I only in only plan and intend.
[34:52.330 --> 34:54.030]  I was on a roll there for a minute.
[34:54.030 --> 34:55.030]  It's just going to get better.
[34:55.030 --> 34:56.030]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[34:56.030 --> 34:57.070]  You guys stick around.
[34:57.070 --> 34:58.070]  Thank you.
[34:58.070 --> 34:59.070]  I owe it to you to make the show better.
[34:59.070 --> 35:00.130]  I've got the other camera.
[35:00.130 --> 35:03.610]  I'm learning fucking more tricks with the editing, trying to make it a great show for
[35:03.610 --> 35:05.930]  you, trying to keep the quality content going.
[35:05.930 --> 35:07.090]  That's enough of that stuff.
[35:07.090 --> 35:08.090]  All right.
[35:08.090 --> 35:09.090]  I think that's all we've got for this episode.
[35:09.090 --> 35:12.050]  I covered a couple of good topics, covered a lot of ground here.
[35:12.110 --> 35:14.870]  If you've got any questions, corrections, comments or concerns, you know I would love
[35:14.870 --> 35:15.870]  to hear from you.

[35:44.370 --> 35:45.370]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[35:45.370 --> 35:51.130]  I want to give a giant shout out to my friend, Brian C. And until next time, take a fat dab
[35:51.130 --> 35:58.000]  and give your mom a hug for me.
