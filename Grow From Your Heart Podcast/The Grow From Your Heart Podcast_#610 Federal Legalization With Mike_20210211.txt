[00:00.120 --> 00:02.120]  All right, here we go.
[00:02.120 --> 00:03.480]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:03.480 --> 00:04.480]  I'm your host.
[00:04.480 --> 00:09.880]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 610 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:09.880 --> 00:14.480]  In this episode, my buddy Mike is going to join me to talk about federal legalization.
[00:14.480 --> 00:18.000]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the folks who support the show
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.620]  on Patreon.
[00:19.620 --> 00:21.780]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:21.780 --> 00:22.780]  Thank you.
[00:22.780 --> 00:26.080]  Shout-out to my buddy Indica B. Let's send a thank you shout-out to Sam Heads.
[00:26.080 --> 00:30.040]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Kurt Z and Zoso J. Let's send a big thank you shout-out
[00:30.040 --> 00:31.040]  to my buddy Tonto.
[00:31.040 --> 00:33.840]  Let's send a thank you shout-out to Danky Dave.
[00:33.840 --> 00:37.820]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to my buddy Glenn Gironi.
[00:37.820 --> 00:41.980]  Let's follow that up with a thank you shout-out to Coach Steve and Mr. And last, but certainly
[00:41.980 --> 00:46.540]  not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout-out to my buddy
[00:46.540 --> 00:51.280]  Noah N. Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[00:51.280 --> 00:54.320]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all
[00:54.320 --> 01:00.200]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:00.200 --> 01:02.560]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.760]  And of course I did include that link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:06.760 --> 01:09.180]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:09.180 --> 01:13.400]  Now it is my turn to turn the mic over to my good friend Mike, so he can say thanks
[01:13.400 --> 01:15.320]  to all of his Patreon friends.
[01:15.320 --> 01:16.320]  Welcome to the show, Mike.
[01:16.320 --> 01:17.320]  What's up, man?
[01:17.320 --> 01:18.320]  How are you doing everybody?
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.280]  Oh, good to be back.
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.280]  Good to be back.
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.040]  It's good to have you on here, bro.
[01:25.040 --> 01:26.040]  It is good to have you on here.
[01:26.040 --> 01:29.640]  I know you just took a monster dab right before we pressed record, but are there any folks
[01:29.640 --> 01:31.920]  I could see it on your face.
[01:31.920 --> 01:34.880]  That's why I'm trying to buy you a moment here before I expect you to do shout-outs
[01:34.880 --> 01:35.880]  to those Patreon folks.
[01:35.880 --> 01:40.240]  There are definitely some folks I'd love to throw some shout-outs to that support me on
[01:40.240 --> 01:41.680]  Patreon.
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.480]  Thank you to all the people that support me on Patreon and the people that support the
[01:44.480 --> 01:45.480]  show.
[01:45.480 --> 01:50.080]  We could definitely not do this without all of you.
[01:50.080 --> 01:52.560]  Six shout-outs this month I'd want to say.
[01:52.560 --> 01:59.000]  Thank you very much to Lernen and Bernan, Farmer Z, OG Purple Thumb, Richard, The Grow
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.600]  From Your Heart Podcast, and Chris.
[02:01.600 --> 02:07.400]  Thank you all so very much for supporting me.
[02:07.400 --> 02:09.800]  I'm blown away by all the support we get.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  I love you guys.
[02:10.800 --> 02:11.800]  Thank you very much.
[02:11.800 --> 02:15.440]  Isn't it cool that we talk into a microphone, we talk to each other here on camera, and
[02:15.440 --> 02:17.080]  then people want to support us financially.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.640]  I think it's a beautiful thing.
[02:18.640 --> 02:19.640]  Thank you.
[02:19.640 --> 02:20.640]  I appreciate it as well.
[02:20.640 --> 02:23.880]  Mike's all dabbed out and choked up from a dab, but we do mean it from the bottom of
[02:23.880 --> 02:25.700]  our coughing little hearts.
[02:25.700 --> 02:27.720]  Thank you guys for all that Patreon support.
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.200]  If I do look distracted, I do have the Zoom meeting here.
[02:31.200 --> 02:32.200]  I'm looking at Mike here.
[02:32.200 --> 02:33.200]  The camera's here.
[02:33.200 --> 02:34.600]  The notes are here.
[02:34.600 --> 02:36.360]  The dab rig's over here.
[02:36.360 --> 02:37.360]  The pipe is here.
[02:37.360 --> 02:39.720]  A lot of pieces of motion tonight.
[02:39.720 --> 02:42.900]  I don't know where my brain is, so all these pieces are moving.
[02:42.900 --> 02:43.900]  It's going to happen.
[02:43.900 --> 02:45.160]  We're going to make a podcast out of it.
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.160]  Thank you guys for joining us.
[02:46.160 --> 02:47.160]  Dude, welcome to the show, Mike.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.160]  I know we got your Patreon shout-outs out of the way.
[02:49.160 --> 02:50.960]  It's been a minute and a half.
[02:50.960 --> 02:52.480]  I'm so glad to be back.
[02:52.480 --> 02:58.120]  We've had a hell of a time getting our schedules lined up.
[02:58.120 --> 02:59.120]  We succeeded today.
[02:59.120 --> 03:00.120]  Yes.
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.360]  I'm not even going to say how many failed and bailed attempts we've had on trying to
[03:03.360 --> 03:07.360]  record in the past few weekends or weeks, but we're here and I'm excited.
[03:07.360 --> 03:08.360]  That's what counts.
[03:08.360 --> 03:10.000]  That's what matters.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  Looking good in that new IRIE Genetics hoodie there, buddy.
[03:13.000 --> 03:14.560]  Loving it, y'all.
[03:14.560 --> 03:15.760]  I'm glad that you were able to-
[03:15.760 --> 03:17.200]  Check that merch store, y'all.
[03:17.240 --> 03:19.400]  It's great gear.
[03:19.400 --> 03:23.960]  Or if you're a local, save some shipping money and we'll socially distance.
[03:23.960 --> 03:24.960]  Just hit up Jeff.
[03:24.960 --> 03:26.360]  Yeah, we'll meet you in a parking lot.
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.600]  We'll use the t-shirt cannon and just shoot it from my car to yours, right into your car
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.600]  window.
[03:31.600 --> 03:33.240]  Maybe I can shoot it right at you to where I shoot it on you.
[03:33.240 --> 03:36.680]  If we do it just right, shoot your new t-shirt onto you with the t-shirt cannon.
[03:36.680 --> 03:38.240]  That's fucking weird.
[03:38.240 --> 03:39.240]  Looking good, bro.
[03:39.240 --> 03:40.240]  I'm glad you came by and picked that up.
[03:40.240 --> 03:42.640]  It was good seeing you.
[03:42.640 --> 03:43.640]  Let's jump right into it.
[03:43.640 --> 03:44.720]  No need to dick around.
[03:44.720 --> 03:46.160]  We can get talkative.
[03:46.160 --> 03:48.400]  Let's just get talkative on a subject.
[03:48.400 --> 03:52.280]  I wrote down politicians and the government have been teasing us.
[03:52.280 --> 03:53.280]  They're doing stuff again.
[03:53.280 --> 03:54.520]  They're doing shit.
[03:54.520 --> 03:58.120]  Not only are they getting their house invaded, they're up to other shit as well.
[03:58.120 --> 04:00.000]  I'm not even going there.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.440]  Couldn't resist.
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.480]  These fine folks are taunting us and teasing us with the idea, with the allure of federal
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.480]  cannabis legalization.
[04:07.480 --> 04:12.120]  So I thought it would be a good time to have Mike back on, talk about this.
[04:12.120 --> 04:13.960]  Mike is, I'm kind of the grow guy for sure.
[04:13.960 --> 04:15.760]  Got my grow stuff, breeding stuff.
[04:16.360 --> 04:19.640]  I've proven in a past episode, I do make some mistakes and say some silly shit.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.720]  However, most of the time I get the grow stuff figured out.
[04:21.720 --> 04:26.320]  Mike is my political guy, my educational guy, my news guy.
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.360]  So I brought him on to talk about this federal legalization opportunity, figure out what's
[04:31.360 --> 04:33.920]  going to happen, what could, what might, what won't happen.
[04:33.920 --> 04:36.640]  Mike is the good guy for that.
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.720]  The first thing I wanted to mention, the first thing, I know we brought Mike on so that I
[04:39.720 --> 04:40.720]  could talk exactly.
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.520]  The first thing I wanted to talk about though, it's the coolest thing.
[04:44.560 --> 04:46.480]  People are going to be let out of prison.
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.440]  In some states people are already being let out of prison for cannabis crimes.
[04:50.440 --> 04:54.200]  If you're in prison for cannabis possession or something involving cannabis, people are
[04:54.200 --> 04:55.840]  being let out.
[04:55.840 --> 04:57.120]  That's amazing to me, dude.
[04:57.120 --> 04:59.720]  That is super cool.
[04:59.720 --> 05:01.000]  It's fantastic.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.480]  Whether that's part of the federal legalization bill, we'll see.
[05:05.480 --> 05:06.480]  Hopefully it is.
[05:06.480 --> 05:11.640]  Cory Booker is one of the three main people leading this charge right now, or at least
[05:11.760 --> 05:14.560]  leading this tease right now.
[05:14.560 --> 05:17.600]  I know that's something near and dear to his heart.
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.120]  We might see some of that coming down the pipe federally, but it's definitely happening
[05:21.120 --> 05:23.880]  in different states around the country.
[05:23.880 --> 05:24.880]  It's beautiful to see.
[05:24.880 --> 05:27.360]  If it's not happening in your state, write your governor.
[05:27.360 --> 05:30.360]  Yeah, especially if you have legal cannabis there and there are still people in jail.
[05:30.360 --> 05:32.440]  I'm going to say that a lot this episode.
[05:32.440 --> 05:33.440]  You are.
[05:33.440 --> 05:35.680]  That might just be the name of the episode.
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.320]  If you're in a legal cannabis state and there are still people locked up for cannabis crimes
[05:39.320 --> 05:40.320]  there, what's the word, Mike?
[05:40.320 --> 05:43.120]  When we start letting people out for things that they did in the past, what's the word
[05:43.120 --> 05:44.600]  or the term for that?
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.600]  Humanity.
[05:45.600 --> 05:46.600]  Yeah, okay.
[05:46.600 --> 05:48.560]  There's a technical prison word, the legal term.
[05:48.560 --> 05:49.560]  Parole.
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.560]  It's better than parole.
[05:51.560 --> 05:52.560]  Clemency.
[05:52.560 --> 05:53.600]  Something like that.
[05:53.600 --> 05:55.360]  You get fucking freedom, bro.
[05:55.360 --> 05:59.200]  You get let out of prison because what you did wasn't a crime and the rules have changed
[05:59.200 --> 06:02.600]  to where now we feel that it's more humane exactly to let you out and let you go back,
[06:02.600 --> 06:04.800]  play with your family, be with your friends.
[06:04.800 --> 06:05.800]  I think it's beautiful.
[06:05.800 --> 06:06.800]  We're out here smoking.
[06:06.800 --> 06:08.160]  There are dispensaries.
[06:08.160 --> 06:12.040]  Why should people be in jail for something that some 19 year old girl is fucking doing
[06:12.040 --> 06:16.200]  right over the counter and making a job and making tax money doing it when there's guys
[06:16.200 --> 06:20.440]  there or other women also in jail for fucking doing exactly what people are doing at the
[06:20.440 --> 06:21.440]  store now.
[06:21.440 --> 06:22.960]  I think it's great that people are going to get freed.
[06:22.960 --> 06:24.460]  That's beautiful.
[06:24.460 --> 06:30.720]  It's definitely hard to defend keeping someone in jail for selling pot when they have stores
[06:30.720 --> 06:34.960]  on the corner that are paying for schools.
[06:34.960 --> 06:36.440]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.440]  I agree.
[06:38.160 --> 06:43.200]  States like Colorado and Washington that didn't lead with some of that in our laws
[06:43.200 --> 06:49.280]  are going back retroactively now in correcting that continued mistake that we left on the
[06:49.280 --> 06:50.480]  books.
[06:50.480 --> 06:56.240]  Other states, I think Illinois is one that made that a main piece of their law and they're
[06:56.240 --> 06:58.520]  at least trying.
[06:58.520 --> 07:02.520]  There's a ton of states, not just federally right now, which is sort of the main focus
[07:02.520 --> 07:07.200]  of the show, but there are a lot of individual states that have dragged their feet on medical
[07:07.960 --> 07:12.080]  and recreational legalization that are now saying, all right, everybody around us has
[07:12.080 --> 07:13.280]  already done it.
[07:13.280 --> 07:17.520]  If you only have to drive two states over to get it, it doesn't make sense that we don't
[07:17.520 --> 07:18.520]  have it here too.
[07:18.520 --> 07:19.520]  Absolutely.
[07:19.520 --> 07:20.520]  Yeah.
[07:20.520 --> 07:21.520]  I read one.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.200]  I can't remember which politician, but it was a Southern red state prohibition state
[07:26.200 --> 07:31.920]  politician whose quote was, if they'll drive the next state over to get fireworks, they're
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.320]  going to drive the next state over to buy cannabis.
[07:35.320 --> 07:36.960]  We might as well just have it here.
[07:37.720 --> 07:43.520]  And it's a little sillier than that in reality, because there's already plenty of marijuana
[07:43.520 --> 07:44.520]  for sale everywhere.
[07:44.520 --> 07:45.520]  Everywhere.
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.760]  But not everybody has a hookup.
[07:47.760 --> 07:48.760]  Not legally.
[07:48.760 --> 07:50.120]  I like to use my mom as an example.
[07:50.120 --> 07:51.440]  My mom doesn't shop at the dispensary.
[07:51.440 --> 07:52.440]  She's my mom.
[07:52.440 --> 07:53.440]  She wouldn't need the shop.
[07:53.440 --> 07:57.800]  But if my mom wanted to buy cannabis, I wouldn't want her to go find one of the guys in the
[07:57.800 --> 07:58.800]  hood.
[07:58.800 --> 08:00.280]  I'd much rather her go to the store.
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.880]  She's going to get what she pays for with a receipt.
[08:03.880 --> 08:06.560]  I like to say that it's going to be lab tested and clean and all that.
[08:06.560 --> 08:09.360]  But with the dispensary reports we've been seeing, that could be a totally different
[08:09.360 --> 08:10.360]  episode.
[08:10.360 --> 08:14.960]  But yeah, so I agree that if my mom had a life threatening condition, somebody in her
[08:14.960 --> 08:20.320]  position, they drive two hours or four hours to another state to get it other than go.
[08:20.320 --> 08:21.320]  Plenty of people do.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.320]  Yeah.
[08:22.320 --> 08:25.200]  It's easier for her to risk getting arrested and crossing state lines than it is to go
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.200]  into the hood.
[08:26.200 --> 08:28.960]  And I keep saying the hood just to put the mental image in there.
[08:29.520 --> 08:34.080]  It's an argument I used to make in front of city council regularly.
[08:34.080 --> 08:40.520]  The people who everyone agrees should have ready access to cannabis, like somebody's
[08:40.520 --> 08:44.060]  grandma with cancer was always my example.
[08:44.060 --> 08:47.680]  Everybody agrees that she should have access to it.
[08:47.680 --> 08:51.800]  Everybody kind of understands that she might not be able to grow it herself.
[08:51.800 --> 08:57.320]  Everybody understands that if she goes to her doctor and gets that diagnosis, it's unreasonable
[08:57.320 --> 09:03.040]  to say just suffer through the chemo for nine months while you learn to grow your first
[09:03.040 --> 09:08.480]  crop and then maybe enjoy some relief almost a year down the road.
[09:08.480 --> 09:11.480]  Maybe you'll have all that's unreasonable to grow the crop while you're going through
[09:11.480 --> 09:12.480]  chemo.
[09:12.480 --> 09:16.640]  Maybe you'll have a successful crop, you know, like, yeah, so many maybes in there.
[09:16.640 --> 09:18.200]  All right, Mike, let's get this back.
[09:18.200 --> 09:21.600]  She was always my example for like why we should have a store everywhere.
[09:21.600 --> 09:22.600]  Yeah.
[09:22.600 --> 09:27.520]  I remember working at that dispensary in 2007 and 2008 showed me so many people that
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.560]  were shining examples of why medical cannabis should be widely available and affordable
[09:32.560 --> 09:33.560]  for people.
[09:33.560 --> 09:36.940]  We were trying to hook everybody up the best we could, and we were a profitable business
[09:36.940 --> 09:40.120]  while still giving away large quantities of products.
[09:40.120 --> 09:43.440]  So I know that it's a viable with all the new licensing and shit, but still, we were
[09:43.440 --> 09:44.440]  doing it.
[09:44.440 --> 09:45.440]  All right.
[09:45.440 --> 09:46.440]  I want to put us back on track.
[09:46.440 --> 09:49.660]  I do have some questions here, and I can kind of segue into this.
[09:49.660 --> 09:51.360]  What else happens if we federally legalize?
[09:51.680 --> 09:53.320]  You're my guy to ask all these silly questions.
[09:53.320 --> 09:56.640]  So right now, literally everything's up in the air.
[09:58.920 --> 10:04.600]  The Democrats have control of the presidency, the House and the Senate,
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.880]  and you have to get all three of those to agree to pass any new law like federal
[10:09.880 --> 10:10.880]  legalization.
[10:11.240 --> 10:14.080]  So they built hotels on Park Place and Boardwalk, basically.
[10:14.920 --> 10:19.760]  Yeah. And the hotels, the the the hitch here is
[10:19.760 --> 10:21.440]  Democrats suck with power.
[10:22.800 --> 10:26.480]  Their first idea is always, let's take all the Republican ideas first.
[10:27.240 --> 10:30.480]  And that usually leads to getting little to nothing done.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.440]  And that's what I'm afraid is going to happen here.
[10:33.680 --> 10:39.000]  It's still sort of monumental that this up front
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.400]  in a new presidential term, they're already talking about stuff that's this
[10:45.200 --> 10:46.240]  culture worry.
[10:46.720 --> 10:50.720]  Like we're also 40 years too late on this, but as far as politics is concerned,
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.560]  especially in the US, legalizing cannabis is, oh, my God, I can't believe you're
[10:56.560 --> 10:58.360]  bringing that up. That's insane.
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.520]  Whereas everybody in the public is like, this has made sense for 30 years now.
[11:03.520 --> 11:05.640]  It should have happened 30 years ago.
[11:07.360 --> 11:08.760]  They're at least talking about it.
[11:08.840 --> 11:11.560]  The upside is a lot.
[11:11.560 --> 11:15.880]  A lot of people are interested in it and nothing set yet.
[11:15.880 --> 11:20.320]  They haven't said what they think it'll look like if they're talking about just
[11:20.320 --> 11:24.920]  moving cannabis from schedule one to schedule three, if they're talking about
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.440]  descheduling it off the scheduled narcotics list completely.
[11:30.080 --> 11:35.520]  All of that changes what's possible on the ground where we interact with people.
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.200]  They could just move it to schedule from schedule one to schedule three, which
[11:42.240 --> 11:45.760]  would mean better access to medical research.
[11:47.120 --> 11:52.840]  Doctors would be potentially able to actually conduct human trials so we could
[11:52.840 --> 11:59.080]  give people better dosages, develop better designer drugs to treat different
[11:59.080 --> 12:05.680]  ailments. But it wouldn't really allow for the anybody can grow cannabis and sell it
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.920]  to their friend without incurring the wrath of the local police department type
[12:10.920 --> 12:13.320]  legalization that we all know should exist.
[12:14.040 --> 12:17.120]  That was going to be, it should be like tomatoes kind of guy.
[12:18.320 --> 12:23.800]  Right. Like a little, it should be kept a little secure than tomatoes because like if
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.400]  an animal or a human gets into it, like it can lead to some problems, especially if
[12:28.400 --> 12:30.120]  it's like a kid or a dog or whatever.
[12:30.120 --> 12:34.120]  But yeah, um, and that's less true with tomatoes.
[12:34.320 --> 12:38.400]  Like is all. So I just put a better fence around it to keep little kids and dogs out
[12:38.400 --> 12:44.320]  of it. But that's probably not going to happen politically, at least not anytime
[12:44.320 --> 12:51.480]  soon. I think the best we can hope for is a system kind of like Colorado's where it's
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.640]  a little too expensive to get in and it's much more restrictive than it should be.
[12:56.640 --> 12:59.640]  But it's a hell of a lot better than everything that's come before.
[12:59.920 --> 13:04.320]  Right. Just stop arresting people for having cannabis in a lot of places would be a
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.120]  huge step. Start letting people out of prison would be a huge step.
[13:07.120 --> 13:09.160]  Then let us grow our own medicine would be huge.
[13:09.680 --> 13:11.680]  The numbers are astronomical.
[13:11.680 --> 13:16.200]  I mean, we're still arresting like half a million or more people a year for cannabis
[13:16.200 --> 13:25.160]  crimes. And that's like growing, moving, consuming, distributing basic shit with any
[13:25.160 --> 13:28.720]  product. It's how we've been living for the last 20 years.
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.120]  It's how many law enforcement, how many law enforcement hours were required to make
[13:33.120 --> 13:34.520]  the that many. Yeah.
[13:34.720 --> 13:36.840]  What could those cops be doing with that many hours?
[13:36.840 --> 13:41.880]  That's a different episode. But still, I did the math in Colorado.
[13:41.880 --> 13:44.680]  It worked out to like entire years.
[13:45.000 --> 13:51.200]  So like a whole cop's career, you could dedicate to other stuff like the numbers get
[13:51.200 --> 13:53.760]  really big, really fast when you start doing the.
[13:53.760 --> 13:55.680]  All right. It's two hours per arrest.
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.080]  And we did 750,000 arrests this year.
[13:59.800 --> 14:02.520]  The that's a million and a half cop hours.
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.640]  And then you add in the cop, the court, the detention officer, the parole officer, the
[14:08.640 --> 14:13.800]  urine test people, the money for all of that and what we could have done with that that
[14:13.800 --> 14:16.120]  would have helped us a lot more.
[14:16.320 --> 14:23.040]  Right. Like the when you start talking to politicians that aren't interested in
[14:23.040 --> 14:27.720]  legalization or think it's a dumb idea and you start presenting some of the numbers, you
[14:27.720 --> 14:31.920]  know, well, in our state, here's how many people we arrest and here's how much that can
[14:31.920 --> 14:39.280]  cost us. And what if we use that money to unfuck the roads or build schools or do drug
[14:39.280 --> 14:46.000]  treatment or homeless outreach or clean up some of the fucking crap?
[14:46.800 --> 14:48.240]  Yeah, it gets sort of endless.
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.120]  The list of needs that your area doesn't matter where in the US you are.
[14:53.480 --> 14:55.960]  Your area needs a lot of stuff bad.
[14:56.440 --> 15:03.440]  And if you go to the city council meetings or town halls, you'll hear that continuously.
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.480]  We here's the problem.
[15:05.480 --> 15:07.720]  It's going to cost 10 bucks to fix it.
[15:08.040 --> 15:09.440]  We only have three bucks.
[15:09.800 --> 15:12.240]  Only 80 cents can go towards that problem.
[15:12.480 --> 15:14.040]  That's how everything goes.
[15:14.360 --> 15:20.080]  And if you can stand up and go, I know a way that we could bring in 40 million dollars a
[15:20.080 --> 15:23.720]  year. Everybody stops and goes, how like pot?
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.040]  And they kind of go and go, show me the numbers.
[15:27.040 --> 15:28.120]  Yeah, you do.
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.880]  And all of a sudden you've got five people who are against you this morning arguing with
[15:31.880 --> 15:33.120]  you tonight. Yep.
[15:33.800 --> 15:35.160]  Yep. How do we get it going?
[15:35.520 --> 15:38.280]  Which brings me back to write some lettuce.
[15:38.480 --> 15:44.440]  There we go. Your senators, your House of Representatives members, if you don't know who
[15:44.440 --> 15:46.640]  they are, you can Google it really fast.
[15:48.480 --> 15:50.360]  Emailing them is super easy.
[15:50.760 --> 15:53.760]  For example, I could Google John Hickenlooper.
[15:54.680 --> 15:56.000]  It would come up with his name.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.040]  It would show me he's a senator for Colorado.
[15:58.560 --> 16:00.760]  I click send him an email.
[16:00.920 --> 16:02.160]  It opens up a box.
[16:02.200 --> 16:04.400]  I just type what I want and click send.
[16:05.360 --> 16:09.880]  Hour and a half later, I get a form email back saying the office has received your
[16:09.880 --> 16:12.520]  email. Reappreciate your correspondence.
[16:13.240 --> 16:18.440]  Maybe two weeks later, you get an email from a staffer that says he's interested in
[16:18.760 --> 16:20.440]  he's interested in this issue.
[16:20.480 --> 16:22.840]  Here's how. End of email.
[16:23.120 --> 16:28.240]  It's sort of arbitrary, especially if it's just one person doing it.
[16:28.760 --> 16:34.040]  But if 10,000 people all send an email, that's what they end up talking about at every
[16:34.040 --> 16:39.320]  meeting. Was your inbox flooded with people emailing about federal legalization again?
[16:39.400 --> 16:41.760]  Yep. What do they all want?
[16:41.800 --> 16:45.920]  Well, they all say we definitely have to let everybody who's been arrested for cannabis
[16:45.920 --> 16:47.000]  crimes go.
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.840]  Let them all out. Just no parole, no probation.
[16:50.840 --> 16:52.000]  Just I'm sorry.
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.000]  So write those letters, whatever else we want to interrupt in anything you want.
[16:57.120 --> 16:59.920]  Give me five things that you want for your federal legalization.
[16:59.920 --> 17:02.480]  I'm going to interrupt you and just derail this and let's see what Mike wants.
[17:02.480 --> 17:03.720]  Five days. Yeah.
[17:03.800 --> 17:05.640]  Oh, first, let everybody go.
[17:06.000 --> 17:13.160]  Everybody you caught up in hassle over cannabis, let them go to make that not a
[17:13.160 --> 17:15.720]  probable cause for fuck all ever again.
[17:16.720 --> 17:22.520]  I never want to see another video or have an interaction with law enforcement that
[17:22.520 --> 17:24.600]  starts getting escalated with.
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.680]  I detect the smell of cannabis or I detect the smell of burning marijuana.
[17:30.280 --> 17:33.120]  Like I just I never want to hear those words ever again.
[17:34.680 --> 17:38.080]  I want to see cannabis stores in all 50 states.
[17:39.920 --> 17:45.640]  And I'd really, really, really like some of the money to go to youth programs.
[17:46.000 --> 17:47.360]  OK, that's all.
[17:47.760 --> 17:49.160]  Cool. I like that.
[17:49.560 --> 17:51.520]  I can I can respect all of that.
[17:51.800 --> 17:56.520]  I'm in just a good way to just kind of ask you what you thought federal would be
[17:56.520 --> 18:02.720]  awesome. I'm hoping like I'm really hoping places like Colorado that went overboard
[18:02.720 --> 18:08.000]  with our rules and regs dial them way back with federal legalization.
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.080]  I'm like, there's no reason we should have an eight store cap across our city.
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.000]  Right. Or a full on moratorium on new cannabis businesses in the county.
[18:18.160 --> 18:21.720]  Or 32 layers of paper packaging before I could take a dab.
[18:22.200 --> 18:27.440]  Yep. All the licensing, like some of that shit's necessary.
[18:27.440 --> 18:31.840]  Like I don't want the extraction people randomly blowing up a whole seven.
[18:31.960 --> 18:35.120]  Right. I don't want that to happen a bunch of times.
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.800]  And so let's make sure the fire department gets in there first and make sure
[18:38.800 --> 18:42.440]  everything's safe and up to code and the walls aren't fucking plyboard.
[18:42.560 --> 18:46.600]  And, you know, but for the most part.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.320]  Like, do we like tomatoes?
[18:51.440 --> 18:52.920]  Do it like craft breweries.
[18:53.200 --> 18:56.560]  That's a model I like is like craft beer or beer.
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.160]  I'd like to say it's cannabis is a flower.
[19:01.680 --> 19:04.480]  It's a medicine and it's an intoxicant.
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.760]  And we sell flowers, medicines and intoxicants every fucking day in every city, on
[19:09.760 --> 19:14.560]  every street corner. We can figure out a way to comfortably
[19:14.560 --> 19:16.880]  just produce and distribute cannabis.
[19:16.920 --> 19:20.240]  We just got to stop pretending it's that hard and just do it.
[19:20.800 --> 19:22.480]  We're pretty good at it here in Colorado, Mike.
[19:22.520 --> 19:26.760]  You and I put a lot of cannabis out, allegedly before cannabis was doing stuff.
[19:26.800 --> 19:30.480]  A lot of our alter egos may have allegedly had a lot of cannabis happening.
[19:30.480 --> 19:34.640]  And then we got in the legal market and exponentially multiplied the amount of
[19:34.640 --> 19:37.760]  cannabis we're putting out there. We had a good time in the legal market.
[19:37.880 --> 19:43.120]  The gray market in the legal markets were like when the period of time where
[19:43.120 --> 19:48.440]  states were afraid to make rules, people forget the history really fast.
[19:48.880 --> 19:57.440]  When Colorado was just medical, the feds were saying, I dare you to allow this.
[19:57.440 --> 19:58.800]  I fucking dare you.
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.080]  They were still raiding dispensaries left and right with federal agents where the
[20:04.080 --> 20:07.440]  DEA would show up and smash everything and take everything.
[20:07.440 --> 20:12.840]  And some people would end up in jail for the night and then nothing because the
[20:12.840 --> 20:15.360]  locals knew that they couldn't get a jury to convict.
[20:15.840 --> 20:18.720]  And so the feds would just seize everything and go away.
[20:18.720 --> 20:20.920]  And it was like getting robbed.
[20:20.920 --> 20:24.720]  But you couldn't call the cops because it was the federal police that robbed you.
[20:24.760 --> 20:27.200]  Yep. There was a lot of that.
[20:27.200 --> 20:33.320]  There was the drug czar of the United States saying he would take a doctor's
[20:33.320 --> 20:35.440]  ability to prescribe narcotics.
[20:35.480 --> 20:42.560]  Yeah. If that doctor talked, not recommended, not prescribed, just discussed.
[20:43.640 --> 20:48.520]  With the patient, the use of cannabis for their ailment, just discussed, just
[20:48.520 --> 20:51.640]  fucking talked about, I'm sorry for Kirsten so much this episode.
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.720]  Kirsten, your face off, dude.
[20:52.720 --> 20:54.120]  I say fuck a lot on my show.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.960]  I'm on a roll and I really missed the show.
[20:57.000 --> 20:57.440]  You keep rolling.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.960]  I've got questions and I've abandoned them.
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.760]  You're just doing your thing and I like it.
[21:00.760 --> 21:02.400]  I'm going to go out and smoke this bowl.
[21:04.320 --> 21:07.000]  We really have a shot right now.
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.640]  And if everybody is super easy, all I got to do is shoot off a couple of emails.
[21:11.640 --> 21:14.280]  You can do it as stone as you'd like to be.
[21:14.280 --> 21:20.240]  You can include I'd really like you to add this to the legalization proposal or
[21:20.240 --> 21:22.240]  I'd really like you to stay away from this.
[21:22.960 --> 21:24.480]  Anything you want.
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.560]  Just please email your elected representative state federal, all of them,
[21:29.560 --> 21:32.760]  especially if you're still in a prohibition state.
[21:32.760 --> 21:37.920]  There's a lot of places where cannabis is just as illegal as it was when we were
[21:37.920 --> 21:40.240]  teenagers and that's crazy.
[21:40.480 --> 21:42.000]  It's 2021.
[21:42.480 --> 21:47.920]  The fact that some people can drive to the corner store and grab an ounce of
[21:47.920 --> 21:55.760]  herb and go home and other people can go to jail for decades for having that
[21:55.760 --> 21:57.240]  ounce for sale is just insane.
[21:57.760 --> 21:57.960]  Yeah.
[21:58.480 --> 22:01.680]  Three grams of the finest concentrates on the planet right here in front of me.
[22:01.680 --> 22:07.920]  And if we drove 10 hours that way, this would be completely, completely a major
[22:07.920 --> 22:08.320]  crime.
[22:09.120 --> 22:14.440]  And if if you all start having these discussions, conversations with elected
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.160]  representatives in your area and you get any pushback, by all means, send the show
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.160]  an email and we'll do episodes on, oh, they said this.
[22:23.280 --> 22:23.920]  Tell them that.
[22:24.280 --> 22:24.960]  Yeah, there we go.
[22:25.440 --> 22:26.080]  Mike's rebuttal.
[22:26.080 --> 22:27.080]  That's my wheelhouse.
[22:27.360 --> 22:28.480]  That's what I love to do.
[22:28.480 --> 22:33.200]  That's what I did for a living for a long time before COVID made me a hermit.
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.520]  All of us are hermits now, bro.
[22:35.520 --> 22:36.640]  COVID did that to us.
[22:36.640 --> 22:37.160]  I know.
[22:39.120 --> 22:42.320]  Some of us embraced it and made a video podcast for our folks.
[22:44.760 --> 22:46.200]  You definitely embraced it.
[22:46.200 --> 22:48.200]  The new studio space is amazing.
[22:48.200 --> 22:48.560]  Thank you.
[22:48.560 --> 22:50.600]  There's a little aside.
[22:50.600 --> 22:54.840]  Y'all got over there to check it out recently and it's fantastic.
[22:55.480 --> 22:56.000]  Thank you, bro.
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.840]  I want to put another microphone on the other side here as soon as we're allowed
[22:58.840 --> 22:59.560]  to play together.
[22:59.920 --> 23:01.680]  I'll get another one of these Joe Rogan mics.
[23:01.680 --> 23:04.200]  His crazy ass wants to get me over there in 4K.
[23:04.200 --> 23:05.280]  Y'all, I am not ready.
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.600]  Yeah, you're ready, bro.
[23:06.600 --> 23:06.920]  Don't worry.
[23:06.920 --> 23:07.720]  You look good right there.
[23:07.720 --> 23:08.720]  No one's going to say anything.
[23:10.240 --> 23:13.680]  And if they do now, whatever, we'll acknowledge them.
[23:14.880 --> 23:17.200]  This is the best part about the Internet, man, all the haters.
[23:17.640 --> 23:18.040]  Yeah.
[23:18.720 --> 23:19.800]  Shout out to the haters.
[23:19.800 --> 23:20.480]  You know who you are.
[23:21.600 --> 23:22.120]  All right, Mike.
[23:22.720 --> 23:24.240]  Let's put the show back on track.
[23:24.240 --> 23:25.400]  I do have a bunch of questions.
[23:25.680 --> 23:27.400]  Anything you want to just keep ranting on?
[23:27.400 --> 23:29.240]  Do you want to keep going or do you want me to try to throw
[23:29.240 --> 23:30.440]  all these questions at you?
[23:30.440 --> 23:33.960]  I when I apologize for cursing, I sort of lost the thread
[23:33.960 --> 23:36.200]  and then I took another hit off the span and now we're here.
[23:36.440 --> 23:39.120]  Yeah, I took a hit off my bowl here and got lost as well.
[23:39.120 --> 23:40.400]  That's why we're trying to regroup now here.
[23:40.400 --> 23:40.880]  Reload.
[23:40.880 --> 23:43.560]  And so I know everything is up in the air.
[23:43.560 --> 23:44.600]  Nothing has been solved.
[23:44.600 --> 23:46.960]  There's no real fucking rules.
[23:46.960 --> 23:49.120]  There's not even a proposal or a bill yet.
[23:49.120 --> 23:49.440]  Yeah.
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.080]  As that paranoid guy who has always been like,
[23:53.480 --> 23:56.880]  I liked the black market because I thought when I knew that
[23:56.880 --> 24:01.240]  when legalization came here in Colorado, that it would be cool at first
[24:01.240 --> 24:03.240]  and then it would be overregulated, man.
[24:03.240 --> 24:04.520]  And that's the word we all like to use.
[24:04.520 --> 24:06.600]  It's just the paranoid conspiracy theory.
[24:06.600 --> 24:07.840]  Fucking wookie inside of me.
[24:07.840 --> 24:08.840]  Straight up what we did.
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.040]  That's an accurate description of life in Colorado's cannabis market.
[24:13.160 --> 24:14.720]  Well, no, I'm paranoid.
[24:14.720 --> 24:18.760]  And do you think that I've got two questions here this could go to?
[24:19.360 --> 24:22.680]  Do you think this will be the lead to like the dispensary
[24:22.880 --> 24:26.880]  taking over the dispensaries and the grows and the entire cannabis market?
[24:26.880 --> 24:30.200]  And then that will lead to who we will consider the devil of cannabis.
[24:30.200 --> 24:33.600]  Do you think that will be Monsanto getting in to grow the cannabis
[24:33.600 --> 24:35.480]  for the government? That's my paranoia.
[24:37.280 --> 24:39.160]  Well, the government already grows cannabis.
[24:39.160 --> 24:41.280]  They like the University of Mississippi.
[24:41.280 --> 24:43.320]  Have you seen the shit that they grow there, dude?
[24:43.320 --> 24:44.360]  That stuff is terrible.
[24:44.360 --> 24:46.440]  Yo, you people, the University of Mississippi,
[24:46.440 --> 24:48.360]  if you would like some lessons on how to grow quality cannabis,
[24:48.360 --> 24:51.360]  I've seen your gardens, I've seen what you do, but that's fucking.
[24:51.360 --> 24:52.640]  We can help.
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.720]  I can absolutely step up your game.
[24:54.720 --> 24:56.600]  I wouldn't even charge you. I just want credit.
[24:56.600 --> 24:58.320]  You paid for me to get there.
[24:58.320 --> 25:01.320]  I'll come increase your fucking total production.
[25:01.320 --> 25:04.400]  Everything will be 70 percent better by the time I leave.
[25:04.400 --> 25:06.080]  I don't even want any pay. I want full credit.
[25:06.080 --> 25:09.040]  Maybe we'll do a podcast, maybe run some cameras through that bitch
[25:09.040 --> 25:10.400]  or something just to show that I was there.
[25:10.400 --> 25:10.800]  You know what I mean?
[25:10.800 --> 25:12.400]  That's all I just want the credit.
[25:12.400 --> 25:14.360]  But just a sub to the song.
[25:14.360 --> 25:15.800]  Your weed sucks, dude.
[25:15.800 --> 25:19.240]  I may need to bring Mike as my backup guy to take notes and help me out.
[25:19.240 --> 25:21.320]  And should he's my handler because I've got this ADD issue.
[25:21.320 --> 25:25.200]  But you're going to need someone like me to explain to the government.
[25:25.200 --> 25:26.320]  You're not to be arrested.
[25:26.320 --> 25:27.160]  That's the truth.
[25:27.160 --> 25:28.920]  I got to bring Mike as my legal backup.
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.240]  But you guys hire me. I'll help you out.
[25:30.240 --> 25:31.160]  All right, Mike, let's keep going.
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.360]  Now, the government does grow weed, but that shit sucks.
[25:33.360 --> 25:34.120]  And they need fucking help.
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.240]  It's super bad.
[25:35.240 --> 25:36.400]  It's it's so bad.
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.000]  I almost think it's a ploy.
[25:39.480 --> 25:42.480]  Like they have to keep giving researchers dog food
[25:42.480 --> 25:46.160]  because if they had real product, they would see the medical benefits
[25:46.160 --> 25:47.920]  like the rest of us do. Right.
[25:49.760 --> 25:51.680]  But they're straight up cutting plants out of the ground
[25:51.680 --> 25:54.240]  and shoving them through wood chippers and calling that fine herb.
[25:56.120 --> 25:57.320]  I know a shop that does that.
[25:57.320 --> 26:00.560]  So I wish that was an exaggeration or hyperbole.
[26:03.280 --> 26:08.640]  But the major corporations will 100 percent get involved.
[26:08.640 --> 26:10.880]  They already are in Canada in a major way.
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.880]  That was going to be my next question.
[26:12.880 --> 26:16.400]  Marlboro is really a company called Altria.
[26:17.720 --> 26:22.120]  And they already have a substantial investment in Canada.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.520]  I want to say it's Budweiser.
[26:26.520 --> 26:29.000]  It might be a different beer of their tier, though.
[26:29.640 --> 26:33.760]  I don't pay too much attention to Canada, Canada, marijuana investments,
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.200]  but the anti cannabis crowd often references these,
[26:38.200 --> 26:40.080]  which is why I know it is a talking point.
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.480]  But expect all of them to jump in.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.800]  Personally, I'm not worried because I know a couple of things
[26:48.800 --> 26:51.640]  about cannabis that they don't.
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.840]  One of those things is if you get the THC percentage above
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.520]  a certain point, it will fuck up a mass production rolling machine
[27:00.520 --> 27:01.600]  like you will not believe.
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.640]  Oh, yeah. Cannabis and tobacco are wildly different plants.
[27:06.360 --> 27:09.800]  People that don't consume either assume they're the same
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.200]  with just slightly different effects as a lover of both.
[27:15.320 --> 27:18.080]  They are wildly different.
[27:18.080 --> 27:22.440]  And the production and distribution of them is also wildly different
[27:22.440 --> 27:23.440]  because of that.
[27:23.440 --> 27:26.280]  And that's a good time to interrupt you and congratulate you on a year
[27:26.280 --> 27:27.760]  of being cigarette free, bro.
[27:27.760 --> 27:31.520]  I didn't tell you that you're in some days now, but thank you very much.
[27:31.680 --> 27:35.200]  I'm so proud I've made it this far with zero tobacco, no blunt wraps,
[27:35.200 --> 27:36.880]  no vapes, no nothing.
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.120]  Congrats, bro. Good job.
[27:38.120 --> 27:40.800]  Really, that that does mean a lot to a lot of people out there. Good job.
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.400]  And if you're curious, cannabis world, I can take way better hits.
[27:46.800 --> 27:48.960]  Yeah. These pens.
[27:49.640 --> 27:54.880]  I used to get like a tiny little your drinks way too hot level
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.880]  sip out of them.
[27:56.880 --> 28:01.200]  And then I would cough like I was trying to cough up a lung.
[28:01.240 --> 28:02.360]  It was so bad.
[28:03.800 --> 28:05.160]  I'd get ripped that way.
[28:05.160 --> 28:07.240]  It would just take 30 coughing fits.
[28:07.720 --> 28:09.760]  Now I you see me on the show.
[28:09.760 --> 28:13.080]  If you're watching on YouTube, the start of the show, you rip it continuously.
[28:13.200 --> 28:15.800]  He took a dab at the start of the show and was able to recover
[28:16.120 --> 28:19.080]  through the before I was done rambling through the intro.
[28:19.080 --> 28:20.200]  So that was impressive.
[28:20.200 --> 28:23.520]  Used to turn colors and fucking different shades of purple.
[28:24.520 --> 28:27.880]  But yeah, you can really feel how
[28:28.600 --> 28:30.880]  it in the lungs that you're off tobacco for sure.
[28:31.280 --> 28:33.320]  Congrats, buddy. I'm proud of you. I really am. Thank you.
[28:33.360 --> 28:35.440]  I know we totally derailed the show to congratulate you.
[28:35.880 --> 28:38.320]  Stroke your ego a little bit there, but I'm proud of you and excited for it.
[28:38.320 --> 28:41.360]  I mean, this had to be a Rambo cast. I was gone for too long.
[28:41.360 --> 28:43.920]  We both knew it was going to go off the rails repeatedly.
[28:43.920 --> 28:45.520]  Anybody still enjoying this?
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.760]  No, it was too. And they're cheering every time it does.
[28:47.920 --> 28:51.040]  We've been going for probably like 30 minutes or so.
[28:51.040 --> 28:51.800]  They're still listening.
[28:51.800 --> 28:54.240]  And they like it when we rambled the dab at the beginning,
[28:54.240 --> 28:56.200]  took away my ability to judge time.
[28:56.200 --> 28:59.040]  I can't tell if we've been here for five minutes or three hours.
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.280]  I've got so many timers and things happening on so many different devices here
[29:03.280 --> 29:05.120]  that it's ridiculous.
[29:05.120 --> 29:08.040]  Yeah, I was setting up for a podcast. I was like, bye. I got a camera there.
[29:08.040 --> 29:11.760]  I got a MacBook and lights and the iPad and just so many things for this show.
[29:12.120 --> 29:14.560]  And I forgot how to zoom. I haven't done a zoom show in a minute.
[29:14.560 --> 29:17.200]  It's kind of fun. All right, Mike, I want to put it back on the rails.
[29:17.520 --> 29:19.320]  What are the chances of us getting homegrows
[29:19.320 --> 29:21.760]  if they do federally legalized cannabis or do you think?
[29:21.800 --> 29:26.720]  Pretty good. OK, that's going to that would be something the feds would
[29:27.440 --> 29:29.800]  almost 100 percent leave up to the states.
[29:29.880 --> 29:30.920]  That's cool.
[29:30.920 --> 29:36.440]  And that's sort of what we want in a good federal legalization
[29:36.440 --> 29:40.680]  is a lot of their answers to questions like that are go.
[29:40.680 --> 29:42.760]  I don't fucking care. Let the states choose.
[29:43.040 --> 29:47.240]  So and so it's going to end up looking kind of like the liquor market.
[29:47.240 --> 29:49.000]  If if I had to predict
[29:49.760 --> 29:54.080]  our states like Utah are much more conservative with
[29:54.680 --> 29:58.240]  who can produce it, who can ship it, who can sell it.
[29:58.720 --> 30:01.320]  And states like
[30:02.200 --> 30:05.960]  Louisiana can be much more liberal
[30:05.960 --> 30:09.440]  with who can grow it, sell it, distribute it, all of that.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.400]  It just depends on where you are and what the locals want.
[30:13.680 --> 30:17.480]  Personally, I'd I'd really like to see it like the craft beer industry.
[30:17.480 --> 30:22.440]  Anybody with like a grand and some good credit can get started in the industry.
[30:22.440 --> 30:24.880]  I'd love to it to be at that level.
[30:25.680 --> 30:28.120]  But like, I really think it needs inspections and shit.
[30:28.120 --> 30:30.840]  I don't know how many people that listen to this show saw.
[30:30.840 --> 30:33.520]  There was a big report on baby food that just came out.
[30:34.440 --> 30:38.440]  And if you if you think, oh, baby food, like if you sell baby food,
[30:38.480 --> 30:41.320]  that's your bread and butter, like you really give a shit about what's in your
[30:41.320 --> 30:43.560]  product, but they're big business.
[30:43.600 --> 30:46.160]  So guess what? They care about money.
[30:47.240 --> 30:48.640]  And that's all they care about.
[30:48.640 --> 30:51.280]  And it turns out that they've been feeding kids horrible things
[30:51.280 --> 30:52.800]  for a long time and getting away with it
[30:55.080 --> 30:57.200]  because it's profitable to do so.
[30:57.200 --> 31:00.120]  And so if the baby food company is going to put shit in their food
[31:00.120 --> 31:03.520]  and sell it to you, the cannabis company is going to do it.
[31:04.040 --> 31:07.280]  Yeah. And as much as I'd
[31:08.120 --> 31:12.120]  I always pretended when it was the black market that, oh, yeah,
[31:12.160 --> 31:15.400]  this dude's all organic, like it's totally hippie grown.
[31:15.880 --> 31:19.040]  And it was all just a marketing thing that I was told by whoever happened
[31:19.040 --> 31:20.520]  to be selling it to me that time.
[31:21.960 --> 31:24.960]  And it was a comforting lie that we all like to tell each other and believe.
[31:24.960 --> 31:26.680]  But it was always bullshit.
[31:26.720 --> 31:29.440]  Like any time you went to the grocery store and asked a question,
[31:29.440 --> 31:32.560]  they were like, oh, spray this toxic shit on it and you'll be fine.
[31:32.600 --> 31:34.080]  Yeah. No, you don't.
[31:34.080 --> 31:35.680]  They don't even mention PPE.
[31:35.680 --> 31:37.520]  I was going to say, dude, I went there was a grocery store.
[31:37.520 --> 31:40.440]  I won't mention them, but they recommended me probably 20 different products,
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.960]  sold them to me 20 different times.
[31:41.960 --> 31:43.200]  Never once told me.
[31:43.200 --> 31:46.560]  Never tried to sell me gloves, a mask, a respirator, a Tyvek suit.
[31:46.560 --> 31:47.840]  Never. Just a bunch of different.
[31:47.840 --> 31:51.400]  Not only is that wildly irresponsible, that's just shitty salesmanship.
[31:51.600 --> 31:55.800]  Yeah. Like if it comes in a three piece set, sell the three piece set.
[31:56.440 --> 32:00.040]  So, Mike, will this be legalization or decriminalization
[32:00.040 --> 32:02.120]  if we get this federal movement here?
[32:02.120 --> 32:04.560]  Totally up in the air still. OK. All right.
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.640]  My guess is if it moves forward at all,
[32:08.320 --> 32:12.920]  it will be a half step or a quarter step like federal decriminalization,
[32:14.120 --> 32:17.560]  which honestly wouldn't be that bad if the feds just said we're out of it.
[32:18.040 --> 32:20.800]  I'd really like the feds not to special tax it.
[32:21.680 --> 32:22.160]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[32:22.160 --> 32:24.680]  They just did a regular tax level on it.
[32:24.680 --> 32:27.320]  They didn't add anything because it was cannabis. That'd be great.
[32:28.480 --> 32:30.880]  Colorado went way heavy on the taxes.
[32:30.880 --> 32:33.720]  Yeah. A lot of places went worse, but.
[32:34.040 --> 32:36.400]  What keeps the black market thriving when you overtax it?
[32:36.400 --> 32:38.160]  It keeps the free market the free market.
[32:38.160 --> 32:40.040]  There's no taxes there.
[32:40.520 --> 32:43.040]  One of my questions was and I know this isn't going to happen like
[32:43.640 --> 32:44.760]  you don't know what's going to happen.
[32:44.760 --> 32:45.680]  This is still up in the air.
[32:45.680 --> 32:50.480]  But what do you think this will do for legal, for medical and recreational lead?
[32:51.480 --> 32:53.280]  Huge leaps forward.
[32:53.280 --> 32:55.760]  OK, well, there still be two different markets,
[32:55.760 --> 32:57.920]  or do you think it all just become weed?
[32:57.960 --> 33:00.000]  It'll be it'll end up evening out.
[33:02.200 --> 33:05.840]  One of the things I really, really look forward to
[33:06.400 --> 33:10.720]  is there are a bunch of people in my life that are like 65 plus,
[33:11.400 --> 33:15.560]  and only a few of them were cannabis friendly in their youth.
[33:15.600 --> 33:22.160]  Most of them, it was literally a blockade to financial
[33:23.240 --> 33:25.200]  stability for a lot of them.
[33:25.200 --> 33:28.640]  And so they just chose to not to pretend like it didn't exist
[33:28.640 --> 33:31.960]  from the time they were 19 until they were in their 60s and 70s.
[33:32.440 --> 33:34.480]  And a doctor brought it up.
[33:34.480 --> 33:40.800]  And so. Federal legalization is going to lead to clinical trials
[33:40.800 --> 33:44.800]  that lead to them getting far superior medicines.
[33:46.280 --> 33:49.400]  And that might just mean
[33:50.560 --> 33:55.000]  go get a gummy that's five milligrams, THC, 50 milligrams CBD.
[33:55.000 --> 33:55.600]  You know what I mean?
[33:55.600 --> 33:58.960]  It might not be go get Prozac or whatever.
[33:58.960 --> 34:02.280]  The cannabis drug name ends up being Maranol
[34:03.640 --> 34:06.320]  is the terrible one now, but.
[34:08.080 --> 34:12.040]  That's really exciting, and so that aspect of the medical market
[34:12.040 --> 34:13.960]  is definitely going to stick around.
[34:13.960 --> 34:16.200]  I don't think it will be
[34:16.200 --> 34:19.640]  half separated like it always has been here in Colorado, where
[34:20.600 --> 34:23.520]  you have to get a MedCard to shop in this particular market.
[34:23.560 --> 34:26.320]  I think the production and distribution
[34:26.720 --> 34:29.080]  pieces will blend completely together.
[34:29.400 --> 34:31.640]  All right. That's kind of what I prefer having them separate here
[34:31.640 --> 34:33.800]  is just silly and annoying.
[34:33.800 --> 34:35.200]  It's a way to
[34:35.320 --> 34:38.200]  the excuse was to make sure that the patients got their medicine
[34:38.200 --> 34:40.600]  and that the rest was available for recreational users
[34:40.600 --> 34:43.160]  so that they were always taken care of. But.
[34:43.160 --> 34:45.280]  It made a lot of sense, and we didn't.
[34:46.920 --> 34:51.640]  It's not like we're casting a magic spell and just starting from where we are.
[34:52.240 --> 34:55.080]  It's first we had full prohibition
[34:55.080 --> 34:57.960]  and then we were medical with no rules for a long time.
[34:57.960 --> 34:59.760]  And now we're here.
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.200]  And we had to respect that that process happened as it advanced.
[35:04.720 --> 35:07.680]  And so keeping the two markets separate made a lot of sense.
[35:07.680 --> 35:11.280]  But if it's legal in all 50 states, to some degree,
[35:11.560 --> 35:14.920]  having it separated like we do here in Colorado doesn't make a lot of sense.
[35:16.240 --> 35:21.040]  Especially when a lot of the rules here in Colorado get reexamined,
[35:21.520 --> 35:24.160]  because right now the rules are wildly different,
[35:24.160 --> 35:26.560]  and that's why there's still a medical market at all.
[35:29.640 --> 35:31.960]  Yet way different, isn't it weird?
[35:31.960 --> 35:35.160]  I can't get I'm currently without a medical cannabis card.
[35:35.160 --> 35:36.880]  I just I've been so busy.
[35:36.880 --> 35:39.040]  I have sort of just to say I can get it.
[35:39.040 --> 35:42.000]  I definitely haven't been able to get to a doctor's appointment like that.
[35:42.280 --> 35:45.280]  I can get in stores you can't get into just because I've got this little
[35:45.400 --> 35:46.440]  it's not even a paper now.
[35:46.440 --> 35:48.080]  It's a fucking PDF on my phone.
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.720]  So I've been playing with a lot of edibles, and I have to eat
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.320]  a larger physical quantity of the products to get the dosage.
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.600]  Then you can medically. It's just silly.
[35:59.640 --> 36:02.640]  Yeah, that hundred milligram at the rec stores and eight grams
[36:02.640 --> 36:03.880]  of concentrates is the limit.
[36:03.880 --> 36:08.840]  So I can get four edibles and four grams or eight concentrates or eight edibles.
[36:08.840 --> 36:09.800]  But that's all I can.
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.880]  And I know a lot of people are going, well, dude, that's a lot of shit.
[36:11.920 --> 36:14.120]  Yeah, but what if I just want to go once a week?
[36:14.120 --> 36:16.120]  Then that's that's my weekly allowance.
[36:16.120 --> 36:19.840]  And then if anybody comes over and you come, dad, the limits at all,
[36:19.840 --> 36:23.840]  I think are going away because the limits aren't there.
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.080]  For any logical reason, once it's cannabis is legal
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.000]  in all 50 states and available in all 50 states, right?
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.040]  Like the limits meant to keeping you from buying a hundred of everything
[36:36.040 --> 36:38.440]  and taking them to Arkansas and selling them.
[36:38.520 --> 36:41.320]  Yeah, but if there's already stores in Arkansas
[36:41.320 --> 36:44.440]  that have the same shit on the shelf for roughly the same price,
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.880]  that's not a job anymore.
[36:46.880 --> 36:51.720]  And so the rules that make that job harder can all go away.
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.560]  I'd like them to keep some of the rules because a lot of them are good.
[36:57.800 --> 36:59.480]  Some of them make sense.
[36:59.480 --> 37:01.680]  If you look at the
[37:03.040 --> 37:05.480]  robbery data, at least this was true.
[37:05.480 --> 37:08.480]  It's probably still true because the reasons it was true before
[37:08.480 --> 37:09.360]  made a lot of sense.
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.600]  I just haven't checked in like the last year and a half.
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.080]  But cannabis businesses get robbed way less than like banks,
[37:17.080 --> 37:19.000]  gas stations, liquor stores,
[37:21.080 --> 37:22.520]  JCPenney's.
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.880]  And it's because part of legalization was you have to put cameras everywhere.
[37:26.880 --> 37:28.680]  There have to be cameras everywhere.
[37:28.680 --> 37:29.800]  There are so many cameras.
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.880]  And then when you pull up to the store, it's like, smile, you're on high def camera.
[37:34.080 --> 37:36.120]  Yeah, we've been able to.
[37:36.120 --> 37:37.200]  Yeah, you can look.
[37:37.200 --> 37:40.520]  So if somebody is in the parking lot smoking in the dispensary parking lot,
[37:40.520 --> 37:41.400]  they're smoking a cigarette.
[37:41.400 --> 37:43.920]  We can zoom in and see if it's a cigarette or a joint.
[37:43.920 --> 37:47.480]  We're able to look very closely from just inside the store
[37:47.480 --> 37:49.440]  just by zooming in to see what you're smoking out there.
[37:49.440 --> 37:51.800]  So be careful. Don't get yourself or us in trouble, please.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.320]  And that's like that rule is annoying as a prospective business owner
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.840]  because the infrastructure for that kind of system is pricey
[38:02.600 --> 38:05.240]  and it's an added cost to a new business.
[38:05.240 --> 38:08.720]  But from the security standpoint and from a
[38:09.360 --> 38:12.720]  it really helped us push legalization forward because Colorado
[38:12.720 --> 38:16.120]  and Washington did shit like this and it kept the robbery numbers down.
[38:16.160 --> 38:18.120]  Yeah, that's seed to sale and all the cameras.
[38:18.120 --> 38:21.400]  And there's a security guard, an armed security guard at most dispensaries.
[38:22.080 --> 38:24.240]  All the pieces matter.
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.520]  I think a lot of the necessity for the armed security guard is going to go away.
[38:28.640 --> 38:33.480]  Part of the reason cannabis costs so much is because it's not legal everywhere.
[38:33.480 --> 38:37.080]  Yes. And the prohibition markup is massive.
[38:37.440 --> 38:40.840]  Yep. And now that it's not illegal, there's no reason for it to be expensive.
[38:40.840 --> 38:43.880]  Tomatoes aren't expensive because we could just have them grow them,
[38:44.280 --> 38:45.800]  toss them at people.
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.400]  And I mean, just like everything else, there's a price that
[38:50.120 --> 38:53.880]  all the steak we can produce gets sold at because it's reasonable.
[38:53.880 --> 38:56.280]  And same thing with cars and shoes and everything else.
[38:56.320 --> 38:58.320]  And it's the same thing with cannabis.
[38:58.320 --> 39:02.960]  It's there's going to be a price fluctuation that's wild for a while
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.960]  and then it'll settle out.
[39:04.960 --> 39:08.960]  And that'll be, you know, the people that produce cannabis
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.280]  produce this much and the people that consume consume this much.
[39:12.280 --> 39:15.400]  And this is how much money changes hands.
[39:15.760 --> 39:18.680]  And I think a lot of people are going to be happy to shit with that system.
[39:18.680 --> 39:20.680]  I think a lot of existing.
[39:20.680 --> 39:21.960]  I never thought we would get here.
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.000]  I'm kind of blown away that the last couple of months have played out like that.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  It's exciting, dude. It's been an exciting time.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.480]  The past, just everything going on has been exciting.
[39:29.480 --> 39:31.480]  Do you think we'll see a decline in sales?
[39:31.480 --> 39:34.200]  Do you think we'll see a decline in sales in legal states?
[39:34.200 --> 39:35.480]  Because the other states will have it.
[39:35.480 --> 39:39.240]  I mean, we're not going to sell as much because Texas will be coming to get it.
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.400]  And Missouri won't be coming to get it.
[39:41.400 --> 39:42.280]  They're already legal now.
[39:42.280 --> 39:45.400]  A lot of them aren't going to produce it, though.
[39:45.400 --> 39:47.400]  OK.
[39:47.400 --> 39:49.400]  It's sort of like everything else.
[39:49.400 --> 39:53.400]  There's a place that grows oranges and a place that grows potatoes.
[39:53.480 --> 39:57.480]  And a place that grows pineapples and places that are known for wine.
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.760]  And Colorado and Oregon, Washington, California.
[40:04.120 --> 40:05.960]  We've already got a foothold.
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.680]  And like, good luck fucking finding an affording grow space in Manhattan.
[40:10.680 --> 40:11.640]  Yeah, that's very true.
[40:12.280 --> 40:18.280]  But for a really reasonable price, I can ship container loads of cannabis to Manhattan.
[40:18.680 --> 40:22.680]  And I bet my shipping price is lower than your grow cost.
[40:22.680 --> 40:23.400]  All right.
[40:23.400 --> 40:25.800]  And I think that's going to be true in a lot of places.
[40:27.640 --> 40:30.200]  I think a lot of cannabis is headed outdoors.
[40:30.200 --> 40:31.880]  And I'm really excited about that.
[40:31.880 --> 40:39.640]  Because one of the downsides to legalization was we finally got to see the power consumption.
[40:40.680 --> 40:43.880]  Like when everybody moved into giant warehouses in Denver,
[40:44.360 --> 40:52.760]  they had been very closely monitoring their power consumption on a couple of green energy initiatives.
[40:53.320 --> 41:00.440]  And when legalization hit and the building boom took place, those numbers skyrocketed.
[41:01.400 --> 41:05.880]  And it was funny because nobody understood what was happening for a minute because nobody
[41:05.880 --> 41:09.000]  really believed the cannabis market was that big.
[41:09.720 --> 41:14.760]  It's funny, the DEA has been telling people about it every year since we were teenagers.
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.040]  But no one listened or no one really understood the numbers.
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.320]  When you say stuff like 40 billion, it's so big, people can't comprehend it.
[41:23.880 --> 41:27.080]  And so they just sort of nod along when the number gets that big.
[41:27.800 --> 41:32.200]  But when you really do the math and think about it, it gets astronomical quick.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.280]  And we blew...
[41:35.400 --> 41:38.760]  How many Transformers in Colorado blew up the next two years?
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.800]  How many blew up behind a cultivation that we managed?
[41:42.360 --> 41:43.720]  Oh, excuse me, I'm burping.
[41:43.720 --> 41:44.680]  I need to dab burp.
[41:46.920 --> 41:48.520]  It was just common for a while.
[41:48.520 --> 41:55.800]  Colorado had to really increase its infrastructure and improve our electrical grid because of all
[41:55.800 --> 41:56.760]  the extra demand.
[41:57.560 --> 42:00.920]  And I'm kind of excited to see a lot of that move outdoors.
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.240]  A lot of that move to greenhouses, hoop houses.
[42:04.360 --> 42:07.640]  Being around all of that electricity, I think I can feel it.
[42:07.640 --> 42:13.000]  When I walk toward the grow buildings that have 100, 250, 500 lights.
[42:13.000 --> 42:21.480]  So there's 250,000 watts of flowering lights in there, plus what, fucking 30, 60, 90, 120
[42:21.480 --> 42:26.200]  tons of fucking cooling on the roof, plus all the fans, plus all the moving fucking
[42:26.200 --> 42:27.480]  watering pumps and shit.
[42:27.480 --> 42:29.160]  There's a lot you can feel.
[42:29.160 --> 42:31.240]  I like to be able to feel the plant energy a little bit.
[42:31.240 --> 42:33.240]  When you walk in there, you don't feel that at all.
[42:33.240 --> 42:35.560]  You feel Transformers and three-phase power.
[42:35.560 --> 42:36.920]  That's all you feel is hum.
[42:38.920 --> 42:44.440]  The bigger the grow gets, like outside cannabis is a cleaner.
[42:45.720 --> 42:50.840]  It takes bad shit out of the air and soil and gives us back an awesome flower.
[42:52.120 --> 42:57.720]  But inside, you're totally killing that benefit.
[42:58.920 --> 43:00.120]  It's just one of the downsides.
[43:00.120 --> 43:03.080]  I also think indoor herb tends to be a lot better.
[43:03.320 --> 43:06.360]  75.7 crops and there's no bird shit.
[43:06.360 --> 43:09.640]  We didn't get hail, rain, snow, sleet, bird shit, deer.
[43:10.520 --> 43:12.680]  Yeah, we didn't get all that random shit on there.
[43:13.880 --> 43:14.760]  John made the sun.
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.160]  And we're all trying to mimic the sun.
[43:17.160 --> 43:20.120]  We're just trying to rebuild everything inside that's already outside.
[43:20.120 --> 43:20.920]  You hang a light and you can cool it.
[43:20.920 --> 43:23.800]  And that's going to change where it's grown, how it's grown.
[43:25.640 --> 43:29.640]  There's major shockwaves that will go through the industry with federal legalization.
[43:31.720 --> 43:32.600]  Talked for a long time.
[43:32.600 --> 43:33.480]  I'm going to take a dab.
[43:34.440 --> 43:39.400]  There's the shockwaves that I'm thinking about didn't happen so much in Canada
[43:39.400 --> 43:41.400]  because Canada's frozen a lot of the year.
[43:41.960 --> 43:45.640]  And so they their outdoor growth season is specific.
[43:45.640 --> 43:46.120]  It's short.
[43:47.480 --> 43:50.760]  Indoor is definitely the way to go here in the States.
[43:50.760 --> 43:51.560]  That's not true.
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.000]  And there's a shit ton of farmland that is wrongly purposed.
[43:58.600 --> 44:01.480]  Not to mention cannabis is a very profitable crop.
[44:02.040 --> 44:05.320]  And so I'm guessing there'll be a lot of farmers that
[44:05.320 --> 44:08.200]  don't have any business getting into the cannabis industry.
[44:09.320 --> 44:12.040]  Just like there were here with business owners that bought in
[44:12.040 --> 44:15.080]  without taking the time to hire people that knew what they were doing.
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.480]  Oh, we saw the hemp industry ruin people's lives the past couple of years doing the same game.
[44:20.040 --> 44:20.280]  Yep.
[44:22.120 --> 44:28.440]  They forget that you have to cultivate a distribution market for hemp.
[44:29.080 --> 44:36.120]  It's we're already wearing all the hemp shirts we want not to be a dick about it,
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.600]  but we need more products for the hemp industry.
[44:40.600 --> 44:43.480]  But with cannabis, that market is already there.
[44:43.480 --> 44:44.760]  The demand is already there.
[44:45.320 --> 44:50.920]  And the demand is growing, especially as more medical uses get discovered
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.440]  and more people get told, hey, go try this for your ailments.
[44:54.440 --> 44:59.400]  And the stigma goes away and more people are not as afraid and they're ready to do it now.
[44:59.400 --> 45:02.680]  They're finding that as an alternative to the other medicines we talked about earlier,
[45:02.680 --> 45:05.320]  they don't have to take the chemo medicine, their other medicine,
[45:05.320 --> 45:08.200]  the one medicine that makes them shit and the other medicine that makes them
[45:08.200 --> 45:11.320]  not shit, the one that makes them pee and the other one that makes them not leak.
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.160]  You can maybe stop taking one or three of those.
[45:13.960 --> 45:14.840]  It cracks me up.
[45:17.960 --> 45:21.240]  My whole family knows that this is where I've chosen.
[45:21.240 --> 45:23.480]  This is the hill I chose to die on a long time ago.
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.440]  And for a while, like they chuckled and then they were just like,
[45:28.440 --> 45:33.320]  oh, like he could have been a banker and been super rich.
[45:33.320 --> 45:33.560]  Right.
[45:33.560 --> 45:34.840]  Instead, he did this.
[45:34.840 --> 45:35.480]  That's weird.
[45:36.520 --> 45:37.480]  But he seems happy.
[45:38.280 --> 45:44.680]  And now, like one by one, they're shooting me messages like, so I've got this thing.
[45:44.680 --> 45:49.160]  And my doctor was like, try some medical cannabis.
[45:49.160 --> 45:50.760]  And I don't know what he meant by that.
[45:50.760 --> 45:52.440]  He said, Sav, what's a Sav?
[45:53.400 --> 45:58.200]  Is it a strain or strand is what they just say.
[45:59.720 --> 46:03.240]  But I chuckled because it's happened to a half dozen of them now.
[46:03.880 --> 46:07.640]  And that market is exploding.
[46:07.640 --> 46:12.440]  If you look at the marijuana use went way up in Colorado type articles.
[46:13.000 --> 46:20.200]  When you get into the numbers, it's the over 55 crowd that just retired from a job that's
[46:20.200 --> 46:23.240]  randomly drug test or threatened to for 30 years.
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.760]  And then their doctor said, oh, yeah, that that ailment sounds miserable.
[46:28.760 --> 46:30.760]  Why don't you go smoke weed about it?
[46:30.760 --> 46:32.200]  And the symptoms will go away.
[46:33.080 --> 46:35.560]  And they tried it and now they're in love with it.
[46:36.200 --> 46:38.040]  That's where the big increases are.
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.640]  And so when that gets combined with.
[46:43.320 --> 46:49.160]  Outdoor growing and all 50 states coming online, the last of them coming online,
[46:49.160 --> 46:53.080]  kind of at the same time, those shock waves are going to ripple for a while.
[46:53.080 --> 46:53.880]  You all.
[46:53.880 --> 46:57.960]  Oh, I love the I love the little old lady that just discovered cannabis.
[46:57.960 --> 46:59.160]  She's like a cute old lady.
[46:59.160 --> 47:02.920]  And she's like, my doctor showed me how to smoke weed or told me to smoke weed.
[47:02.920 --> 47:03.880]  And so I bought some.
[47:03.880 --> 47:07.240]  And like when I was a buttender and worked at the dispensary, those are my favorites.
[47:07.960 --> 47:12.520]  We're so enthusiastic about cannabis and they're like kind of secretive about it because they
[47:12.520 --> 47:14.360]  don't want their nephews and uncles to know.
[47:14.360 --> 47:17.480]  But their fucking nephews and uncles shop at the same dispensary that they do.
[47:17.560 --> 47:20.600]  And they're all trying to like make sure nobody knows and shit.
[47:20.600 --> 47:23.160]  It was just I love those little old ladies that were so enthusiastic.
[47:23.160 --> 47:24.520]  And I feel so much better.
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.440]  And I eat the edibles and I rub it on my elbows and I give some to my dog.
[47:28.440 --> 47:31.880]  I used to love those little old ladies, but they were really one of my favorite customers.
[47:32.520 --> 47:37.400]  I always loved showing them around the sales floor like, oh, you don't want to smoke it.
[47:37.400 --> 47:37.960]  You can eat it.
[47:37.960 --> 47:38.680]  You don't want to eat it.
[47:38.680 --> 47:40.360]  You can rub it into your shoulder.
[47:40.360 --> 47:40.860]  Yep.
[47:42.200 --> 47:43.880]  Yeah, we have it in an ice cream.
[47:43.880 --> 47:46.040]  Like it was just fun to kind of take them around.
[47:46.760 --> 47:51.240]  But I always my mind always goes back to there was a documentary or.
[47:53.480 --> 47:57.720]  I think it was a documentary where they followed around.
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.920]  It might have been one of the Sanjay Gupta specials.
[48:02.520 --> 48:06.760]  A couple of patients that were trying out medical cannabis for the first time.
[48:06.760 --> 48:12.040]  And one of them was like this 50s or 60s veteran, I think Navy vet.
[48:13.000 --> 48:18.680]  And he went to the dispensary and bought like an eighth and bought a glass pipe.
[48:18.680 --> 48:19.480]  I know where you're going with that.
[48:19.480 --> 48:25.000]  And went home and sat down on the couch and like just ripped
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.480]  a chunk off the top of the bud and stuffed it in the pipe and then tried to light it
[48:31.480 --> 48:36.600]  from underneath and like to cook it from underneath and kept burning his hand.
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.160]  For three or four times in the whole time I'm watching this,
[48:41.160 --> 48:46.600]  I'm fucking horrified because there's no way in hell that if that guy hasn't been
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.400]  around cannabis that much for real, that the cameraman statistically.
[48:53.640 --> 48:58.520]  If that guy was that clueless, there's no way the cameraman was also that clueless.
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.440]  It's just not statistically possible.
[49:00.440 --> 49:02.440]  And the camera is not supposed to get involved.
[49:02.440 --> 49:05.400]  And that dude was that's how you smoke other drugs, bro.
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.600]  The way that guy was lighting that.
[49:06.600 --> 49:08.280]  So he's been a drug.
[49:08.760 --> 49:11.240]  Yeah, was kind of my guess.
[49:11.240 --> 49:15.640]  But if you've been around something that you consume that way,
[49:15.640 --> 49:18.760]  how the fuck do you not know how to hit a bowl of weed?
[49:18.760 --> 49:19.080]  Right.
[49:19.080 --> 49:20.680]  How is that possible?
[49:20.680 --> 49:22.760]  I've seen that documentary and I laughed at that, too.
[49:22.760 --> 49:24.200]  And I was like, that guy does other drugs.
[49:24.200 --> 49:25.000]  That's what I like.
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  His fourth hit, he gets it right.
[49:27.880 --> 49:31.880]  And my guess was that they show the lighting of the pipe from underneath
[49:31.880 --> 49:34.120]  and a couple of anti-drug images.
[49:35.960 --> 49:36.680]  But.
[49:36.680 --> 49:37.880]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[49:37.880 --> 49:41.800]  When older people would come in, I would always sort of like,
[49:42.440 --> 49:46.120]  so what's your familiarity level with the plant?
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.680]  Like, please tell me so that I know who I'm dealing with and I can appropriately educate
[49:50.680 --> 49:53.560]  you so that you don't hurt yourself or someone else.
[49:54.760 --> 50:00.520]  Like, don't burn your hand or eat two chocolate bars and get behind the line.
[50:01.720 --> 50:05.000]  Or try to just do anything after two of those chocolate bars.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.840]  All right, Mike, I do need to start wrapping up the show here.
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.120]  We've been going for close to an hour, but I've got one more question on my list of
[50:10.840 --> 50:13.640]  federal legalization topics here.
[50:13.640 --> 50:14.840]  Write your senators, you guys.
[50:14.840 --> 50:17.000]  Yes, please do write your senators.
[50:17.000 --> 50:18.680]  Write them again.
[50:18.680 --> 50:22.280]  Write them once a month, maybe once every two weeks and let them know that you do support
[50:22.280 --> 50:24.680]  the federal legalization of cannabis.
[50:24.680 --> 50:25.560]  Let's do it.
[50:25.560 --> 50:26.280]  Be professional.
[50:26.280 --> 50:26.760]  Don't curse.
[50:26.760 --> 50:27.960]  Don't use profanity.
[50:27.960 --> 50:29.800]  Just kindly, just politely let them know.
[50:29.800 --> 50:34.920]  Hey, my name is Rasta Jeff and I think that we should work towards federal cannabis legalization.
[50:34.920 --> 50:35.160]  Yep.
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.560]  But Mike, my question for you is, if we do have federal legalization of cannabis, does
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.480]  that mean, bro, that we get to have cannabis events again?
[50:45.480 --> 50:49.480]  Like, if it's legal, like beer, does that mean since we've got beer at the fair and
[50:49.480 --> 50:50.840]  there's bars on every corner?
[50:50.840 --> 50:51.640]  It depends.
[50:51.640 --> 50:52.520]  Oh man, come on.
[50:52.520 --> 50:56.760]  I just want you to tell me, yes, that one of these days we can go smoke at a place with
[50:56.760 --> 50:57.400]  friends again.
[50:58.120 --> 50:58.200]  I want it so bad.
[50:58.200 --> 50:59.880]  I was just having hopes and dreams.
[50:59.880 --> 51:00.120]  Yeah.
[51:01.080 --> 51:11.480]  Colorado before the pandemic was in the process of discussing rules and regulations for consumption
[51:11.480 --> 51:16.120]  clubs and had just started issuing licenses.
[51:16.840 --> 51:23.160]  And then everybody just hit a big red stop on all of that because it doesn't make sense
[51:24.120 --> 51:29.800]  to be licensing businesses where you can go consume cannabis with your friends.
[51:29.800 --> 51:33.240]  If you can't go to businesses or be with your friends.
[51:33.880 --> 51:34.120]  Yeah.
[51:35.240 --> 51:39.000]  It sucks because they hit pause, but it made sense.
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.520]  Like there's other shit on their plate and the way small businesses are right now.
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.840]  Can you imagine just paying rent?
[51:46.840 --> 51:47.800]  Oh, hell no.
[51:47.800 --> 51:52.920]  Until this is over for a business that hasn't even had a chance to open yet.
[51:53.640 --> 51:56.040]  And won't until this is totally over.
[51:56.040 --> 51:57.240]  It would be closed by now.
[51:57.800 --> 51:57.960]  Yeah.
[51:57.960 --> 51:58.840]  And it'd be bankrupt.
[51:59.480 --> 51:59.720]  Yep.
[52:00.840 --> 52:04.680]  And apparently landlords still really want their money for retail space, which is why
[52:04.680 --> 52:05.560]  everybody's closing.
[52:05.560 --> 52:08.920]  So, but I'm desperate for it.
[52:08.920 --> 52:10.680]  I want cannabis cups.
[52:10.680 --> 52:11.880]  I want Kush cons.
[52:11.880 --> 52:13.480]  I want Indo Expos.
[52:13.480 --> 52:17.880]  I want cannabis sections at County fairs.
[52:17.880 --> 52:18.280]  Yeah.
[52:18.920 --> 52:24.360]  Um, I want, I mean, everything short of science spinners.
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.320]  I want it all.
[52:25.320 --> 52:25.560]  Yeah.
[52:26.440 --> 52:27.240]  Just like we have a bar.
[52:27.240 --> 52:29.160]  There's no reason we couldn't have it.
[52:29.160 --> 52:32.680]  Just like we have a bar where we can go see some shitty classic rock band on the weekend,
[52:32.680 --> 52:37.000]  right across the street and go listen to somebody play fucking Mustang Sally and born to be wild
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.760]  and drink fucking liquor until we get fucking, until we fucking puke.
[52:40.760 --> 52:44.360]  Why can't we go somewhere right across the street and sit at a booth and fucking take
[52:44.360 --> 52:46.840]  a few dabs and listen to some Bob Marley and some fish?
[52:47.400 --> 52:49.400]  Like, I think we should all be able to have a good time.
[52:49.960 --> 52:51.720]  Does it have to be fish?
[52:51.720 --> 52:54.520]  Well, I'll let you play some three 11 on the jukebox too, bro.
[52:54.520 --> 53:00.440]  But just give me a, a, a cannabis friendly space outside.
[53:01.560 --> 53:04.280]  Um, give me, put up a roof deck.
[53:04.280 --> 53:08.200]  That's what they kept talking about in Denver, because apparently, I don't know if, I don't
[53:08.200 --> 53:12.920]  know if the listeners are aware, but if you see somebody smoking a joint, I guess it makes
[53:12.920 --> 53:13.720]  you high too.
[53:14.360 --> 53:19.560]  I don't know, but they seem really worried that people driving by would see people smoking
[53:19.560 --> 53:20.280]  weed.
[53:20.280 --> 53:26.040]  So they were talking about doing consumption at venues, open air on roof decks.
[53:26.040 --> 53:30.360]  They kept saying roof decks, which seems sort of nuts to me.
[53:30.360 --> 53:31.960]  Like, do you really want stone people?
[53:31.960 --> 53:37.240]  Three, fours up fenced in, like maybe think shit through and just let us be in the parking
[53:37.240 --> 53:37.880]  lot for a minute.
[53:37.880 --> 53:38.360]  I don't know.
[53:39.320 --> 53:45.800]  But, but, uh, hopefully some of that, the nonsense goes away with federal legislation.
[53:45.800 --> 53:48.520]  That's my big hope, especially in places like Colorado.
[53:48.520 --> 53:53.560]  Like if I was in Arkansas, I would just be tits up happy that this was happening at all
[53:54.200 --> 53:57.560]  because otherwise it probably wasn't going to happen in your neck of the woods for a
[53:57.560 --> 53:58.360]  long time.
[53:59.240 --> 54:03.720]  Um, but if everybody else gets to, why not us too, is going to be the same.
[54:04.600 --> 54:06.840]  And even the very last state to legalize.
[54:07.160 --> 54:09.160]  You get it right down the street.
[54:09.160 --> 54:10.520]  Why can't we get it here?
[54:10.520 --> 54:11.320]  I agree with that.
[54:11.960 --> 54:15.960]  Had I prepared for this show more, I would have a list of all the places that are talking
[54:15.960 --> 54:20.280]  about legalization in one form or another, but it's a long list right now.
[54:20.920 --> 54:25.560]  Pretty much everybody that's not in on it yet is talking about it in a major way.
[54:26.760 --> 54:31.800]  The last two elections were shakeups and they shook up towards legalization.
[54:32.840 --> 54:33.320]  Excellent.
[54:34.040 --> 54:34.600]  Keep shaking.
[54:36.840 --> 54:37.640]  I'm excited, dude.
[54:37.640 --> 54:39.640]  I hope we get federal legalization.
[54:39.640 --> 54:41.880]  That would help a lot of things for a lot of people.
[54:41.880 --> 54:45.800]  And it'd make things a lot more fun than when the, the vid is going to be really funny.
[54:45.800 --> 54:51.240]  If Biden has to sign that law, like it'll be really funny if president Biden has to
[54:51.240 --> 54:53.400]  sign that law for a lot of reasons.
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.120]  I don't care.
[54:54.120 --> 54:54.840]  I hope he does.
[54:55.560 --> 54:57.240]  I hope he has to sign it real soon.
[54:58.280 --> 54:58.520]  Yeah.
[54:58.520 --> 54:59.560]  The sooner the better.
[54:59.560 --> 55:01.160]  All right, Mike, let's start wrapping this up.
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.560]  I do need to get some liquid on the throat here and start wrapping up the podcast.
[55:05.560 --> 55:06.360]  Do it buddy.
[55:06.440 --> 55:10.200]  Why don't you tell people how they can find you on social media and remind them about
[55:10.200 --> 55:11.080]  your Patreon?
[55:12.520 --> 55:16.520]  You can find me at, on Twitter at Nemopunk15.
[55:16.520 --> 55:20.520]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[55:21.720 --> 55:27.320]  You can find me on Patreon if you'd like to support me in the show at patreon.com forward
[55:27.320 --> 55:28.600]  slash white Mike.
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.720]  Thank you for having me back on, but hopefully we get to do this much more often.
[55:35.720 --> 55:36.440]  Yeah, dude, this is great.
[55:36.440 --> 55:37.400]  Your background looks good.
[55:37.400 --> 55:38.840]  Your mic sounded beautiful.
[55:38.840 --> 55:40.840]  You had a great, a lot of stuff to say tonight.
[55:40.840 --> 55:41.720]  I didn't have to say much.
[55:41.720 --> 55:42.920]  I just sat back and let you go.
[55:42.920 --> 55:44.040]  Some of my favorite shows.
[55:44.680 --> 55:45.160]  Just chill out.
[55:45.160 --> 55:48.840]  Major upgrades happened to my recording space while I was away.
[55:49.720 --> 55:52.840]  Electrical improvements, gear was purchased.
[55:54.040 --> 55:54.280]  Yeah.
[55:54.280 --> 55:56.440]  And I'm real comfortable right now.
[55:56.440 --> 55:58.440]  So let's do this more often.
[55:58.440 --> 55:58.760]  Nice.
[55:58.760 --> 55:59.320]  Hell yeah, dude.
[55:59.320 --> 55:59.720]  I'm down.
[56:00.280 --> 56:02.600]  Every, every, we'll do this every Wednesday.
[56:02.600 --> 56:03.400]  No, I'm just kidding.
[56:03.400 --> 56:04.600]  I wish we could do this once a week.
[56:05.720 --> 56:06.280]  All right.
[56:06.280 --> 56:07.160]  I'm on your schedule.
[56:07.160 --> 56:07.800]  You say when.
[56:08.520 --> 56:14.120]  I would be so happy if my life was in a place where I could admit to like a regular weeknight
[56:14.120 --> 56:15.080]  event, anything.
[56:15.640 --> 56:17.480]  It'd be fucking fantastic.
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.840]  You promise you that at least one night a week, you're going to get thrown up on.
[56:20.840 --> 56:22.600]  I can almost guarantee you that in your life.
[56:22.600 --> 56:23.560]  That's my life.
[56:23.560 --> 56:25.400]  I can guarantee you that type of regularity.
[56:25.400 --> 56:29.160]  It seemed like it was going to be that type of night tonight because I had committed to
[56:29.160 --> 56:32.520]  try to do this show, but I ducked the punch, I think.
[56:32.520 --> 56:33.000]  Nice.
