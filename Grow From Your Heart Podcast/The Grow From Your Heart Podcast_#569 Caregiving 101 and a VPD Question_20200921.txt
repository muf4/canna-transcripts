[00:00.570 --> 00:03.570]  Rasta Jeff, you bad motherfucker.
[00:42.980 --> 01:00.380]  Welcome boys and girls.
[01:00.380 --> 01:04.380]  It is time for episode 569 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[01:04.380 --> 01:05.380]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:05.380 --> 01:08.740]  Of course, that intro track is brought to you by my friend, Jostifari.
[01:08.740 --> 01:13.500]  Big thanks to Jostifari for the backup podcast intro track.
[01:13.500 --> 01:16.940]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:16.940 --> 01:20.940]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Bananas Foster full spectrum extract.
[01:20.940 --> 01:22.880]  You know, I love the Bananas Foster.
[01:22.880 --> 01:26.780]  This is a blend of banana OG and Paris Larry on the package.
[01:26.780 --> 01:30.060]  The flavor is described as banana, sugar, and oatmeal.
[01:30.060 --> 01:33.740]  I think I agree with that.
[01:33.740 --> 01:37.140]  One thing I forget about quite often is that I love banana turps.
[01:37.140 --> 01:39.620]  I get an extra nice buzz from banana turps.
[01:39.620 --> 01:41.960]  I'm going to show this to the camera.
[01:41.960 --> 01:43.460]  Really beautiful concentrate.
[01:43.460 --> 01:44.460]  This is a fresh gram.
[01:44.460 --> 01:45.700]  I have not taken a dab out of this.
[01:45.700 --> 01:47.700]  I said I've been dabbing this all day.
[01:47.700 --> 01:50.340]  This is the second jar I've had to open.
[01:50.340 --> 01:53.060]  So just if you're going to call me out and say that's a fresh gram, bro.
[01:53.060 --> 01:54.540]  Yes, I did finish one.
[01:54.540 --> 01:59.600]  I do buy more than one when I go shopping, especially when it's Bananas Foster.
[01:59.600 --> 02:06.580]  On the back of the package, it says it contains 84.43% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:07.020 --> 02:11.100]  So a big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the tasty and potent Bananas
[02:11.100 --> 02:13.620]  Foster full spectrum extract.
[02:13.620 --> 02:17.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, in this episode, we're going to read
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.540]  a few Patreon messages.
[02:19.540 --> 02:23.340]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[02:23.340 --> 02:28.180]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support the show at the $7.10 a month level
[02:28.180 --> 02:30.040]  or higher on Patreon.
[02:30.040 --> 02:33.200]  So with no further ado, let's start some shout outs.
[02:33.200 --> 02:35.620]  Let's give a big thank you shout out to my friend Kurt Z.
[02:35.660 --> 02:38.060]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to our friend Aaron.
[02:38.060 --> 02:40.180]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Papa Z.
[02:40.180 --> 02:44.340]  I want to send a big special thank you shout out to my friend EZ057.
[02:44.340 --> 02:48.180]  I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Zoso J.
[02:48.180 --> 02:50.940]  I've always got a big thank you for our buddy Tonto's Garden.
[02:50.940 --> 02:53.540]  I want to send a giant thank you shout out to Jacob W.
[02:53.540 --> 02:56.100]  I want to send a big thank you to Godfather Kush.
[02:56.100 --> 03:00.460]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you
[03:00.460 --> 03:04.420]  shout out and a high five to my buddy Willie's armpit.
[03:04.420 --> 03:06.700]  Big thank you for all of the continued support.
[03:06.700 --> 03:09.720]  If you're not already supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how
[03:09.720 --> 03:16.420]  to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:16.420 --> 03:21.340]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[03:21.340 --> 03:26.060]  All right, I feel like we have covered all of the business for the start of the show.
[03:26.060 --> 03:27.380]  Let's not waste a lot of time.
[03:27.380 --> 03:31.260]  Let's jump right into the Patreon messages for this episode.
[03:31.260 --> 03:35.500]  The first Patreon message of this episode goes just like this.
[03:35.500 --> 03:40.860]  It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I found you from Jordan River's Growcast episode a couple of months
[03:40.860 --> 03:45.860]  ago and I've been listening and watching religiously ever since.
[03:45.860 --> 03:47.820]  Big shout out to our buddy Jordan River and the Growcast.
[03:47.820 --> 03:49.500]  I had a great time on that show.
[03:49.500 --> 03:52.940]  I had a couple of things in my way preventing me from getting Jordan on the show.
[03:52.940 --> 03:58.820]  Jordan, if you're listening, it is time that we schedule you to be on the show.
[03:58.820 --> 04:02.780]  Next goes on to say, my wife and I recently bought some orange chasm seeds and we cannot
[04:02.780 --> 04:05.360]  wait to get them into the cocoa.
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.180]  Several other iris strains that we want to try as well.
[04:08.180 --> 04:09.780]  We'll get to them in time.
[04:09.780 --> 04:14.020]  Yes, and every time you catch up on growing the iris genetic strains you want to grow,
[04:14.020 --> 04:16.740]  I'm going to put out more fire that gets your attention.
[04:16.740 --> 04:17.780]  So you're never going to catch up.
[04:17.780 --> 04:21.620]  It's going to be a fun game for both of us, but I love your enthusiasm.
[04:21.620 --> 04:24.660]  Also I love that your wife is included in the grow.
[04:24.660 --> 04:26.300]  Too many guys exclude the wife.
[04:26.300 --> 04:27.540]  They don't even mention the wife.
[04:27.540 --> 04:28.540]  I'm proud of you.
[04:29.260 --> 04:30.260]  Thank you for including the wife in the grow.
[04:30.260 --> 04:33.020]  We need more women growers, more women supporting us.
[04:33.020 --> 04:35.620]  Behind every good grower is a good lady.
[04:35.620 --> 04:36.620]  Let's keep moving.
[04:36.620 --> 04:40.540]  It says, I have a million questions to ask, but as I'm unable to do the Patreon thing
[04:40.540 --> 04:43.780]  for now, I will keep it brief.
[04:43.780 --> 04:47.180]  Don't think that you have to be a Patreon contributor to get your email read on the
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.180]  show.
[04:48.180 --> 04:51.300]  If you send me a great question and it's going to fit the format of the show and the timeframe
[04:51.300 --> 04:55.860]  in which I think I've got, I will pull questions from the regular email and get them on the
[04:55.860 --> 04:57.380]  show like you're seeing here.
[04:57.820 --> 05:02.300]  This one says, can you tell me how you got started in the caregiver part of your work?
[05:02.300 --> 05:04.260]  How did you find patients?
[05:04.260 --> 05:08.820]  Must your herb be tested prior to being a patient taking it from you?
[05:08.820 --> 05:12.940]  I'm looking into the caregiver licenses here in Oklahoma, and it sounds very similar to
[05:12.940 --> 05:15.140]  what you described for Colorado.
[05:15.140 --> 05:18.540]  I'm a new grower having just harvested my second solo run.
[05:18.540 --> 05:20.980]  Congratulations, but I hope the second solo run went well.
[05:20.980 --> 05:23.380]  It said, I help a couple of buddies.
[05:23.380 --> 05:24.380]  Where am I?
[05:24.380 --> 05:26.380]  I help a couple of buddies with their commercial operations.
[05:26.380 --> 05:28.380]  That is going to be invaluable experience.
[05:28.380 --> 05:30.940]  Do everything and anything they ask you to.
[05:30.940 --> 05:32.160]  You'll learn so much.
[05:32.160 --> 05:33.160]  Keep doing that.
[05:33.160 --> 05:37.820]  It says, it seems I don't suck at it, but the folks who've been around when I share,
[05:37.820 --> 05:39.420]  they seem to enjoy it.
[05:39.420 --> 05:41.580]  All right, so you're getting a lot of experience.
[05:41.580 --> 05:43.500]  You've got your second grow under your belt.
[05:43.500 --> 05:48.100]  It says, I'd love to hear your thoughts on me looking to expand my grow capacity legally.
[05:48.100 --> 05:50.980]  We get six mature plants per license holder.
[05:50.980 --> 05:55.100]  So let's touch on the main part of this question here.
[05:55.100 --> 05:59.900]  In Colorado, when medical cannabis started, we had what was called the caregiver model.
[05:59.900 --> 06:02.140]  Many people want to consume cannabis.
[06:02.140 --> 06:06.100]  Many people want to treat their ailments with cannabis, but they do not have a way to provide
[06:06.100 --> 06:08.260]  themselves with the necessary cannabis.
[06:08.260 --> 06:09.260]  They can't grow.
[06:09.260 --> 06:10.420]  They don't have a grow space.
[06:10.420 --> 06:11.680]  Maybe they're not physically able.
[06:11.680 --> 06:13.140]  Maybe they just don't care to grow.
[06:13.140 --> 06:14.300]  They want to be a consumer.
[06:14.300 --> 06:15.860]  That is just fine.
[06:15.860 --> 06:18.860]  They had to find somewhere to get their cannabis.
[06:18.860 --> 06:21.320]  Dispensaries are an option, always were an option.
[06:21.320 --> 06:24.240]  Some people don't like going to a store.
[06:24.280 --> 06:26.240]  They don't want to be seen walking into the store.
[06:26.240 --> 06:29.140]  Some people simply cannot make it to the store.
[06:29.140 --> 06:33.880]  Another way for people to obtain medical cannabis in the Colorado market at the beginning of
[06:33.880 --> 06:36.000]  this was through the caregiver model.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.720]  They would find somebody who is able, willing, and ready to grow a crop of cannabis and provide
[06:41.720 --> 06:45.120]  it to that patient at little or no cost.
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.520]  There was no rule on the cost.
[06:46.520 --> 06:51.600]  There was kind of a rule written that we wouldn't profit from it, but we were able to charge
[06:51.600 --> 06:56.880]  you for our electricity, the nutrients, our time, our energy, drying, trimming, curing,
[06:56.880 --> 06:57.880]  space.
[06:57.880 --> 06:59.080]  We could put a price tag on it.
[06:59.080 --> 07:00.960]  A lot of caregivers did different things.
[07:00.960 --> 07:04.860]  My price was kind of based on what you were able to afford.
[07:04.860 --> 07:07.960]  If you're going to smoke an ounce a month, and I know that you're going to smoke an ounce
[07:07.960 --> 07:12.920]  a month and your budget was 140 bucks, you're going to get an ounce a month for 140 bucks.
[07:12.920 --> 07:16.960]  If you were some young kid who was smoking recreationally to be cool, and you smoked
[07:16.960 --> 07:20.240]  an ounce a month, but you had 300, I was charging you 300.
[07:20.280 --> 07:23.120]  I based my scale based on your ability.
[07:23.120 --> 07:26.480]  Some of those younger kids that were hustlers and doing their thing were paying for some
[07:26.480 --> 07:30.800]  of the other folks to smoke, absolutely, but that was how the medical cannabis was working.
[07:30.800 --> 07:33.880]  So, as a caregiver, let me get myself back on track.
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.680]  I feel like I lost my train of thought here.
[07:35.680 --> 07:39.760]  As a caregiver, somebody would find somebody like me to grow that cannabis for them.
[07:39.760 --> 07:41.720]  They'd say, hey Jeff, I need cannabis.
[07:41.720 --> 07:42.960]  I need about this much a month.
[07:42.960 --> 07:44.640]  I like the strains that you grow.
[07:44.640 --> 07:46.640]  We'll use Mike as an example.
[07:46.640 --> 07:48.400]  I was Mike's caregiver.
[07:48.400 --> 07:49.400]  Mike was my patient.
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.560]  Mike went to the medical marijuana doctor, and Mike, thanks for giving me permission
[07:52.560 --> 07:55.360]  to talk about this because he didn't, and I'm just saying this hoping he's cool with
[07:55.360 --> 07:56.360]  it.
[07:56.360 --> 07:58.200]  Mike went to the medical marijuana doctor.
[07:58.200 --> 08:00.720]  The medical marijuana doctor approved his card.
[08:00.720 --> 08:06.560]  On the part of the medical marijuana recommendation is a part that says caregiver or provider.
[08:06.560 --> 08:08.680]  In that spot, he wrote my name.
[08:08.680 --> 08:13.200]  When that paper made it to the state, that gave the state the notification that I am
[08:13.200 --> 08:16.280]  allowed to grow Mike's medical cannabis plants.
[08:16.280 --> 08:20.440]  Each patient was allocated a certain amount of plants.
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.320]  There was a state recommendation and the doctor would finagle paperwork and give you extra
[08:24.320 --> 08:25.320]  plants.
[08:25.320 --> 08:28.220]  Mike would designate me his caregiver.
[08:28.220 --> 08:32.320]  Now that I am Mike's caregiver, I know that every couple of weeks or every week, Mike
[08:32.320 --> 08:35.320]  is going to need a half ounce or an ounce of Grateful Dog.
[08:35.320 --> 08:37.440]  That was Mike's favorite fucking strain on the planet.
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.040]  I could not grow enough Grateful Dog to keep Mike happy, but as his caregiver, that was
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.400]  my obligation.
[08:43.400 --> 08:44.520]  He trusted me.
[08:44.520 --> 08:45.600]  He relied on me.
[08:45.640 --> 08:48.320]  I would accept his caregiver ship card.
[08:48.320 --> 08:49.520]  He would put my name on the paper.
[08:49.520 --> 08:50.680]  I'd put my name on the paper.
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.240]  We'd mail it to the state.
[08:52.240 --> 08:56.880]  If the police, God forbid, whatever you believe in, if the law enforcement were to come to
[08:56.880 --> 08:59.600]  the house, they would say, hey, you've got too many plants.
[08:59.600 --> 09:01.600]  I would say, no, I'm a medical marijuana patient.
[09:01.600 --> 09:03.680]  I've got my paperwork for my plants.
[09:03.680 --> 09:05.880]  Also, I've got Mike's plants here.
[09:05.880 --> 09:08.640]  These are the papers that say I can have Mike's plants.
[09:08.640 --> 09:13.440]  As his caregiver, I was responsible for providing him with quality cannabis.
[09:13.520 --> 09:18.600]  Also, as a caregiver, I felt it was my responsibility to counsel him on his cannabis.
[09:18.600 --> 09:21.240]  Mike didn't need counseling, but there were other people that did.
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.240]  They needed advice, education, and guidance on how to smoke, what to smoke, when to smoke.
[09:26.240 --> 09:30.120]  There were a lot of things that I felt were my responsibility as their caregiver.
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.520]  That was just a medical cannabis caregiver, not like a health provider.
[09:33.520 --> 09:34.800]  I wasn't taking them shopping.
[09:34.800 --> 09:36.760]  I wasn't doing their dishes and shit.
[09:36.760 --> 09:38.480]  I was providing medical cannabis.
[09:38.480 --> 09:41.960]  That's what my job as a medical cannabis caregiver was.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.360]  I would find people who were in need of my service.
[09:45.360 --> 09:49.880]  I developed a reputation very quickly around here as being a grower who could provide a
[09:49.880 --> 09:50.880]  quality product.
[09:50.880 --> 09:55.160]  I had a lot of people requesting me as their caregiver.
[09:55.160 --> 09:59.800]  I also had the advantage and the blessing of being involved in the first dispensary
[09:59.800 --> 10:01.320]  in my area.
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.040]  When that dispensary, we got shut down because of zoning violations.
[10:05.040 --> 10:07.800]  We were not in the right area, so they shut down our building.
[10:07.800 --> 10:08.800]  It was brand new.
[10:08.800 --> 10:10.120]  Dispensaries weren't around yet.
[10:10.120 --> 10:11.160]  They were making the rules.
[10:11.200 --> 10:13.280]  We were breaking rules that weren't made yet.
[10:13.280 --> 10:14.320]  We were shut down.
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.560]  I saw the end coming.
[10:16.560 --> 10:18.880]  I could see things, wheels turning.
[10:18.880 --> 10:21.080]  I knew that the end of our dispensary was coming.
[10:21.080 --> 10:24.200]  I began giving people my phone number and my business card.
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.440]  I said, when this dispensary is gone, I'll be looking for people to be a caregiver for.
[10:28.440 --> 10:29.520]  That opportunity arose.
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.160]  I got to select people.
[10:31.160 --> 10:35.520]  Then the state of Colorado decided you can only be a caregiver for so many people.
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.640]  We were pushing the system, bending the rules.
[10:39.640 --> 10:41.120]  You're allowed to have six plants, right?
[10:41.120 --> 10:44.880]  If I've got 50 people that I'm their caregiver for, now I can have fucking 3,000 plants,
[10:44.880 --> 10:45.880]  right?
[10:45.880 --> 10:46.880]  Is that the math right there?
[10:46.880 --> 10:47.880]  Six plants, 50 people?
[10:47.880 --> 10:48.880]  Is that 300, 3,000?
[10:48.880 --> 10:53.080]  Whatever, 300 people, 300 plants I could put now in my grow space.
[10:53.080 --> 10:56.680]  Colorado didn't like that, so they limited us to how many people we could be a caregiver
[10:56.680 --> 10:57.680]  for.
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.600]  After that, they limited us to how many plants we can have per household total.
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.680]  No love, no stretches, no breaks on that.
[11:03.680 --> 11:05.600]  The doctor can write you an extra card.
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.080]  In most communities, in most, what is it, counties in Colorado, we were allowed six,
[11:12.040 --> 11:14.840]  medical marijuana plants and six recreational plants.
[11:14.840 --> 11:15.840]  That's it.
[11:15.840 --> 11:16.840]  You get your 12.
[11:16.840 --> 11:19.800]  Any more than that, you're going to be asking for trouble.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.760]  That's basically how I got into caregivership.
[11:21.760 --> 11:25.000]  I had a reputation for growing, and people knew that.
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.560]  I may have been providing people with black market cannabis allegedly at that time, which
[11:29.560 --> 11:31.400]  I don't think they can do anything about now.
[11:31.400 --> 11:33.080]  That's all alleged shit.
[11:33.080 --> 11:34.480]  Those people knew my product.
[11:34.480 --> 11:37.160]  When it came time, they're like, I want you to grow for me.
[11:37.160 --> 11:39.880]  Because if I was your caregiver, you got first pick on my crop.
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.800]  I harvested Cherry Widow, White Rhino, The Flow, the fucking Sour OG.
[11:44.800 --> 11:48.040]  When those came down, if I was your caregiver, you got first pick.
[11:48.040 --> 11:52.720]  Then the other people in the hood got the leftovers of that.
[11:52.720 --> 11:53.720]  Let me get back into this.
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.000]  How did I find patients?
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.360]  I had a reputation.
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.000]  I'd been around before medical cannabis was around, so I already had a reputation, and
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.680]  I was involved in a dispensary.
[12:02.680 --> 12:04.440]  That's how I found patients.
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.760]  How did I get started?
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.800]  I saved a bunch of money.
[12:06.800 --> 12:09.680]  I bought some grow lights, and I hung up grow lights, and I got some plants, and I
[12:09.680 --> 12:11.400]  fucking grew them.
[12:11.400 --> 12:13.840]  I practiced, just like you're doing, just like you were doing.
[12:13.840 --> 12:15.280]  I got involved in a commercial grow.
[12:15.280 --> 12:16.280]  I got better at it.
[12:16.280 --> 12:18.120]  I developed a reputation there.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.760]  I started doing city council meetings.
[12:19.760 --> 12:22.600]  I started doing grow lessons at grow stores downtown.
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.920]  I just got involved, and people found out who I was.
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.160]  Every time I would go to the medical marijuana doctor, I've got this big mouth.
[12:29.160 --> 12:30.160]  I can't stop talking.
[12:30.160 --> 12:32.440]  I would end up teaching people about medical cannabis there.
[12:32.440 --> 12:35.080]  I'd find new friends, new patients there.
[12:35.080 --> 12:36.440]  Start in a booming market.
[12:36.440 --> 12:39.040]  Just create a reputation for yourself.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.080]  Create a vibe for yourself.
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.080]  Be approachable.
[12:41.080 --> 12:42.360]  Create a business card.
[12:42.360 --> 12:43.360]  Create a plan.
[12:43.360 --> 12:44.360]  Have an idea.
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.360]  What's your name?
[12:45.360 --> 12:50.160]  I know what your name is on here, but make a business plan around your business name,
[12:50.160 --> 12:53.960]  J&J's Caregiving Services, and build a reputation for it.
[12:53.960 --> 12:54.960]  Go to dispensaries.
[12:54.960 --> 12:58.640]  If the dispensaries in your area are still allowed to take in product over the counter,
[12:58.640 --> 13:00.160]  I'm not sure the rules there.
[13:00.160 --> 13:03.080]  Back in the day, I could grow herb at home or wherever and take it to the dispensary
[13:03.080 --> 13:04.220]  and sell it to them.
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.940]  If you can still do that, grow a product, take it to the dispensary, tell them, this
[13:07.940 --> 13:08.940]  is what I grow.
[13:08.940 --> 13:10.220]  Give them your business card.
[13:10.220 --> 13:12.980]  They'll develop a relationship with you and want to get that product.
[13:12.980 --> 13:14.940]  Then eventually people will find out who's growing it.
[13:14.940 --> 13:17.260]  They'll want to come directly to you.
[13:17.260 --> 13:22.900]  Also, this sounds weird, but Craigslist was a huge way that people got caregiver popular
[13:22.900 --> 13:24.140]  in Colorado.
[13:24.140 --> 13:26.900]  The caregiver clones was a real funny joke here.
[13:26.900 --> 13:28.780]  The Craigslist clones was a big joke.
[13:28.780 --> 13:32.380]  You'd find caregivers looking and selling clones on Craigslist.
[13:32.380 --> 13:35.780]  I don't know how dangerous that is now, but honestly, that's how a lot of the movement
[13:35.780 --> 13:36.780]  got started here.
[13:36.780 --> 13:38.580]  You'd post your clones on Craigslist.
[13:38.580 --> 13:42.740]  You'd post caregiver services, deliveries, all of that shit.
[13:42.740 --> 13:43.900]  Find that gray line.
[13:43.900 --> 13:47.580]  Find that line in that gray area and ride the shit out of that and develop yourself
[13:47.580 --> 13:48.660]  a caregiver service.
[13:48.660 --> 13:50.660]  Be creative, be original.
[13:50.660 --> 13:53.140]  Most importantly, have a reliable product.
[13:53.140 --> 13:54.620]  Don't be a dickhead.
[13:54.620 --> 13:57.100]  Be in it for the long run.
[13:57.100 --> 13:59.560]  Here's something that applies to everybody in the cannabis industry.
[13:59.560 --> 14:00.560]  This is a marathon.
[14:00.560 --> 14:02.460]  Quit trying to make it a fucking race.
[14:02.460 --> 14:03.760]  If you win the race, big deal.
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.120]  I'm running a marathon.
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.120]  You won the race.
[14:06.120 --> 14:07.240]  You got the fastest lap.
[14:07.240 --> 14:08.240]  I'm going for longevity.
[14:08.240 --> 14:10.040]  I'm going to be in the fucking marathon, you guys.
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.800]  I'm going to be sweating for years.
[14:11.800 --> 14:12.960]  You may have sprinted.
[14:12.960 --> 14:15.640]  You may have fucking threw your arms up first and won today.
[14:15.640 --> 14:16.920]  I'm racing tomorrow.
[14:16.920 --> 14:18.000]  I'm racing the next day.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.200]  I'll be back for the races next week.
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.080]  Quit treating this industry like a fucking sprint and be in this for the marathon, or
[14:25.080 --> 14:27.480]  we are going to make our industry a sprint.
[14:27.480 --> 14:28.480]  It's going to be fucked.
[14:28.480 --> 14:31.680]  It's going to fall apart and big corporations will take over.
[14:31.680 --> 14:32.680]  That's what I see.
[14:32.680 --> 14:33.680]  Let's quit sprinting.
[14:33.680 --> 14:35.520]  Let's make it a marathon.
[14:35.520 --> 14:36.760]  Don't be a horse race.
[14:36.760 --> 14:38.160]  Be a marathon.
[14:38.160 --> 14:40.600]  Our friend is looking into caregiver licenses here.
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.240]  Make sure you get all of the licenses in order.
[14:43.240 --> 14:44.520]  Have a lawyer on retainer.
[14:44.520 --> 14:46.060]  That is something people are going to overlook.
[14:46.060 --> 14:50.280]  If you're getting into the legal cannabis game, you're going to walk, you're going to
[14:50.280 --> 14:53.520]  straddle a fine line here between what's legal and what's not.
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.720]  Have a lawyer on retainer.
[14:54.720 --> 14:55.960]  Throw them some money.
[14:55.960 --> 14:59.280]  Have a bag of money at your lawyer's office to where when you fuck up, you can reach into
[14:59.280 --> 15:01.280]  it and go, I need this much of your money.
[15:01.280 --> 15:03.600]  I'm going to take this, but we'll get you out of trouble.
[15:03.600 --> 15:04.840]  It's not a big deal.
[15:04.840 --> 15:08.320]  Be clear, open, and honest with your lawyer about what you're doing.
[15:08.320 --> 15:09.440]  You're signing papers with him.
[15:09.440 --> 15:10.440]  He's not going to snitch on you.
[15:10.440 --> 15:12.080]  You're paying him money.
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.000]  He almost needs you to almost have a little bit of problems to keep money in his bank,
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.280]  but he doesn't want to snitch on you to get you fucked.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.480]  He needs your business.
[15:20.480 --> 15:21.800]  He's going to keep you safe.
[15:21.800 --> 15:22.800]  Give him some money.
[15:22.800 --> 15:24.040]  The lawyer is amazing.
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.840]  Do everything legally.
[15:26.840 --> 15:31.320]  How to find patients, create that relationship, create that reputation, be cool with people,
[15:31.320 --> 15:33.960]  be approachable, have knowledge.
[15:33.960 --> 15:34.960]  Have knowledge.
[15:34.960 --> 15:35.960]  Don't be fake.
[15:35.960 --> 15:36.960]  Know what you're talking about.
[15:36.960 --> 15:39.720]  Then the next question is, must your herb be lab tested?
[15:39.720 --> 15:44.600]  Unfortunately, here in Colorado, patients cannot get their quality product lab tested.
[15:44.600 --> 15:48.440]  You must be marijuana enforcement division regulated, which means you've got to be a
[15:48.440 --> 15:51.680]  dispensary grow to get your product lab tested.
[15:51.680 --> 15:52.920]  There are a couple of reasons for that.
[15:52.920 --> 15:55.640]  The main reason is there are not enough labs.
[15:55.640 --> 15:59.960]  The labs are overwhelmed and backed up with commercial grow products or personal grows.
[15:59.960 --> 16:01.440]  They just said, we don't even have time for you.
[16:01.440 --> 16:02.440]  Go away.
[16:02.440 --> 16:08.040]  Another thing, if the facility is not marijuana enforcement division regulated and more than
[16:08.040 --> 16:14.200]  enough people drop off samples today, and that collection facility is in possession
[16:14.200 --> 16:19.320]  of more grams than what their license allows, they are now in possession of an illegal amount
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.000]  of cannabis.
[16:21.080 --> 16:25.920]  If I wanted to get 114 grams tested today, and so did you, and they're a personal limit
[16:25.920 --> 16:29.400]  because they're not a marijuana enforcement division regulated facility, they're allowed
[16:29.400 --> 16:35.520]  to have up to two ounces of product, depending on their ... They can have two ounces, I think.
[16:35.520 --> 16:38.560]  As soon as they pass two ounces of product, they are now illegal.
[16:38.560 --> 16:40.560]  They can't have two ounces of weed in the building.
[16:40.560 --> 16:45.280]  They're breaking all kinds of rules, so they can't receive your samples to test them.
[16:45.280 --> 16:48.200]  There is a loophole.
[16:48.200 --> 16:50.120]  Let's talk about this in hypothetical.
[16:50.240 --> 16:52.480]  There is a hypothetical situation that happens.
[16:52.480 --> 16:57.720]  We do have a large hemp industry here in Colorado, and your hemp must be tested to verify that
[16:57.720 --> 16:58.720]  it is not hot.
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.240]  Hot meaning it is over 0.03% THC.
[17:01.240 --> 17:04.760]  If you got too much THC in it, that is cannabis.
[17:04.760 --> 17:05.760]  It's not hemp.
[17:05.760 --> 17:09.360]  It must be labeled cannabis or destroyed because that is not a sellable hemp.
[17:09.360 --> 17:11.020]  That is now weed marijuana.
[17:11.020 --> 17:12.720]  It's totally differently regulated.
[17:12.720 --> 17:14.520]  Your crop is no good as hemp.
[17:14.520 --> 17:16.960]  We have to have all of our hemp tested.
[17:16.960 --> 17:21.840]  There's nothing to stop a grower from taking his crop to a hemp testing facility and having
[17:21.840 --> 17:23.160]  them test it.
[17:23.160 --> 17:27.160]  The bad thing that happens is they give you back a paper that says, you have failed the
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.640]  hemp test.
[17:28.640 --> 17:31.800]  Your hemp does not have less than 3% THC.
[17:31.800 --> 17:34.260]  It's got like 24% THC.
[17:34.260 --> 17:35.260]  This hemp is no good.
[17:35.260 --> 17:36.260]  This is cannabis.
[17:36.260 --> 17:39.280]  Then you have to look at the guy with the straight face and go, I fucked up.
[17:39.280 --> 17:40.840]  I wonder what I did wrong with my hemp.
[17:40.840 --> 17:41.840]  Wink, wink.
[17:41.840 --> 17:45.660]  Then you get to go home and you go, I got a 23% test on my weed.
[17:45.660 --> 17:46.760]  That is the way around it.
[17:47.560 --> 17:48.680]  Don't tell anybody that I told you.
[17:48.680 --> 17:51.440]  Definitely don't tell the people at the lab that that is your intention.
[17:51.440 --> 17:53.320]  Go in there acting like you're testing your hemp.
[17:53.320 --> 17:58.200]  Then when you find out that your hemp is amazingly high in THC, be shocked, act appalled, and
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.400]  then go home and call your friends and celebrate and post the lab results to social media.
[18:02.400 --> 18:05.760]  That is the way to get your stuff tested in a Colorado market.
[18:05.760 --> 18:10.120]  I don't know the availability of testing in the Oklahoma market.
[18:10.120 --> 18:15.080]  There are products they are selling that allegedly will test your product at home, on site with
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.160]  your phone and this little device.
[18:17.160 --> 18:18.160]  I haven't used it.
[18:18.160 --> 18:20.680]  I know a couple of people that claim it's awesome.
[18:20.680 --> 18:26.080]  If you are involved with that company that makes a homemade cannabis lab testing kit,
[18:26.080 --> 18:27.080]  I'd like to try it out.
[18:27.080 --> 18:28.400]  I'll talk about it on the show.
[18:28.400 --> 18:31.740]  If it's an awesome product, I'll give you an amazing fucking review.
[18:31.740 --> 18:35.040]  If your product isn't as impressive as you claim, you might not want to send me one.
[18:35.040 --> 18:38.960]  But if you are from the purple company that makes the lab testing equipment, here is my
[18:38.960 --> 18:39.960]  official request.
[18:39.960 --> 18:41.000]  I'm going to try one.
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.000]  Let me try it out on the show.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.240]  If it's awesome, you'll get a lot of free advertising.
[18:45.240 --> 18:46.240]  Give me one of those fuckers.
[18:46.240 --> 18:47.240]  I'll try it out.
[18:47.240 --> 18:48.240]  We'll talk about it on the show.
[18:48.240 --> 18:49.240]  A lot, a lot, a lot.
[18:49.240 --> 18:50.240]  I'd love to see that.
[18:50.240 --> 18:51.240]  Shout out to purple.
[18:51.240 --> 18:52.800]  If anybody can link me up with purple, go for it.
[18:52.800 --> 18:53.800]  I love you for that.
[18:53.800 --> 18:58.000]  I need to get myself back on track or this is going to be a really long podcast.
[18:58.000 --> 19:01.680]  Get into caregiving by creating that reputation, building relationships.
[19:01.680 --> 19:03.640]  There are patients that need a caregiver.
[19:03.640 --> 19:05.040]  You're a caregiver that needs patients.
[19:05.040 --> 19:06.920]  It's all about finding those people.
[19:06.920 --> 19:08.620]  It's all about putting yourself in the right spot.
[19:08.620 --> 19:11.000]  Right now, your industry is booming where you are.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.440]  Go to the events, go meet the people, go show off your product.
[19:14.440 --> 19:17.880]  If you've got the good product, people will be banging down your door to get signed up
[19:17.880 --> 19:18.880]  for you to be their caregiver.
[19:18.880 --> 19:20.160]  I want to keep going.
[19:20.160 --> 19:21.160]  I think there's more.
[19:21.160 --> 19:26.520]  I'd love to hear your thoughts on me looking to expand my growth capacity legally.
[19:26.520 --> 19:27.520]  I get the idea.
[19:27.520 --> 19:31.040]  The more caregiver cards you have, the more plants you can grow.
[19:31.040 --> 19:34.420]  Don't forget that just because you're growing more plants doesn't mean you got more herb.
[19:34.420 --> 19:36.960]  You've got people relying on you for that product.
[19:36.960 --> 19:40.520]  Maybe you can move a little bit more of it, but you do have those people gave you their
[19:40.520 --> 19:41.520]  rights.
[19:41.520 --> 19:43.160]  They've given away their grow rights to you.
[19:43.160 --> 19:44.160]  They're relying on you.
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.160]  They're trusting you.
[19:45.160 --> 19:46.160]  Respect that shit.
[19:46.160 --> 19:48.880]  Give them a quality, safe, clean product, and don't profit.
[19:48.880 --> 19:49.880]  Ridiculous.
[19:49.880 --> 19:50.880]  You've got to make some money.
[19:50.880 --> 19:52.680]  You've got to cover the lights and nutrients, all that.
[19:52.680 --> 19:53.680]  Don't get rich off these people.
[19:53.680 --> 19:57.080]  It is very important that you don't focus on making a lot of money off the people you're
[19:57.080 --> 19:58.240]  caregiving for.
[19:58.240 --> 19:59.360]  Make sure they are well.
[19:59.360 --> 20:00.560]  Make sure they are provided for.
[20:00.560 --> 20:04.600]  Make sure they've got the strains that they need for their medical ailments or their conditions,
[20:04.600 --> 20:05.840]  whatever you want to call it.
[20:05.840 --> 20:09.440]  If you need to make some profit, make that profit off of those black market folks.
[20:09.440 --> 20:13.560]  Like I said earlier, I had some older patients that were on a fixed income, not making a
[20:13.560 --> 20:14.560]  lot of money.
[20:14.560 --> 20:18.240]  I made sure they got the medicine they needed for the budget that they had.
[20:18.240 --> 20:20.080]  Sometimes if they didn't have the budget, guess what?
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.680]  They still got the medicine.
[20:21.680 --> 20:25.400]  Those younger guys that park out front, leave the music up too loud, leave their girlfriend
[20:25.400 --> 20:28.640]  in the car, run in, run out, they covered the extra cost.
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.240]  You'll learn how to balance that economy so that your pocket doesn't dwindle and nobody
[20:32.240 --> 20:36.000]  feels like they're getting slighted in your cannabis endeavors.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.440]  Where else am I in this message?
[20:37.440 --> 20:39.280]  Two more quick things.
[20:39.400 --> 20:40.960]  It says, your lapel mic is okay.
[20:40.960 --> 20:42.800]  Yeah, I felt the lapel mic was okay.
[20:42.800 --> 20:44.200]  I've listened to a couple of those episodes.
[20:44.200 --> 20:46.280]  It doesn't have the boom that this mic has.
[20:46.280 --> 20:47.800]  I'm going to stick with this mic.
[20:47.800 --> 20:48.840]  I like this one better.
[20:48.840 --> 20:50.640]  I liked that I looked more freed up.
[20:50.640 --> 20:52.880]  I was more free, but this microphone here is comfortable.
[20:52.880 --> 20:53.880]  I can put my arm on it.
[20:53.880 --> 20:55.080]  I could grab the mic.
[20:55.080 --> 20:59.320]  I caught myself reaching for the mic that wasn't there when I had the lapel mic on.
[20:59.320 --> 21:01.040]  I appreciate that compliment.
[21:01.040 --> 21:02.560]  It says, the lapel mic is okay.
[21:02.560 --> 21:07.000]  The boom mic has a much wider frequency response and sounds much better to my ears.
[21:07.040 --> 21:12.360]  I play bass with some other local musicians, so take that for what you will.
[21:12.360 --> 21:14.400]  You lost all credibility at the word, I play bass.
[21:14.400 --> 21:15.400]  No, I'm just kidding, bro.
[21:15.400 --> 21:17.760]  I'm a drummer, so it's my job to pick on the bass player.
[21:17.760 --> 21:20.000]  I'm in a band as well, was in a band as well.
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.120]  I know what it's like picking on other musicians.
[21:22.120 --> 21:24.760]  The bass player, there are so many fucking bass player jokes.
[21:24.760 --> 21:25.760]  I love it.
[21:25.760 --> 21:26.760]  Shout out to the bass players.
[21:26.760 --> 21:29.920]  The drums and the bass are the king of the dance.
[21:29.920 --> 21:33.320]  You're very accurate with your observation and assessment.
[21:33.320 --> 21:36.920]  This mic does provide a much boomier, I call it the God mic.
[21:36.960 --> 21:41.000]  When I'm on Zoom videos with other people and they're using iPhone fucking lapel mics
[21:41.000 --> 21:42.600]  and shit, I'm like, hello, it's God.
[21:42.600 --> 21:44.200]  My mic will overpower all of you.
[21:44.200 --> 21:46.600]  I can just talk right over anybody if I want.
[21:46.600 --> 21:47.600]  I do love this mic.
[21:47.600 --> 21:49.160]  That is much more powerful.
[21:49.160 --> 21:50.160]  Thank you for noticing.
[21:50.160 --> 21:51.840]  It says, take that for what you will.
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.840]  I'm taking it that I should stick with this mic and only use the lapel mic in other environments
[21:55.840 --> 21:57.800]  and situations.
[21:57.800 --> 22:00.120]  Then I like the last part of your message.
[22:00.120 --> 22:05.320]  It says, lastly, park mic right in front of a wall so he can't back away from the mic
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.960]  like he is prone to do.
[22:06.960 --> 22:10.320]  The dude has some great stuff when we can hear him.
[22:10.320 --> 22:12.160]  That's a really good fucking way to do that.
[22:12.160 --> 22:15.240]  I put the mic right in front of Mike and put a wall back there so he can't keep leaning
[22:15.240 --> 22:16.240]  back off the microphone.
[22:16.240 --> 22:18.040]  He can't miss stuff he's saying.
[22:18.040 --> 22:19.440]  That is a good idea.
[22:19.440 --> 22:23.640]  Unfortunately, Mike lives at a different spot and I can't really control where the walls
[22:23.640 --> 22:24.640]  are.
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.760]  I will make sure that Mike gets his mic adjusted.
[22:26.760 --> 22:30.080]  We get the levels on Mike a little more appropriate because the dude does have some great shit
[22:30.080 --> 22:31.080]  to say.
[22:31.080 --> 22:33.160]  I've got him writing a full episode.
[22:33.160 --> 22:34.160]  He's been focusing.
[22:34.160 --> 22:35.480]  I haven't seen him for a minute.
[22:35.480 --> 22:38.120]  He's been focusing on writing his own podcast episode.
[22:38.120 --> 22:39.520]  I'm going to highlight Mike on the show.
[22:39.520 --> 22:42.200]  I know when he's on here, I do over talk him.
[22:42.200 --> 22:43.400]  I'm trying to steer a show.
[22:43.400 --> 22:46.760]  I give him his opportunity, but sometimes I'm like, you've been going for six minutes.
[22:46.760 --> 22:48.080]  I want to go a different direction.
[22:48.080 --> 22:49.080]  Let's drive the show.
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.640]  I try not to cut him off, but I'm going to give him the opportunity to do basically his
[22:52.640 --> 22:53.640]  own show.
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.320]  I will be there driving the show, but I'm just going to stay out of the way and let
[22:56.320 --> 22:57.320]  him talk.
[22:57.320 --> 22:58.560]  You're right.
[22:58.560 --> 23:01.720]  He does have some great shit to say if and when we can hear him.
[23:01.720 --> 23:03.320]  Mike, stay on the mic, buddy.
[23:03.320 --> 23:06.560]  If we need to get Mike a new mic, I may check out one of those Yeti blue mics or one of
[23:06.560 --> 23:09.800]  those other mics pretty soon for him because I want him to be heard, but thank you for
[23:09.800 --> 23:10.800]  the guidance.
[23:10.800 --> 23:13.320]  This one says, stay safe and stay Irie.
[23:13.320 --> 23:16.240]  I'm not sure if he wants your name said it's from a couple.
[23:16.240 --> 23:21.760]  So shout out to J and J. Thank you for the great message and good luck on your caregiver
[23:21.760 --> 23:22.760]  endeavors.
[23:22.760 --> 23:24.580]  I think I hope things go well.
[23:24.580 --> 23:27.280]  If you need any more, if you have specific questions, reach out.
[23:27.280 --> 23:28.560]  If you need more guidance, let me know.
[23:28.560 --> 23:32.960]  I'm more than happy to help you jump into the caregiver game.
[23:32.960 --> 23:36.800]  Shout out to all my friends out there in Oklahoma, making a new industry fucking happen.
[23:36.800 --> 23:38.920]  All right, I'm going to read another message.
[23:38.920 --> 23:42.640]  We're already like 20 something minutes into this episode, but we ain't got nothing but
[23:42.640 --> 23:44.000]  time, right?
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.260]  Everyone's on quarantine.
[23:45.260 --> 23:46.960]  It's still pandy time.
[23:46.960 --> 23:47.960]  You need more content.
[23:47.960 --> 23:49.000]  So let's keep going.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.040]  This one goes like this.
[23:50.040 --> 23:52.760]  This one is from our friend Bafsta.
[23:52.760 --> 23:54.320]  It says, Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[23:54.320 --> 23:58.120]  I got a question for you about VPD.
[23:58.120 --> 24:03.640]  I recently purchased the pulse monitor and I want to get my grow tent in perfect condition.
[24:03.640 --> 24:10.520]  I'm running a four by eight gorilla grow tent with two HLG, five fifties and UV light.
[24:10.520 --> 24:12.800]  Does VPD matter at night?
[24:12.800 --> 24:16.680]  And if so, what is recommended during lights on?
[24:16.680 --> 24:22.200]  What do you recommend the best VPD and also any tips, any tips on achieving this number?
[24:22.200 --> 24:28.040]  I started five, 10 gallons with lemon Jeffrey and I'll post picks as I go on cannabis.
[24:28.960 --> 24:29.960]  Thank you for the help, sir.
[24:29.960 --> 24:30.960]  From Bafsta.
[24:30.960 --> 24:35.160]  And then he signed it with hashtag I re army big up to the I re army.
[24:35.160 --> 24:36.600]  Big shout out to our buddy Bafsta.
[24:36.600 --> 24:43.840]  This is a great question asking about V P D. Um, they recently grabbed a pulse monitor,
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.240]  which will tell you the VPD, the temperature, the humidity will give you a lot of great
[24:48.240 --> 24:50.920]  feedback on that grow space.
[24:50.920 --> 24:52.720]  He says he wants to get it in perfect condition.
[24:52.720 --> 24:55.240]  Uh, sounds like he's got enough light in there.
[24:55.240 --> 24:58.840]  He wants to know if the VPD is going to matter at night.
[24:58.840 --> 25:02.560]  And if so, what do I recommend?
[25:02.560 --> 25:03.680]  I really like charts.
[25:03.680 --> 25:08.560]  I really like monitors, but the plants are the boss.
[25:08.560 --> 25:12.040]  If the plants look happy, give them what makes them look happy.
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.680]  There is a VPD chart that will show you standard ideas of where to get your temperature and
[25:16.680 --> 25:18.360]  humidity.
[25:18.360 --> 25:22.000]  If you can't get the temperature at a certain range, you can adjust the humidity to go with
[25:22.000 --> 25:23.000]  that range.
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.320]  If you can't get the humidity at a certain range, or if the humidity is able to stay
[25:26.320 --> 25:30.160]  at a certain range, adjust the temperature to go to that range.
[25:30.160 --> 25:33.080]  It's all about what works for your environment and your plants.
[25:33.080 --> 25:34.640]  The plants are the boss.
[25:34.640 --> 25:35.640]  The monitors are great.
[25:35.640 --> 25:37.400]  The equipment is fucking awesome.
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.440]  All the information is fucking wonderful, but keeping an eye on the plants is the key.
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.480]  Now I know you want numbers, you want details.
[25:45.480 --> 25:50.240]  So I'm going to give you ideas of my VPD and my temperature and humidity, whatever you're
[25:50.240 --> 25:51.760]  running during the day.
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.560]  What is making the plants happy during the daytime?
[25:54.560 --> 26:00.440]  I would recommend running about 5 to 10 degrees cooler during your night cycle.
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.580]  The VPD does matter during the night cycle just as much during the day.
[26:04.580 --> 26:06.800]  Don't overlook that nighttime VPD.
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.440]  We do need that VPD during the night dialed in.
[26:09.440 --> 26:15.960]  So temperature, I would say 5 to 10 degrees cooler than your daytime temperature.
[26:15.960 --> 26:17.560]  Maybe 15 degrees.
[26:17.560 --> 26:20.120]  Definitely don't hit that 20 degree temperature swing.
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.440]  If you're running at 80 degrees during the day and the plants look happy, let's go 75,
[26:25.440 --> 26:27.080]  70 degrees at night.
[26:27.080 --> 26:28.280]  Don't go more than 10 degrees.
[26:28.280 --> 26:32.600]  5 to 10 degree temperature swing and your diurnal swing is going to be perfect.
[26:32.600 --> 26:35.840]  For humidity, I would follow the same guidelines.
[26:35.840 --> 26:40.200]  About 5 to 10% more humid at night would be acceptable.
[26:40.200 --> 26:45.320]  Let's not go more than 10 to 20% difference in our humidity in our night cycle.
[26:45.320 --> 26:52.760]  So 5 to 10%, maybe 10 to 20% maximum difference in our daytime and nighttime relative humidity
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.120]  and temperature.
[26:54.120 --> 26:58.000]  I don't know the exact VPD number that you're going to want to hit.
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.160]  It's going to be challenging to get the exact VPD.
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.300]  Either your temperature or your humidity are going to be kind of set based on your room
[27:05.300 --> 27:06.780]  and where the grow is.
[27:06.780 --> 27:08.880]  One of those is going to be hard to control.
[27:08.880 --> 27:10.080]  Match the other one with that.
[27:10.080 --> 27:13.800]  If you've got a VPD chart, it'll show you when the humidity is here, you want the temperature
[27:13.800 --> 27:14.800]  here.
[27:14.800 --> 27:16.280]  You want the humidity here.
[27:16.280 --> 27:17.740]  Find where you can make that work.
[27:17.740 --> 27:20.960]  But most importantly, watch the plants.
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.160]  If the plants are curling up, it's too hot.
[27:23.160 --> 27:26.560]  If the leaves are getting kind of brittle and skinny, it's too dry.
[27:26.560 --> 27:29.880]  If they're starting to droop and hang, it could be a lot of different things.
[27:29.880 --> 27:30.960]  Pay attention to the plants.
[27:30.960 --> 27:32.360]  The plants are always the boss.
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.360]  I love the equipment.
[27:33.360 --> 27:36.880]  I love that you want to get things dialed in and I wish that I had a better number for
[27:36.880 --> 27:37.880]  you.
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.000]  Look at a VPD chart.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.120]  See where your temperature is.
[27:40.120 --> 27:41.980]  See where your humidity is.
[27:41.980 --> 27:44.620]  See which one you can correct and get right where you want it.
[27:45.440 --> 27:46.440]  Look at the VPD chart.
[27:46.440 --> 27:49.300]  See if you're matching up with something on there, getting a value which you think will
[27:49.300 --> 27:50.700]  work for your plants.
[27:50.700 --> 27:54.380]  Then look at the plants and see how they are reacting to those values.
[27:54.380 --> 27:55.900]  I know you want numbers.
[27:55.900 --> 27:57.940]  The plants don't know what numbers are.
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.620]  So make the plants happy.
[27:59.620 --> 28:01.420]  Adjust to the plants.
[28:01.420 --> 28:05.820]  Once you've got that room dialed in, you can use the monitor to make sure that your VPD
[28:05.820 --> 28:06.900]  is where you want it.
[28:06.900 --> 28:09.240]  But let the plants tell you what they want.
[28:09.240 --> 28:12.500]  Then use the monitor to get it there and keep it there all the time.
[28:12.500 --> 28:14.500]  That is my recommendation.
[28:14.620 --> 28:15.620]  Best VPD.
[28:15.620 --> 28:18.220]  Also any tips on achieving the number.
[28:18.220 --> 28:20.500]  Watch the plants and then set the equipment accordingly.
[28:20.500 --> 28:23.340]  You may need a humidifier and a dehumidifier.
[28:23.340 --> 28:24.620]  You may need an air conditioner.
[28:24.620 --> 28:26.220]  You may need a heater.
[28:26.220 --> 28:30.660]  Use all of the equipment appropriately and you're just going to have to experiment.
[28:30.660 --> 28:34.700]  You may need to increase or reduce your intake and outtake of air.
[28:34.700 --> 28:39.500]  All of that stuff depends on where the room is, what the environment is in which the grow
[28:39.500 --> 28:40.500]  tent is in.
[28:40.500 --> 28:41.940]  Is that grow room really hot?
[28:41.940 --> 28:43.100]  Is that grow room really cold?
[28:43.100 --> 28:44.100]  Is that grow room really dry?
[28:44.100 --> 28:47.500]  You're going to have to work with what you've got and you're going to have to let the plants
[28:47.500 --> 28:49.740]  dictate what they need from there.
[28:49.740 --> 28:53.180]  I know you expected a specific VPD number.
[28:53.180 --> 28:56.100]  I'm not even going to give you a number to try to strive for because I don't know what
[28:56.100 --> 29:00.020]  you're starting with and I don't want to make you struggle to get to something that is not
[29:00.020 --> 29:01.020]  even attainable.
[29:01.020 --> 29:05.100]  Dude, if you've got any more specific questions and I can help you out any better with any
[29:05.100 --> 29:07.460]  more info, you know I would love to help you.
[29:07.460 --> 29:09.020]  You're a big part of the Irie Army.
[29:09.020 --> 29:10.300]  So thank you for the support.
[29:10.300 --> 29:11.820]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[29:11.820 --> 29:13.580]  Shout out to my buddy Bafsta.
[29:13.580 --> 29:17.340]  I feel like I kind of left you in the dark and said, watch the plants and let the plants
[29:17.340 --> 29:21.220]  tell you the VPD and then use the meters to keep that constant.
[29:21.220 --> 29:22.220]  But they're plants.
[29:22.220 --> 29:23.220]  They're the boss.
[29:23.220 --> 29:24.220]  The meters are cool.
[29:24.220 --> 29:25.220]  We're really smart.
[29:25.220 --> 29:26.620]  The plants are the fucking rulers.
[29:26.620 --> 29:27.820]  They tell us what to do.
[29:27.820 --> 29:29.540]  We become slaves to the plants.
[29:29.540 --> 29:30.620]  All right.
[29:30.620 --> 29:32.980]  I think that is all I've got time for for this episode.
[29:32.980 --> 29:37.380]  I want to thank you guys again for hanging out for episode 569 of the Grow From Your
[29:37.380 --> 29:38.580]  Heart podcast.
