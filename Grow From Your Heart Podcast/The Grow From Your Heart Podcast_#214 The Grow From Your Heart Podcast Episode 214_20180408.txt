[00:01.720 --> 00:03.640]  Hey, what's up, Podcast World?
[00:03.640 --> 00:04.720]  It's Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.720 --> 00:07.800]  It's Thursday, so that means it's time for a chunk of old episodes of the Grow From Your
[00:07.800 --> 00:09.120]  Heart Podcast.
[00:09.120 --> 00:15.760]  This week, I'm reposting episodes 45, 46, 47, and 48 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:15.760 --> 00:19.120]  Before we get to the episodes, let me make a couple of quick disclaimers.
[00:19.120 --> 00:20.600]  The email address has changed.
[00:20.600 --> 00:23.460]  The new email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[00:23.460 --> 00:28.080]  The new Twitter is at GFYH Podcast, and on Facebook, you need to search for the Grow
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.240]  From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:29.240 --> 00:34.000]  Also, any giveaways, contests, advertisements, or promotions in these episodes have expired,
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.040]  so don't get too excited.
[00:36.040 --> 00:42.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, I bring you episodes 45, 46, 47, and 48 of
[00:42.120 --> 00:43.480]  the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:43.480 --> 01:02.400]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:02.400 --> 01:08.520]  Welcome to episode number 45 of the iGrowCulture Podcast, the podcast all about cannabis news,
[01:08.520 --> 01:09.520]  education, and conversation.
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.080]  If you're a new grower, a pro grower, a longtime cannabis consumer, a brand new smoker, or
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.960]  just someone who's curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the
[01:18.960 --> 01:19.960]  podcast for you.
[01:19.960 --> 01:20.960]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:20.960 --> 01:21.960]  Thanks for joining me.
[01:21.960 --> 01:22.960]  Hanging on over to my left here is our good buddy, King Kola.
[01:22.960 --> 01:23.960]  How are you doing, buddy?
[01:23.960 --> 01:24.960]  Good, man.
[01:24.960 --> 01:25.960]  Thanks for having me.
[01:25.960 --> 01:26.960]  Man, I started to choke right as I tried to introduce you.
[01:26.960 --> 01:27.960]  I apologize.
[01:27.960 --> 01:28.960]  I stumbled there.
[01:28.960 --> 01:29.960]  I just took a big giant dab, and it took about a minute to kick in, and I happened to be
[01:29.960 --> 01:30.960]  right at the start of the show.
[01:30.960 --> 01:31.960]  Wow, let's turn on the music.
[01:31.960 --> 01:32.960]  Then I won't have to yell.
[01:32.960 --> 01:33.960]  Wow.
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  Across the table is Adam.
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.960]  How are you doing, bro?
[01:35.960 --> 01:36.960]  Good, man.
[01:36.960 --> 01:37.960]  Tired.
[01:37.960 --> 01:38.960]  Tired.
[01:38.960 --> 01:39.960]  You're all red-eyed, and you got drywall dust in your hair and shit.
[01:39.960 --> 01:40.960]  You have no idea.
[01:40.960 --> 01:41.960]  You look like a working man.
[01:41.960 --> 01:42.960]  Yeah.
[01:42.960 --> 01:43.960]  I'm dirty.
[01:43.960 --> 01:44.960]  Less video games and more working lately, right?
[01:44.960 --> 01:45.960]  Yeah.
[01:45.960 --> 01:46.960]  It's about time.
[01:46.960 --> 01:47.960]  They're even getting all rough and tumbled.
[01:47.960 --> 01:48.960]  Rough and tumbled.
[01:48.960 --> 01:49.960]  You guys, this is the holiday season.
[01:49.960 --> 01:50.960]  It's the holiday season.
[01:50.960 --> 01:51.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:52.960 --> 01:53.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:53.960 --> 01:54.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:54.960 --> 01:55.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:55.960 --> 01:56.960]  It's the time of the year.
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.740]  to label it as.
[01:59.740 --> 02:08.920]  I'm not going to judge you.
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.520]  I support all of your holiday decisions, whatever religion, race, creed you are.
[02:13.520 --> 02:15.160]  I hope you have a great winter holiday.
[02:15.160 --> 02:16.600]  I hope you get a lot of gifts.
[02:16.600 --> 02:21.800]  If you're into the gift-giving thing, I hope you give a lot of gifts.
[02:21.800 --> 02:23.500]  By, humbug.
[02:23.500 --> 02:25.640]  You're not into the holiday thing, bro?
[02:25.640 --> 02:26.640]  No.
[02:26.640 --> 02:31.560]  change that for you? What do we give you gifts? Give your kids some gifts? I've gotten gifts
[02:31.560 --> 02:35.980]  that blow my mind in the past couple years, but it's always like now I feel obligated
[02:35.980 --> 02:39.240]  because I'm an adult and that's the proper thing to do and I understand that that's not
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.520]  what it was about. But yeah, what if we just hold you down? Bender is a great example.
[02:45.520 --> 02:48.400]  Bender's a great and kind person. Oh, I see what you're saying. Bender hooked you up with
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.480]  a fat gift and now you feel fucked. I feel fucked. The people that are able to give out
[02:53.480 --> 02:56.640]  kind gifts like that to our friends that we know can't give a gift like that. We do
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.240]  it because we know that you want that shit and that you deserve it and we don't expect
[03:00.240 --> 03:02.920]  anything in return. You're going to fucking play with that. You're going to throw that
[03:02.920 --> 03:07.760]  thing he gave you. Our buddy Bender gave Adam, can I say that? He gave you a video card,
[03:07.760 --> 03:10.320]  a graphics card for your computer and you're going to love it, dude. That's what it's about.
[03:10.320 --> 03:13.840]  He's going to see you smiling and all shitted and giggled and you're playing with it and
[03:13.840 --> 03:17.880]  that's what it's about. It ain't about you giving him back a gift. Yeah, absolutely.
[03:17.880 --> 03:21.920]  And thank you. Yeah, so cheer up and fucking enjoy the holidays with us or we'll hold you
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.480]  down and tickle you. You know, I try with the kids, but it's hard. How's that going
[03:25.480 --> 03:29.040]  to make you feel when two grown men hold you down and tickle you? Have you been tickled
[03:29.040 --> 03:35.320]  as a grown man? Not since I left Florida. This just took an awkward turn. I'm going
[03:35.320 --> 03:39.240]  to try to put it back on track. Um, I want to mention something. I mentioned it's the
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.280]  holiday season. iTunes sent me an email and they say that there will be a delay in podcast
[03:44.280 --> 03:49.880]  posting between December 22nd and January 5th, which will affect this episode and possibly
[03:49.880 --> 03:54.120]  another episode. I will post them early. I'll try to get them. We're recording on a
[03:54.120 --> 03:58.280]  Thursday. The show comes out on a Monday. I'll try to put it up like Saturday night
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.360]  and hopefully that'll give iTunes time to do whatever it is they're doing. I'm not sure
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.880]  why they choose to do that around Christmas time, but people love it early. They can love
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.640]  it early. Yeah. If it makes it, it may not. I don't know what it's going to do. Also,
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.720]  I want to remind you guys, we're going to change the name of the podcast. Eventually
[04:14.720 --> 04:19.200]  I said December 1st, but I was high. I met January 1st. Uh, we're going to start calling
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.280]  it the grow from your heart podcast because I grow is actually a horticulture, agricultural,
[04:25.280 --> 04:30.280]  educational institution that does not want me associating their name with our beloved
[04:30.280 --> 04:34.200]  sacred plant. So before they send me a cease and desist letter, I'm just going to go ahead
[04:34.200 --> 04:38.880]  and switch it up. It's the responsible thing to do. That's kind. I don't want to rip off
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.080]  anybody else's name. You know, if somebody else was called I grow culture, uh, I'd be
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.480]  pissed off about that, you know, and, or if they were called I read genetics, I'd be double
[04:46.480 --> 04:53.160]  pissed. So I gotta be fair. It's very noble. It's just, uh, I want to move your mic closer
[04:53.160 --> 04:56.240]  to you, but you've got, yeah, you've got that beautiful hit man rig in front of you that
[04:56.240 --> 05:01.080]  you grabbed. Did you get that at the Emerald cup? Yeah. That is sexy. Thank you. Uh, I
[05:01.080 --> 05:03.720]  didn't write down any space for you to ramble about the Emerald cup, but do you want to
[05:03.720 --> 05:07.760]  tell us about your experience for a second? Uh, yeah, the Emerald cup, it was a, that's
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.680]  good. That way. There you go. Yeah. The Emerald cup was a great time. Uh, I'd highly recommend,
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.720]  uh, all growers to try to make it out to that one. Uh, best cup I've ever seen. Nice.
[05:17.720 --> 05:22.560]  That's a huge thing to say. Yeah. It's way different. It's not as tongue in cheek as
[05:22.560 --> 05:29.400]  the cannabis cup. There's, it's not a stereotypical. Yeah. So less of a, less of an RV show and
[05:29.400 --> 05:33.600]  more of a growers kind of a thing. And it's in Santa Rosa, California, right? Yes. Awesome.
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.280]  So you flew out there to hang out with Baca a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Me and him went out there
[05:37.280 --> 05:40.520]  to get out to Baca. He's never gotten a, a shout out on the podcast. What's up James?
[05:40.520 --> 05:44.560]  Sending you some love, bro. Hopefully I get to dab sometime soon. We keep talking about
[05:44.560 --> 05:48.520]  it. It just doesn't happen. All of us growers. Yeah. All the growers are hard to get in one
[05:48.520 --> 05:53.680]  room together. Yeah, I know. And it's like we went to Cali and it's like for four days,
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.480]  you know, it sounds great, but four days for a grower is an eternity. I'm still trying
[05:58.480 --> 06:03.960]  to recover from that. And that third day you're like, I wonder if everything's alive. I wonder
[06:03.960 --> 06:07.240]  you won the flight. You're like, I just want to, can you just fly over my house? I just
[06:07.240 --> 06:11.440]  want to see if it burned down or something. You know, you're always got the worst ideas
[06:11.440 --> 06:18.080]  in your head. Adam, you've been working a lot, bro. What you working on, man? Just some
[06:18.080 --> 06:23.840]  grow up buildings. It's a, is it the one that we talked about last? Yeah. But so for the
[06:23.840 --> 06:27.560]  Denver Bud company, Denver Bud company, you guys are still putting that together. Yep.
[06:27.560 --> 06:33.880]  Do you know how many lights are going in there? More, a lot, a lot, more than a lot. I would
[06:33.880 --> 06:41.280]  say 55 to 75 per unit. Okay. Uh, I don't want to give exact units, but it's still single
[06:41.280 --> 06:47.760]  digit units. Sounds like you're a busy man. Yeah. Yeah. Putting in the hours. There was
[06:47.760 --> 06:52.560]  nothing there. And the guy that was there doing it, um, was there all alone. And I mean,
[06:52.560 --> 06:57.160]  I don't know if you've ever tried to do construction all alone, but it's hard. You can't really
[06:57.160 --> 07:01.440]  do a lot of construction by yourself. You're just slow cutting and doing and cutting and
[07:01.440 --> 07:06.400]  doing measure twice, cut once, nail it up, measure twice, cut once. And then you need
[07:06.400 --> 07:08.800]  someone to help you. It's easier if you've got someone to hold the shit. Right. When
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.880]  he told me, I literally laughed at him. I was like, Hey, that's great. Uh, but we, you
[07:13.880 --> 07:18.960]  know, it's, it's a good job. I can't, I can't bitch. And hopefully it holds out through
[07:18.960 --> 07:22.400]  the end of the month. Cause I really needed the stuff for the kids and Christmas. Oh,
[07:22.400 --> 07:27.480]  it's good timing. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I was kind of busy today myself, dude, today. I
[07:27.480 --> 07:31.480]  want to give a big shout out to my homie Spence. Uh, Spence and I had been talking
[07:31.480 --> 07:37.480]  about me learning how to make dabs because I smoke a lot of hash and I grow my own herb.
[07:37.480 --> 07:42.280]  I am sufficient all the way from, I can create my own seeds. I can germinate and I can grow
[07:42.280 --> 07:46.040]  the seeds. I can harvest it. I can trim it. Then I've got the product of that is done
[07:46.040 --> 07:50.160]  as flowers and trim. And then I like to smoke dabs. So I had to learn how to turn that into
[07:50.160 --> 07:55.080]  the dabs I want today. Spence spent about four or five hours teaching me how to do that.
[07:55.080 --> 07:59.840]  We ran a couple of batches. I got to run some tubes myself. Uh, I've got all the way
[07:59.840 --> 08:04.720]  up to the point when we put it in the vac oven. I understand all of that and I understand
[08:04.720 --> 08:08.720]  the vac oven. I just don't know the controls on the oven very well myself. Once I get that
[08:08.720 --> 08:12.840]  comfortable, I think I can make pretty good quality shatter. There's a batch of my shatter
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.680]  that I blasted sitting in the back of it right now waiting for me to check it out in about
[08:17.680 --> 08:22.680]  48 hours. Spence is going to flip it cause it's in his, uh, his facility, but I'm kind
[08:22.680 --> 08:26.520]  of proud. I'm kind of excited. That's awesome. Yeah. So we'll go from seed to shatter. It'll
[08:26.520 --> 08:30.640]  go all the way from the germination all the way to my dabber now. All in house. Yeah.
[08:30.640 --> 08:34.920]  Thanks. Thanks. So I don't know about congrats yet. I, uh, I've watched and tried once. It's
[08:34.920 --> 08:38.520]  an experimental process. Yeah. I mean, just trying to learn something. Yeah. Uh, getting
[08:38.520 --> 08:41.960]  out of the comfort zone. I've been really, I, I was comfortable. I realized that was
[08:41.960 --> 08:46.880]  comfortable for a year. Like I've, I had iRegenetics go and I haven't done anything for a year.
[08:46.880 --> 08:50.840]  I've got, I've expanded and learned and grown, but now I've got this new grow facility with
[08:50.840 --> 08:54.600]  227 lights. Now I'm learning how to make hash. I'm definitely getting out of the comfort
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.480]  zone. Yeah. Nothing's more comfortable than just blasting a QP. Like, yeah, let's see
[08:59.480 --> 09:03.400]  what happens. Let's see if I can make hash. Yeah. Throw down three ounces of your favorite
[09:03.400 --> 09:08.520]  lemon Jeffrey and just run it and see what happens. Yeah. My forearms are a little, uh,
[09:08.520 --> 09:12.880]  there's a lot of work involved. Yeah. It's not as easy as you might think. Uh, speaking
[09:12.880 --> 09:17.560]  of me making dabs, uh, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at highly educated
[09:17.560 --> 09:22.080]  titanium. If you're using high quality concentrates made by Rasta Jeff or garden of Wheaton, or
[09:22.080 --> 09:26.200]  even this water hash, a solvent list, what do you call it? Sean? Full melt, full melt
[09:26.200 --> 09:29.880]  hash that Sean made and brought over that stuff is tasty and dank. You deserve a high
[09:29.880 --> 09:34.520]  quality titanium nail that's made right here in America. They're made in Provo, Utah by
[09:34.520 --> 09:38.960]  our good friend task rock. Don't trust a cheap Chinese nail. Don't trust an American knockoff
[09:38.960 --> 09:43.800]  made of cheap crappy metals. Trust the industry leader, the innovator, the Kings trust, our
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.560]  good friends, highly educated titanium. Make sure you check out highly educated, ti.com.

[10:02.000 --> 10:06.120]  I think every dabber would like a brand new titanium nail. Uh, they've got a nail little
[10:06.120 --> 10:11.520]  fit your 14 and your 18 millimeter rig. They've got one old fit your 10, uh, your 11 and your
[10:11.520 --> 10:15.200]  12 and get a carb cap to go with that. I think that would make anybody at this table
[10:15.200 --> 10:19.200]  pretty happy. If you got a nail and a carb cap in the mail. Yeah. See everybody looked
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.640]  at me like, I don't have one for you. They've got cool colors. Now you do have cool colors.
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.160]  Sean's is kind of, is that purple? Would you call that pink? This one right here is a purple.
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.160]  So yours is pink. Yeah. Well it's pink though. Thank you. And then I got a blue one too.
[10:32.160 --> 10:37.840]  Sorry. I'm spoiled guys. I got multiple colors. There's nothing. You're manly as fuck for
[10:37.840 --> 10:42.000]  carrying that pink one around with pride. Yeah. Torch. Jeez. This guy's dick must be
[10:42.000 --> 10:50.160]  huge. Speaking of big dicks, make sure you check out highly educated titanium.com. I
[10:50.160 --> 10:54.000]  also want to give a big thanks to Adams right in front of me, dude. Thank you. You helped
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.720]  me out a whole fucking bunch. You helped me transplant a large number of plants and it
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.600]  took us hours and I appreciate that. Also shout out to Mike. Mike helped a lot. We got
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.840]  our fingernails real dirty. We got sweaty. I made these guys listen to reggae and then
[11:07.840 --> 11:13.360]  we got tired and something really weird happened at the grow. I blasted Pantera as loud as
[11:13.360 --> 11:17.760]  it would freaking go for a good album worth. And that's really out of character for me,
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.640]  but it got us pumped up. We were a little bit getting burned out and that Pantera really
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.080]  got the mosh pit in the room going. It was at the point where there's like, where's the
[11:25.080 --> 11:30.360]  rest of the work? And there was no more work. So yeah, it worked. It went pretty quickly.
[11:30.360 --> 11:33.520]  You guys knocked it out. So huge. Thanks dude. I could have done. It took the three
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.960]  of us most of the night. So imagine watching me try to do that myself. As I've said, it's
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.040]  a learning process for me. So I'm going to do a couple of quick ads and then we'll keep
[11:40.040 --> 11:42.920]  this going. I'm trying to keep the momentum going in the conversation. This podcast is

[12:46.000 --> 12:52.120]  to Maddie. She's grown an experimental strain. I think I saw that. Did you see that? It's
[12:52.200 --> 12:57.560]  the, uh, the girl scout cookies crossed to the King Kim grape stomper OG and she killed
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.320]  it bro. Uh, Maddie got her own little grow space over at the garden of Whedon and she
[13:01.320 --> 13:05.880]  put some of my seeds in there and they look freaking marvelous. So good job, Maddie. I'm
[13:05.880 --> 13:10.960]  proud of you. They look great. I got to meet them, uh, at a weekend. And like I said, it
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.360]  was a pleasure to meet them. I got smell finally. Some of the stuff that I've been looking at
[13:15.360 --> 13:18.920]  Instagram for the past three months. So do you want to give you Jesse a shout out for
[13:18.920 --> 13:23.960]  absolutely Jesse, you know, thank you for letting me and my wife get out of the house
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.160]  for a change and you know, putting it, putting me to work so I can pay some bills for sure.
[13:29.200 --> 13:33.280]  But Thanksgiving though, he invited you to dinner. Yeah, he did. He's got everybody blazed
[13:33.800 --> 13:38.760]  Medicaid and food. Yeah. You have no idea. You should have game. Sorry. By the time I
[13:38.760 --> 13:43.320]  was able to go, it was wrapping up. I was like ready to go. Thanksgiving was what the
[13:43.320 --> 13:46.960]  phrase was by the time I wanted to go. They weren't given anymore. Speaking of Jesse,

[14:52.120 --> 14:58.200]  got. There you go. Uh, Adam, do a dab while he does a dab. I'll give you a little dab
[14:58.200 --> 15:02.640]  right here. And I can just let me try the live resume. Yeah, that one's alive right

[15:15.920 --> 15:21.880]  news and reviews. Www.tree thugger.com. I'm going to go see the string cheese incident
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.960]  on new year's Eve for all three nights. Uh, you guarantee there'll be some shit about
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.240]  that on tree thugger.com. I won't write it, but I know that that shit will be up there
[15:30.240 --> 15:33.600]  because a lot of the hippies will like it, bro. You can put the rig by the, by the mic.
[15:33.600 --> 15:36.480]  Nobody minds here. And that makes them feel like they're there with us listening to your
[15:36.480 --> 15:41.320]  torch. Um, also I'm going to read part of an email. I want to give a shout out. So that's
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.800]  all the commercials guys. If you're fast forwarding through commercials, you can stop right now
[15:44.800 --> 15:49.160]  and just listen to this part. I'm going to find my phone. Um, I have a couple of notes
[15:49.160 --> 15:52.360]  on my phone that I want to make sure I read. Go ahead. Adam, you got something for me?
[15:52.360 --> 15:56.760]  I, um, I went on the forums the other day and I was just looking through there. It seems
[15:56.760 --> 16:01.800]  like you're getting more response on the forums as well. Uh, it's not like a dramatic, but
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.200]  when I logged in, there was only like X amount of users and now there's, you know, a little
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.320]  bit more than double. I think I've been pulled and you can't say just a little because every
[16:10.320 --> 16:14.320]  one of those people I'm fucking grateful for. I don't say there's only 63. I say there
[16:14.320 --> 16:18.600]  are fucking 63. Yay. And I don't, I'm making up a number, but I'm excited for each one
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.120]  of them. Like I, and he's talking about the I read genetics, Colorado website forum. So
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.080]  that's, I post a lot of stuff there. I haven't been there for like a week because I got this
[16:27.080 --> 16:30.440]  new job and I've been kind of scrambling to get a whole bunch of shit done before I start
[16:30.440 --> 16:34.480]  there. But trust me, I'll be back. I live on that website sometimes. I want to give
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.440]  a shout out to our good friend, Jake. Jake sent me an email. Uh, I kind of can't read
[16:39.560 --> 16:42.640]  the whole thing because of some of the stuff that he says. He kind of asked me not to say
[16:42.640 --> 16:48.320]  some stuff that he wrote, but he ends this with a congrats on the new job and keep up
[16:48.320 --> 16:52.960]  the good work. You're doing your part in making my 12 hour shift bearable. And for that, I
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.680]  am grateful. So big up dude. Thanks for the compliments. That kind of stuff right there
[16:57.680 --> 17:01.960]  makes the hours that I put into this show worth it. It makes these guys come in. John
[17:01.960 --> 17:05.120]  puts part of his day aside to come here and hang out. Adam has to break away from his
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.120]  family. Jesse's got a construction company, a grow business, a hydro shop. These guys
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.520]  have to break away from their lives. So hearing these compliments really lets us know that
[17:12.520 --> 17:16.600]  you're loving it. It makes it worth it. Honestly, it makes it to me and I'd do it even if he
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.400]  didn't, but it really, it's like, yay, someone's listening. So big shout out to Jake. I appreciate
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.120]  it, bro. That's pretty awesome that you did that. And I won't say the rest of your message
[17:24.120 --> 17:29.800]  because you said some cool stuff that I don't need to say. Um, I've got more stuff written
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.560]  down. Let's get into the news. You guys want to talk some news real quick or do you want
[17:32.560 --> 17:35.800]  me to ask Sean questions? There's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of cool stuff. Sean will
[17:35.800 --> 17:38.720]  have an opinion on this. I just want to give Sean some room to talk. He's patient and quiet
[17:38.720 --> 17:43.080]  over there, nice and polite. Uh, in local news, I hope you guys have an opinion on this.
[17:43.080 --> 17:46.800]  It's not really cannabis related, but the Westboro Baptist church is coming to our town
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.380]  to picket at our courthouse and at two local dispensaries. They're coming here because
[17:51.380 --> 17:58.840]  our town, uh, supports gay rights. We have a, uh, a gay woman who is one of our, uh,
[17:58.840 --> 18:04.160]  representatives and she's a cool ass lady and I support her in every way. And the web,
[18:04.160 --> 18:10.080]  uh, Westboro Baptist church wants to come here and protest us because we have gay rights
[18:10.080 --> 18:13.080]  here. And then once they're done protesting at our courthouse, they're going to go to
[18:13.080 --> 18:19.120]  two dispensaries and protest over there in Pueblo West. Um, I'm flattered you guys are
[18:19.120 --> 18:23.680]  coming, but fuck off. We don't need you. We are our own town. We're adults. Uh, what are
[18:23.680 --> 18:28.560]  you going to do to go worry about your own damn town? Do that over there. Yeah, it's
[18:28.560 --> 18:34.600]  just hate. Yeah, it's hate. Those people are crazy. Yeah. And in my opinion, no matter
[18:34.600 --> 18:38.360]  what religion you are, no matter what you believe in, I think be kind and love everybody
[18:38.360 --> 18:41.600]  is what you're supposed to do. And they're being very hypocritical. They're not being
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.880]  kind. They're not loving anybody. They're preaching hate. They're driving from another,
[18:45.880 --> 18:51.920]  they're driving from Kansas to come to Colorado to show how angry they are at us. I didn't
[18:51.920 --> 18:55.520]  realize they were that close. Get a life. That's how I feel about that. Absolutely.
[18:55.520 --> 19:01.720]  Like don't you have some shit to do at home? I bet that while I can't be presumptuous,
[19:01.720 --> 19:04.640]  that's all right. I can, but I'm going to do it. I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.200]  Do you think that while mom and dad are here protesting that little Jimmy smoking a joint
[19:09.200 --> 19:13.840]  in Kansas and little Sarah's getting butt fucked by Jimmy's older brother? I've definitely
[19:13.840 --> 19:17.880]  if not much weirder shit going on because it's Kansas, right? The brother and sister
[19:17.880 --> 19:21.240]  are just getting it in the living room while the parents are here protesting. I've seen,
[19:21.240 --> 19:25.160]  I hope their children that they have out there, their kids are getting gay and smoking weed
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.600]  while they're here protesting, watching duck dynasty, watching duck dynasty, watching porn,
[19:30.600 --> 19:36.320]  getting gay, smoking weed, drinking forties, uh, wearing camo, saying the N word, but not
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.840]  in a racial word, calling out, calling each other. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's cool. Like it's
[19:40.840 --> 19:43.800]  cool. I hope that's what your kids are doing while you're here. And then as soon as you
[19:43.800 --> 19:48.640]  get home, it's back to the polo shirts and yes mama, but I truly am flattered. There
[19:48.640 --> 19:51.560]  are a lot of places for them to go and they chose here because we have gay rights and
[19:51.560 --> 19:56.120]  cannabis. I just figured they'd run it out. They're running out of places to go. I don't
[19:56.120 --> 19:59.960]  want to be offensive to a lot of people. Just, just the West. I can't even say the name of
[19:59.960 --> 20:03.600]  them. They bother me so much. Just this one group. They just piss me off. I know I've
[20:03.600 --> 20:08.640]  said a lot of roots. I kind of wanted to know the name of the dispensary side. Be like,
[20:08.640 --> 20:11.920]  they're going to Marisol is the first one they listed. You know what? I think I took
[20:11.920 --> 20:17.480]  a screenshot of the article here because that's how I was just saving news on my phone. No,
[20:17.480 --> 20:20.120]  I didn't take a screenshot of the article, but I know they're going to Marisol and one
[20:20.120 --> 20:25.040]  other one. Uh, and if you said the name of it, it may be Pueblo West organics actually,
[20:25.040 --> 20:28.960]  but it was not the spot. Shout out to the spot. That's the spot that I would represent.
[20:28.960 --> 20:32.820]  They should go there. That's where the good weed's going to be. So that's our local news.
[20:32.820 --> 20:38.560]  In bigger news, Colorado is being sued by, I'm looking for the article on my phone. Colorado
[20:38.560 --> 20:42.400]  is being sued by the States of Nebraska and Oklahoma. Have you heard about this yet? No,
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.600]  not yet. Cool. Sean's lighting a joint over there. He looks like he's ready for this story.
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.280]  Uh, today the States of Nebraska and Oklahoma announced that they have filed lawsuits against
[20:49.440 --> 20:54.000]  Colorado alleging that Colorado's amendment 64 is unconstitutional. Colorado's attorney,
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  general John Southers issued the following statement in response because neighboring
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.080]  States have expressed concern about Colorado grown marijuana coming into their States.
[21:02.080 --> 21:06.080]  We are not entirely surprised by this action. However, it appears the plaintiff's primary
[21:06.080 --> 21:10.080]  grievance stems from a non-enforcement of federal laws regarding marijuana,
[21:10.080 --> 21:15.280]  as opposed to choices made by the others of Colorado. We believe this suit is without merit
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.120]  and we will vigorously defend it against it in the U S Supreme court.
[21:19.840 --> 21:25.840]  So Nebraska and Oklahoma are trying to sue Colorado because we are not following federal
[21:25.840 --> 21:30.080]  rule. They're going to try to force the feds to come in here and clean up the weed scene that
[21:30.080 --> 21:34.800]  we've created. They're jelly. All that money. You think they're jelly? No, I don't think that,
[21:34.800 --> 21:39.840]  but those aren't States that this place, they're not very popular in the first place. I don't
[21:39.840 --> 21:43.600]  think they're really worried about that. Yeah. Those are places that pretty much lock you up
[21:43.600 --> 21:49.280]  forever for having herb. They don't like it at all there. And I know it's happening because I
[21:49.280 --> 21:52.960]  know people, we read about them getting busted all the time. People are definitely driving
[21:53.760 --> 21:57.600]  pounds, pounds and pounds out of this state because we're able to produce it.
[21:57.600 --> 22:00.320]  Yeah. But do you really think it was any more than before?
[22:00.880 --> 22:05.360]  Yes. There is more cannabis. Smaller amounts.
[22:06.400 --> 22:10.800]  Well, when more personal, were you here for the wild, wild West revolution that I talk about
[22:10.800 --> 22:14.800]  when everybody got a red card and there was nobody to care to regulate it and everybody just
[22:14.800 --> 22:18.560]  grew? Yeah. When I first got here, at least when I first got here, there wasn't the whole badge
[22:18.560 --> 22:21.760]  system or anything like that. Anybody could, I worked at the dispensary.
[22:21.760 --> 22:25.440]  And you could grow, I could walk into your shop with a backpack full of quarter pounds and sell
[22:25.440 --> 22:31.680]  them to you. Right? Yeah. So imagine if you were getting, here it was seven to eight, maybe nine,
[22:31.680 --> 22:36.800]  if you could really hustle the shop for a quarter pound. But I know friends that will maybe send
[22:36.880 --> 22:42.240]  shit to the East coast and they can get 15 for that same quarter pound to their cousin that live,
[22:42.240 --> 22:46.000]  or their brother that lives out there. And they just don't give a shit. They're like, why not?
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.800]  And they'll just send it or drive it out there. And what's to, if you're a 20 something year old
[22:50.800 --> 22:54.160]  kid with no kids, what's to stop you? I guess my point of view is just the weeds.
[22:54.800 --> 22:58.000]  It's either going to come from California, it's going to come from Washington, or it's going to
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.160]  come from Colorado. So I feel like the weeds just going to be moving across those States anyways,
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.000]  regardless of whether they sue us, it'll just go right back to wherever they were getting it from.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.480]  I think the solution would just be a nationwide legalization, you know, medicine without borders.
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.520]  Oh, did we just start a new, a new program, medicine without borders?
[23:15.520 --> 23:18.240]  You just make it known. And we'll just drive around your fucking state.
[23:20.160 --> 23:23.040]  They're talking about giving it to a convicts and stuff too.
[23:23.040 --> 23:24.480]  Spin your mic a little towards your face, please.
[23:24.480 --> 23:26.960]  They're talking about giving it to convicts as well.
[23:26.960 --> 23:28.480]  Hear how rich you sound. Yeah, rich.
[23:28.480 --> 23:29.840]  Yeah. You sound like you're up in there.
[23:29.840 --> 23:31.120]  Up in there. Get it.
[23:31.120 --> 23:34.640]  I like it. So anyways, they're talking about giving it to convicts.
[23:34.640 --> 23:36.640]  We might've taken a lot of dabs before this show.
[23:37.840 --> 23:38.800]  And I think that would help.
[23:39.840 --> 23:40.720]  Yeah. Yeah.
[23:40.720 --> 23:41.600]  Convicts.
[23:41.600 --> 23:47.040]  Just in jail, bro. Just, I think that what you saw was on the onion and I don't think that that was wrong.
[23:47.040 --> 23:49.520]  I don't know. Christy pointed it out to me.
[23:49.520 --> 23:52.720]  Oh, that, yeah. Consider your source, bro.
[23:52.720 --> 23:53.280]  All right, cool.
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.560]  I didn't read a source. I just kind of fucking internet.
[23:57.760 --> 23:59.920]  Yeah. He could be right, but I'm pretty sure.
[23:59.920 --> 24:02.160]  All I know is that I've, you know,
[24:02.560 --> 24:05.920]  spend a little bit of time and weed makes it not right.
[24:05.920 --> 24:07.520]  It makes it not so annoying.
[24:07.520 --> 24:08.720]  Oh yeah. The loudness in the.
[24:08.720 --> 24:10.960]  Well, that's why weed cures, helps with depression.
[24:10.960 --> 24:12.720]  It makes things that suck not as.
[24:12.720 --> 24:13.520]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[24:13.520 --> 24:16.000]  That's why people get, have to work at Taco Bell all day,
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.800]  get fucking blazed right before they go to Taco Bell all day.
[24:18.800 --> 24:20.640]  Then when you try to order your food.
[24:20.640 --> 24:22.080]  I don't even want to go off onto that rant.
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.360]  The guy at Subway the other day was way higher than we were.
[24:26.080 --> 24:27.120]  And that's saying something.
[24:29.200 --> 24:30.560]  Yeah. There's a time and place for that.
[24:30.560 --> 24:31.360]  I've got an article.
[24:32.240 --> 24:34.560]  Um, I hope I saved it.
[24:34.560 --> 24:36.080]  Oh, look, it's refreshing.
[24:36.080 --> 24:37.600]  We might not have internet service.
[24:38.640 --> 24:40.080]  Come on computer.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.840]  If that happens, then we're making a 45 minute video on.
[24:46.400 --> 24:47.280]  How bad it sucks.
[24:47.840 --> 24:48.880]  How bad the internet sucks?
[24:48.880 --> 24:51.120]  Yeah. Oh, look, there's not another internet company.
[24:51.120 --> 24:52.640]  Is there? No, no.
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.480]  Yeah. We don't get an option in our area.
[24:54.480 --> 24:55.920]  We get one provider.
[24:55.920 --> 25:00.000]  So a little less anxiety for medical marijuana States on F on a federal level
[25:00.000 --> 25:00.960]  is the next article here.
[25:00.960 --> 25:03.600]  It's from the cannabis and it's published December 12th.
[25:03.600 --> 25:06.160]  And it's from Kyle Potter of the Associated Press.
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.880]  And it says buried deep inside the 1,600 page funding bill.
[25:10.880 --> 25:13.920]  Congress is scrambling to pass to avert a shutdown.
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.280]  A few lines can form.
[25:15.280 --> 25:15.920]  Come.
[25:15.920 --> 25:16.960]  Sorry. Let me try that again.
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.800]  A few lines comforted Minnesota officials worried about the federal government cracking
[25:20.800 --> 25:23.360]  down on the state's new medical marijuana program.
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.000]  I'm going to kind of skim a little bit here because I want to get to more of this stuff.
[25:26.000 --> 25:27.040]  I just wanted to read this one.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.400]  In its current form, the $1.1 trillion spending bill includes a section that
[25:32.400 --> 25:36.000]  bans the department of justice from using federal funds to intervene with
[25:36.000 --> 25:37.920]  States with medical marijuana laws.
[25:38.880 --> 25:40.000]  That's the best part right there.
[25:40.000 --> 25:41.920]  I can almost stop the whole article right there.
[25:41.920 --> 25:44.960]  So what that says is I'm going to read it again in its current form,
[25:44.960 --> 25:47.920]  the $1.1 trillion spending bill.
[25:47.920 --> 25:50.720]  And wrap your money name, wrap your head around that fucking number real quick.
[25:50.720 --> 25:52.480]  $1.1 trillion.
[25:52.480 --> 25:56.720]  But then it says bans the department of justice from using federal funds
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.080]  to intervene in States with medical marijuana laws, which means they can't fuck with us now.
[26:02.080 --> 26:05.760]  I mean, they can, because they'll find a way, but they're not going to mess with the States.
[26:05.760 --> 26:08.240]  They're not going to try to come and make us switch our laws back.
[26:08.240 --> 26:10.800]  They're not going to, I don't think they're going to continue with raids.
[26:10.800 --> 26:12.640]  There's still going to be illegal grow ups.
[26:12.640 --> 26:15.200]  There's still going to be illegal stuff going on that they're going to have to.
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.360]  It says 23 States have legalized medical marijuana, but those measures still conflict
[26:21.360 --> 26:22.640]  with federal law.
[26:22.640 --> 26:26.000]  And though the Obama administration has generally been friendlier to marijuana
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.280]  than administrations past, Munson Regala wondered what if that changes or a new president
[26:31.280 --> 26:33.680]  changes course.
[26:33.680 --> 26:38.000]  The US House narrowly passed the funding bill with the medical marijuana section Thursday.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.560]  This Senate was expected to take it up Friday.
[26:41.600 --> 26:46.320]  So he doubts the bill will markedly change the government's handling of the issue.
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.560]  Most attorneys have indicated they won't go after medical marijuana businesses,
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.960]  as long as they're following state laws.
[26:52.960 --> 26:55.040]  So the point is, I think it gives them a little more comfort.
[26:55.040 --> 26:58.080]  And I wouldn't say it gives very much more comfort, but you never know.
[26:58.080 --> 27:00.880]  He continued, the bottom line is it's still illegal under federal law.
[27:00.880 --> 27:04.000]  So anything could happen, but they don't have funding.
[27:04.000 --> 27:04.960]  So what are they going to do?
[27:04.960 --> 27:07.760]  These cops aren't going to go and raid shit on their own time, are they?
[27:07.760 --> 27:10.000]  There was a cop in California that did.
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.800]  But I mean, then you're also, if a cop's going to go off and do that on his own time
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.200]  without support, he may be looking for that lucrative income.
[27:19.200 --> 27:20.880]  Yeah, that's not going to fly in Colorado though.
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.560]  No, no, no, but I'm just saying, yeah, it sounds like to me, it's going to lead to bad
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.280]  cops.
[27:25.280 --> 27:25.680]  All right.
[27:25.680 --> 27:27.360]  So we've gone like 25 minutes.
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.240]  Let's get into some talk about this organic stuff.
[27:30.240 --> 27:33.360]  I want to make sure that I got through all the important part, paid all the bills.
[27:33.360 --> 27:33.920]  Yeah, I'm good.
[27:33.920 --> 27:34.800]  I'm caught up.
[27:34.800 --> 27:35.520]  I'm paying attention.
[27:35.520 --> 27:36.320]  I got notes and shit.
[27:36.320 --> 27:38.240]  You guys, this is like almost a real show.
[27:38.240 --> 27:39.680]  You wouldn't even believe it.
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.000]  Episode 50 is coming up and I'm getting excited, starting to think about what we can give away.
[27:44.560 --> 27:47.520]  Hey, Jesse, if you're listening, dude, remember you guys kind of volunteered to give some shit
[27:47.520 --> 27:48.240]  away on number 50.
[27:48.240 --> 27:49.120]  We got to talk about that.
[27:50.400 --> 27:52.080]  So you're going to say something, go for it.
[27:52.080 --> 27:56.160]  We've been kind of like trying to figure out what to give away.
[27:56.160 --> 27:56.640]  Nice.
[27:56.640 --> 28:00.560]  So he's been bouncing things off me and I've been bouncing things off him and he's like,
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.280]  go.
[28:01.280 --> 28:01.920]  Tweet us.
[28:01.920 --> 28:03.280]  Let us know what you want.
[28:03.280 --> 28:06.240]  If you guys are listening, tweet me at I grow culture or email me.
[28:06.240 --> 28:07.840]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[28:07.840 --> 28:11.040]  Let us know what you want for giveaway prizes and we'll see if we can accommodate you.
[28:11.840 --> 28:13.040]  So Sean's here.
[28:13.040 --> 28:16.080]  The guy that talked a whole bunch about cool organic shit, King Cola.
[28:16.080 --> 28:17.760]  You guys loved that show.
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.680]  Drying and curing and that organics episode have been my two most popular episodes out
[28:21.680 --> 28:23.040]  of 44 episodes.
[28:23.040 --> 28:23.600]  Awesome.
[28:23.600 --> 28:24.100]  Yeah.
[28:24.480 --> 28:25.280]  People learned a lot.
[28:25.920 --> 28:27.200]  People asked a lot of questions.
[28:27.200 --> 28:29.840]  I can't shout out everybody that emailed me, texted me,
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.120]  tweetered me because I would spend a whole show doing it, but we got a lot of response on that.
[28:35.120 --> 28:38.720]  I want to talk more about worm castings mostly because that's kind of what seemed to be the
[28:38.720 --> 28:41.520]  base of a lot of your stuff and a lot of what got the conversation going.
[28:42.640 --> 28:43.600]  I'm going to jump back.
[28:43.600 --> 28:45.200]  We were talking about worm castings.
[28:45.200 --> 28:49.440]  We've got for our basic tea, you said worm castings and molasses.
[28:49.600 --> 28:53.760]  You mentioned multiplying the protozoa is something that you really stressed.
[28:55.440 --> 28:58.960]  First of all, I guess my main question I should ask is what are protozoa?
[28:58.960 --> 29:02.160]  Protozoa are just other microorganisms.
[29:04.400 --> 29:06.400]  It's not just the protozoa, it's everything.
[29:06.400 --> 29:09.440]  It's all of the microbes in there.
[29:09.440 --> 29:10.080]  The bacillus.
[29:10.080 --> 29:10.580]  Yeah.
[29:11.120 --> 29:14.880]  So you've got fungi and bacteria and all of these beneficial things.
[29:14.880 --> 29:18.560]  You're just going to give them a food source and really give them a chance to thrive and grow.
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.560]  All of those things actually fall under the category of protozoa?
[29:22.560 --> 29:25.120]  No, the protozoa are a specific...
[29:26.960 --> 29:27.600]  I don't know.
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.080]  I can't think the term right off of my head, but yeah, it's just a certain
[29:32.080 --> 29:33.920]  microbe that lives in the soil.
[29:33.920 --> 29:34.160]  All right.
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.680]  That's one that I'd never really...
[29:35.680 --> 29:38.720]  I'd seen the word, but I never paid attention until you opened my mind to it.
[29:38.720 --> 29:39.520]  Actually, I had a...
[29:40.880 --> 29:46.160]  Since we're on the subject, we have been feeding our worms.
[29:46.160 --> 29:48.960]  We've been substituting alfalfa with cannabis.
[29:50.080 --> 29:50.560]  Nice.
[29:50.560 --> 29:50.800]  Yeah.
[29:50.800 --> 29:55.760]  We were donated a little over 3000 pounds of what we call cannameal, which is finely
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.600]  ground material from a local...
[29:58.800 --> 30:01.040]  Actually, I can open vape.
[30:01.040 --> 30:02.240]  Are you familiar with the company?
[30:02.240 --> 30:02.400]  No.
[30:02.400 --> 30:03.280]  They sell vapor pens.
[30:03.280 --> 30:03.840]  Okay.
[30:03.840 --> 30:07.520]  And Organa Labs, they donated the material by law.
[30:08.240 --> 30:12.560]  By state law, all dispensaries have to dispose of their waste.
[30:12.560 --> 30:16.480]  And unfortunately, a lot of people are just mixing it with old dirt and throwing it in
[30:16.480 --> 30:18.400]  a dumpster and then it's going to a landfill.
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.960]  We have been feeding it to our worms kind of as a test trial.
[30:23.840 --> 30:24.640]  Worms loved it.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.480]  They really did.
[30:27.520 --> 30:34.720]  We just got our test results back today, actually, and it was off the chart.
[30:34.720 --> 30:36.160]  I mean, it really was...
[30:37.840 --> 30:39.040]  See what we had on here.
[30:39.040 --> 30:39.520]  He's searching.
[30:39.520 --> 30:40.400]  You guys give him a second.
[30:40.400 --> 30:40.880]  Bear with him.
[30:40.880 --> 30:42.000]  He's digging through the iPhone.
[30:42.000 --> 30:42.880]  Always takes a minute.
[30:42.880 --> 30:47.600]  I mean, the Rocky Mountain Worm Company has definitely been the conversation at work for
[30:48.240 --> 30:49.040]  most of the week.
[30:49.040 --> 30:49.680]  Anyways.
[30:49.680 --> 30:50.400]  That's good to hear.
[30:50.400 --> 30:50.560]  Yeah.
[30:50.560 --> 30:57.520]  He really takes pride in what he does and he feeds his worms the highest quality, everything.
[30:57.520 --> 30:59.120]  And that seems to be the important part.
[30:59.120 --> 30:59.760]  It really is.
[31:02.240 --> 31:05.280]  He makes them produce what you want.
[31:05.280 --> 31:07.520]  Everybody's so focused on cost.
[31:07.520 --> 31:11.440]  Everybody wants the cheapest casting out there and they don't really understand that
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.040]  you're only hurting yourself.
[31:13.840 --> 31:17.600]  I keep saying, if you're going to cut costs in the grow, then cut the cost in the sale too.
[31:17.600 --> 31:17.920]  Exactly.
[31:17.920 --> 31:18.720]  And they don't want to do that.
[31:18.720 --> 31:20.960]  They want to cut costs in one end and it's not fair.
[31:20.960 --> 31:21.280]  Yeah.
[31:21.280 --> 31:29.680]  And with these castings, you can take a compost and cut 10 to 15% of the compost and then make
[31:29.680 --> 31:36.000]  your own vermicompost and then cut that in one part peat moss, one part aeration, one part
[31:36.000 --> 31:36.880]  vermicompost.
[31:36.880 --> 31:38.000]  There's your base soil.
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.440]  You can add in your amendments like your crab meal and your azomite and kelp and alfalfa,
[31:43.440 --> 31:44.400]  whatever you're going to add.
[31:45.920 --> 31:48.800]  There's your mixed soil and it's really that simple.
[31:49.440 --> 31:56.320]  But Jay's been feeding his worms cannabis plant matter and they have been freaking loving it.
[31:57.120 --> 31:59.280]  Test results were astronomical.
[31:59.920 --> 32:05.600]  Comparably to running the alfalfa, the biological life was off the charts.
[32:06.000 --> 32:16.720]  We gained hundreds of protozoa, fungi, bacteria, the active fungi, which means basically the
[32:17.840 --> 32:19.760]  things that are working in the soil.
[32:19.760 --> 32:25.440]  Before we had a higher fungal content, but that doesn't really mean much if they're not active.
[32:25.440 --> 32:28.000]  We have a lower fungal content, but more activity.
[32:28.000 --> 32:28.240]  Okay.
[32:28.240 --> 32:28.960]  If that makes more sense.
[32:28.960 --> 32:29.040]  Yeah.
[32:29.040 --> 32:30.080]  Oh, you want more bio life.
[32:30.080 --> 32:30.240]  Yeah.
[32:30.240 --> 32:32.320]  This stuff is so freaking biodiverse.
[32:32.320 --> 32:32.960]  It's amazing.
[32:32.960 --> 32:34.240]  We're so excited about it.
[32:34.400 --> 32:36.240]  Feeding a cannabis made it better.
[32:36.240 --> 32:40.720]  And now you're going to feed that to your cannabis and feed those leaves back to those worms.
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.400]  We're going to create a cycle.
[32:42.400 --> 32:43.280]  A closed loop growing system.
[32:43.280 --> 32:43.600]  Yeah.
[32:43.600 --> 32:44.080]  I like that.
[32:44.080 --> 32:45.920]  A closed loop, self-sustainable system.
[32:46.480 --> 32:48.240]  And we all got to get away from the bottles.
[32:48.960 --> 32:51.680]  I've been reading more about it since Sean kind of talked about it.
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.840]  And we're paying for shipping and water.
[32:53.840 --> 32:55.440]  That's what we're paying a lot of.
[32:55.440 --> 32:55.680]  Yeah.
[32:55.680 --> 33:00.800]  I was looking at the general organics label today, just kind of going over what was in it.
[33:00.800 --> 33:03.200]  And it's pretty amazing.
[33:03.200 --> 33:08.720]  I mean, there's just so much stuff in the label for, and there's really not that much in the
[33:08.720 --> 33:09.120]  bottle.
[33:09.120 --> 33:10.000]  It's pretty amazing.
[33:10.000 --> 33:14.400]  But they got to preserve it and they got to make it stable and it's got to be chelated or buffered
[33:14.400 --> 33:15.280]  or yeah.
[33:15.280 --> 33:18.800]  Then it's got to be shipped and it's got to be able to stay in different temperatures and it's
[33:18.800 --> 33:19.680]  got to have a shelf life.
[33:19.680 --> 33:23.280]  You could just make it yourself 24 hours before you use it.
[33:23.280 --> 33:25.120]  You can smell it and it's so much richer.
[33:25.120 --> 33:26.000]  It really is.
[33:26.000 --> 33:30.240]  And then you're not throwing away plastic for all the neighbors to see your freaking botanic
[33:30.240 --> 33:31.680]  care bottles in the trash can.
[33:31.680 --> 33:32.400]  They don't need that.
[33:33.360 --> 33:35.440]  So you talked about multiplying the protozoa.
[33:36.000 --> 33:37.360]  What's the best way to go about that?
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.000]  So basically you just need to give them a food source.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.600]  So when you mix your tea up, so basically what you're going to do is you're going to
[33:45.600 --> 33:49.040]  add in your worm castings and then you're going to put in your food source and that's-
[33:49.040 --> 33:50.640]  So I'm going to back up just for a second.
[33:50.640 --> 33:51.920]  We're using a five gallon bucket.
[33:51.920 --> 33:52.080]  Yeah.
[33:52.080 --> 33:53.120]  So a five gallon bucket.
[33:53.120 --> 33:55.760]  Like a nylon or something to keep all the stuff in?
[33:55.760 --> 33:59.600]  I preach free suspension teas, especially on a smaller scale.
[33:59.600 --> 34:02.960]  I mean, if you're not doing anything over 15 or 20 gallons, anything-
[34:02.960 --> 34:04.000]  Just throw all the shit right in there?
[34:04.000 --> 34:08.160]  Just throw it right in there and then stir it up and it's like top dressing.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.200]  It goes on kind of thick.
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.000]  Do you need to bubble it?
[34:10.000 --> 34:10.480]  Put a bubble?
[34:10.480 --> 34:11.520]  Yeah, you're going to want to bubble it.
[34:11.520 --> 34:17.120]  Five gallon bucket, you get your hopefully reverse osmosis water or at least let it bubble
[34:17.120 --> 34:22.560]  for a couple of days, get the air out and then put all your worm castings, your molasses
[34:22.560 --> 34:24.080]  and whatever else you decide to put in there.
[34:24.080 --> 34:24.720]  Exactly.
[34:24.720 --> 34:26.400]  You can expand on it as you please.
[34:26.400 --> 34:28.000]  We've talked about a lot of cool shit to put in there.
[34:28.000 --> 34:28.960]  I hope you're paying attention.
[34:28.960 --> 34:29.760]  Yeah, basically, yeah.
[34:29.760 --> 34:33.280]  So you get your bucket, you get your air stones, the castings and molasses.
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.600]  You're going to throw that in there and you're going to just want to brew it from 12 to 24
[34:37.600 --> 34:38.000]  hours.
[34:38.000 --> 34:41.840]  I really wouldn't recommend taking it anything over that if you're not familiar with brewing.
[34:41.840 --> 34:44.880]  Set it on something you guys, it's going to bubble up and hopefully it's going to bubble
[34:44.880 --> 34:46.000]  up huge and make a huge bubbly mess.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.200]  And if you do have a big problem with the foam, it's as simple as dropping a little
[34:49.200 --> 34:52.000]  bit of coconut oil in there and then it's just gone.
[34:52.000 --> 34:52.480]  Nice.
[34:52.480 --> 34:54.000]  So I did not know that.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.600]  Yeah, I've made plenty of mess.
[34:55.600 --> 34:57.920]  I used to grow on like carpet and stuff like that.
[34:57.920 --> 34:59.040]  I've seen some of your pictures.
[34:59.040 --> 34:59.540]  Yeah.
[35:00.880 --> 35:01.280]  All right.
[35:01.280 --> 35:04.960]  So we just want to feed them and put them in a bucket and give them some oxygen and
[35:04.960 --> 35:05.840]  they will multiply.
[35:06.480 --> 35:07.680]  Do you know the ratio they multiply?
[35:07.680 --> 35:10.560]  Are we going to give them like 10,000 times or a thousand times more?
[35:10.560 --> 35:13.120]  You're going to get thousands and thousands of times more.
[35:13.120 --> 35:14.560]  It's pretty amazing.
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.800]  Check out anybody who's listening that's interested in this, like Google microbe man,
[35:18.800 --> 35:26.000]  and he's got amazing articles about brew times and how you can take them longer for more
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.080]  fungal dominant teas, shorter times for more bacterial dominant teas, how you can actually
[35:32.240 --> 35:38.400]  kind of cook your or inoculate your ingredients for your compost tea to make them more fungal
[35:38.400 --> 35:38.800]  dominant.
[35:38.800 --> 35:42.880]  So you can take your earthworm castings and sprinkle in a little bit of oatmeal.
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.080]  So let's say that you're going to use three cups.
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.760]  So I made, for example, I mixed a 15 gallon tea earlier.
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.400]  I use three and three quarters cups of worm castings.
[35:54.720 --> 35:56.160]  And I knew I was going to use that much.
[35:56.160 --> 35:59.120]  So what I did is I took that three and three quarters cup of worm castings and put it in
[35:59.120 --> 36:05.280]  a Mason jar, added some O'Brien, sprayed it with a water bottle and sealed it up about
[36:05.280 --> 36:06.480]  two days ago.
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.400]  And then today I went down into my basement and cracked it open and it smelled sweet.
[36:10.400 --> 36:13.120]  It was covered in white, you know, bacteria.
[36:13.680 --> 36:19.040]  And I use that for my tea and that's a way to fungal charge the shit out of your tea.
[36:19.040 --> 36:19.280]  Yeah.
[36:19.280 --> 36:19.920]  It sounds like it.
[36:19.920 --> 36:20.320]  Wow.
[36:20.320 --> 36:21.040]  That's pretty sweet.
[36:21.040 --> 36:23.200]  And cannabis plants love fungal dominance.
[36:23.200 --> 36:26.560]  And so that's going to make, instead of those little scraggly, shitty roots you see, it's
[36:26.560 --> 36:28.960]  going to make big, thick white spaghetti for roots, right?
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.440]  Exactly.
[36:30.960 --> 36:36.080]  You know, when you do the free suspension teas and you kind of get messy, your drip
[36:36.080 --> 36:37.280]  trays will fill up with dirt.
[36:37.280 --> 36:39.120]  You know how it gets at the end of the day.
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.000]  And I've seen my roots will grow right into that dirt, the bottom of the pot.
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.600]  I mean, they just can't get enough of it.
[36:46.720 --> 36:48.320]  I'm definitely, I need to go.
[36:48.320 --> 36:49.680]  So the store is in Colorado Springs.
[36:49.680 --> 36:51.280]  I live about 45 minutes away from there.
[36:51.280 --> 36:53.280]  I'm going to plan a trip up there quite soon.
[36:53.840 --> 36:57.680]  I hear within the next week, I've got some freshly transplanted stuff that I want to
[36:57.680 --> 36:59.680]  feed some Rocky Mountain worm tea.
[37:00.640 --> 37:02.080]  You keep talking about azomite.
[37:02.080 --> 37:05.840]  Do I want, I've always thought of azomite as something I wanted to add during flower.
[37:05.840 --> 37:08.000]  Do I want that in my veg phase as well?
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.560]  You know, really it's just more for flower.
[37:10.560 --> 37:14.400]  If you're going to mix it in with your soil, which most people will do, or they'll have
[37:14.400 --> 37:17.120]  some sort of amendment similar in their soil.
[37:17.120 --> 37:17.760]  That makes sense.
[37:17.920 --> 37:23.760]  So I really wouldn't recommend it until you're flowering, especially if you're not transplanting
[37:23.760 --> 37:24.080]  really.
[37:26.080 --> 37:26.400]  All right.
[37:26.400 --> 37:26.640]  Yeah.
[37:26.640 --> 37:29.120]  These, these plants I'm doing now are going to finish in their little pots.
[37:29.120 --> 37:29.280]  Yeah.
[37:29.280 --> 37:34.080]  The azomite, I know a lot of people who will do a worm castings, grow Kashi and azomite
[37:34.080 --> 37:35.680]  every two weeks as a top dress.
[37:35.680 --> 37:37.440]  I need to learn more about the Kashi.
[37:37.440 --> 37:38.720]  Everybody's all grow Kashi.
[37:38.720 --> 37:39.200]  Yeah.
[37:39.200 --> 37:40.480]  I think, I don't know.
[37:40.480 --> 37:44.320]  The grow Kashi is really cool, but I feel like a lot of people are using it just to
[37:44.320 --> 37:44.720]  use it.
[37:44.720 --> 37:47.200]  I don't know if they really understand what they're using it for.
[37:47.760 --> 37:56.000]  The idea is that it's lactic acid bacteria, it's photosynthetic bacteria, it's yeast,
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.320]  it's a lot of other things going on in there.
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.320]  And you're going to introduce that into your root zone, into your plant.
[38:02.320 --> 38:09.280]  And the grow Kashi will actually help digest old root parts and mats and things that are
[38:09.280 --> 38:11.120]  sitting in your soil, kind of stagnant.
[38:11.120 --> 38:12.160]  Sort of like enzymes would.
[38:12.160 --> 38:13.040]  Exactly.
[38:13.040 --> 38:14.560]  Exactly like enzymes would.
[38:14.560 --> 38:14.720]  Yeah.
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.120]  I mean, I can show you how to kick that bottle though.
[38:17.120 --> 38:18.160]  I grow zyme.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.920]  It's as simple as sprouting some seeds.
[38:19.920 --> 38:20.480]  Okay.
[38:20.480 --> 38:22.080]  See, there's something else I'm going to learn.
[38:22.080 --> 38:24.720]  It's going to take me a little bit of time, but eventually I'm going to get away from
[38:24.720 --> 38:26.160]  all the bottled nutrients.
[38:26.160 --> 38:27.280]  It's a little overwhelming at first.
[38:27.280 --> 38:30.960]  It's funny because I taught Adam how to grow mostly with full bottled stuff and he's over
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.640]  there shaking his head like I have to read that.
[38:32.640 --> 38:36.720]  I saw the seed process the other day and it just clicked.
[38:36.720 --> 38:40.800]  I compare it to like cooking, you know, like when you first start cooking and you look
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.560]  at recipes online and stuff, they're freaking overwhelming because they're
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.840]  so many things that go into it.
[38:47.840 --> 38:53.840]  But once you, you know, your cabinet's filled with all those spices, it's nothing.
[38:53.840 --> 38:56.720]  It takes five minutes to, you know, whip up a meal.
[38:56.720 --> 38:58.160]  And it's the same thing with the teas.
[38:58.160 --> 39:03.600]  It's overwhelming at first, but once you have castings of molasses and kelp and hydroslate
[39:03.600 --> 39:06.800]  and everything that you use, it's really nothing.
[39:06.800 --> 39:08.480]  And then you're buying all those things in bulk.
[39:08.480 --> 39:10.800]  So you're getting them at a fraction of the cost.
[39:11.760 --> 39:13.520]  Without water weight for shipping too.
[39:13.520 --> 39:13.840]  Yeah.
[39:14.160 --> 39:19.680]  And you can buy everything locally between Jesse at Hydro and then Jay up at Rocky Mount
[39:19.680 --> 39:20.800]  Worm Company.
[39:20.800 --> 39:23.840]  There's yeah, there's absolutely no reason to buy anything online.
[39:23.840 --> 39:25.440]  When's a good time for me to drop in man?
[39:26.480 --> 39:27.520]  Monday through Friday.
[39:27.520 --> 39:27.840]  Okay.
[39:27.840 --> 39:28.000]  Yeah.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.040]  He's always up there.
[39:29.040 --> 39:29.280]  Cool.
[39:29.280 --> 39:30.000]  Midday.
[39:30.000 --> 39:30.560]  I like it.
[39:30.560 --> 39:31.360]  That's about my style.
[39:31.360 --> 39:32.560]  Monday through Friday, midday.
[39:32.560 --> 39:34.000]  I don't do things too damn early.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.800]  But yeah, he's always up there.
[39:36.800 --> 39:37.680]  11 to 1.
[39:37.680 --> 39:38.080]  Yeah.
[39:38.080 --> 39:39.680]  Lunchtime is when I do business.
[39:39.680 --> 39:42.240]  You need to stop up there and check out these can of castings.
[39:42.240 --> 39:43.600]  They're pretty freaking sweet, man.
[39:43.600 --> 39:44.720]  I'm excited about them.
[39:44.720 --> 39:44.960]  Yeah.
[39:44.960 --> 39:46.400]  I'm gonna, I'll be up there really soon.
[39:46.400 --> 39:47.360]  I want to go get some stuff.
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.080]  Oh man, you sparked so many questions.
[39:50.080 --> 39:50.800]  So many questions.
[39:50.800 --> 39:51.760]  I'm not sure which one to pick.
[39:51.760 --> 39:54.080]  I have, I'll choose one from a listener.
[39:54.080 --> 39:55.360]  I got to grab my phone again.
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.000]  I feel like I'm the wrong person in this damn chair.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.760]  I feel like if Jesse was here right now, he would have been all in this conversation.
[40:01.760 --> 40:04.000]  And I'm just sitting over here like with my mouth open.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.880]  And like, oh, so that's great, man.
[40:07.760 --> 40:13.280]  I love hearing about this because I see it around in all the growing
[40:13.280 --> 40:14.400]  footage and shit.
[40:14.400 --> 40:18.880]  Part of my show is to bring the growers on your level and the growers on his level
[40:18.880 --> 40:21.440]  into one together because we're not different.
[40:21.440 --> 40:22.720]  I started first.
[40:22.720 --> 40:27.600]  You were playing guitar or being a skateboarder or you probably play Xbox way better than me.
[40:27.600 --> 40:28.880]  You might MMA fight.
[40:28.880 --> 40:30.400]  I was growing weed while you were doing that.
[40:30.400 --> 40:31.520]  I'll help you grow some weed.
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.040]  Hopefully when I want to learn how to MMA fight or some shit, you're down to teach me.
[40:35.040 --> 40:35.840]  I live back East.
[40:35.840 --> 40:37.920]  There was nobody that was willing to teach you.
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.720]  And you know, it's, I watched all the YouTube videos for many, many years.
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.240]  So now being able to see it firsthand and being able to have different styles.
[40:48.240 --> 40:48.880]  Yeah.
[40:48.880 --> 40:51.520]  When I let you trim the first time, I thought you had a boner.
[40:51.520 --> 40:52.640]  It was kind of weird.
[40:52.640 --> 40:54.560]  Yeah, I did until the dog.
[40:54.560 --> 40:57.280]  And then it was like, it got really weird.
[40:58.240 --> 40:58.800]  Yeah.
[40:58.800 --> 40:59.120]  Yeah.
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.960]  When I gave him that grateful dog, he went nuts.
[41:01.840 --> 41:03.200]  It was stunk so good.
[41:03.200 --> 41:03.440]  Wow.
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.080]  What happened?
[41:04.080 --> 41:05.200]  Oh, I know what's happening.
[41:05.200 --> 41:09.120]  I hope that doesn't really affect the podcast here because I'm getting a phone call and
[41:09.120 --> 41:11.360]  it's popping up on my computer because the new iOS.
[41:11.360 --> 41:11.600]  Nope.
[41:11.600 --> 41:12.080]  It's working.
[41:12.080 --> 41:13.520]  The new iOS eight likes to do that.
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.400]  But anyway, let's get back on track here.
[41:16.400 --> 41:18.960]  No, dude, I like having you on because you don't have to be a pro to be here.
[41:18.960 --> 41:23.440]  You, you might ask the one question that the listeners are wondering because we're Sean
[41:23.440 --> 41:26.880]  and I kind of know what we're saying and we just, we get, I've been told that we're snobs
[41:26.880 --> 41:30.880]  and we just talk right over some points because we expect everyone to know it happens.
[41:30.880 --> 41:33.360]  I mean, that wears off really well too.
[41:33.360 --> 41:37.440]  Like it's, it's, it's just, I go home and she'll have like, oh, this, so, so-and-so
[41:37.440 --> 41:39.520]  gave us some bud and I'm like, I don't, I don't want that.
[41:39.520 --> 41:39.840]  Yeah.
[41:39.840 --> 41:40.320]  I'm good.
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.840]  Now that you've seen some things.
[41:42.240 --> 41:45.600]  We've kind of opened Adam's eyes when Adam first moved here, he would have smoked anything.
[41:46.240 --> 41:47.600]  I have smoked anything.
[41:48.960 --> 41:49.520]  Yeah.
[41:49.520 --> 41:53.520]  You know, that guy that cleans out your ashtray and smokes the stuff out of your ashtray.
[41:53.520 --> 41:54.640]  That'd totally be Adam.
[41:54.640 --> 41:55.360]  Adam will do that.
[41:56.320 --> 41:56.800]  Yep.
[41:56.800 --> 41:57.360]  All right.
[41:57.360 --> 41:58.800]  So we got an email though.
[41:59.680 --> 42:03.440]  Actually, this is a Facebook comment from our good buddy, Fred, Fred Garvin.
[42:03.440 --> 42:05.360]  Fred likes to comment and I appreciate it, dude.
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.120]  So this one says, ha ha, shout out Jeff.
[42:07.120 --> 42:09.520]  Hey, episode 44 was rocking dude.
[42:09.520 --> 42:12.480]  I caught that tease about the next episode and map and DAP.
[42:12.480 --> 42:13.600]  I'm really interested in that.
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.800]  I know nothing about it except Cushman yammering on about it being bad on a couple other podcasts,
[42:18.800 --> 42:19.760]  but that's it.
[42:19.760 --> 42:21.360]  So I would like to know what it is.
[42:21.360 --> 42:22.080]  Is it bad?
[42:22.080 --> 42:24.400]  Is it in my Canada A and B cocoa?
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.680]  And if it is bad, what synthetic new line should I, should I slash we be looking at anyway,
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.680]  keep the shows coming and stay frosty, bro.
[42:31.680 --> 42:32.800]  And thanks for what you do.
[42:33.440 --> 42:37.120]  So first of all, I want to say, dude, thanks for freaking sending us messages,
[42:37.200 --> 42:39.680]  participating and thank, and thanking us for what we do.
[42:39.680 --> 42:41.040]  Like I said earlier, that means a lot.
[42:41.040 --> 42:41.680]  Yeah, that was awesome.
[42:41.680 --> 42:42.640]  That was a really weird echo.
[42:42.640 --> 42:43.360]  Would you catch that?
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.120]  Something went digital on me.
[42:45.120 --> 42:45.520]  That's cool.
[42:45.520 --> 42:46.080]  It's back though.
[42:46.080 --> 42:46.320]  Yeah.
[42:46.320 --> 42:47.040]  Thanks for the question.
[42:47.040 --> 42:48.560]  And so that's a question for Sean.
[42:48.560 --> 42:49.520]  You were talking about mapping.
[42:49.520 --> 42:49.760]  Yeah.
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.320]  So mapping DAP is, let's see if I can say this right.
[42:52.320 --> 42:59.120]  It's mono ammonium phosphate and diopotassium phosphate or something similar to that.
[42:59.120 --> 42:59.840]  I'll give it to you.
[42:59.840 --> 43:00.480]  Yeah.
[43:00.480 --> 43:11.040]  But basically they're, they're chemicals that are used in basically every single hydro product
[43:11.040 --> 43:13.280]  or synthetic nutrient product on the shelf.
[43:14.400 --> 43:16.720]  They're synthetic salts.
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.680]  The big problem with them in my opinion is they don't flush out of plants.
[43:23.680 --> 43:26.480]  I, you know, I don't think that you can get them out.
[43:27.120 --> 43:29.920]  Heavy metals and things like that are stored in the trichome.
[43:30.480 --> 43:34.720]  So once you kind of get them in there, there's no way to get them out.
[43:34.720 --> 43:38.480]  And if you're blasting, you're blasting those heavy metals into your mix.
[43:38.480 --> 43:39.040]  Exactly.
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.040]  And that's, you know, I kind of mentioned azomite a couple of times and azomite is
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.360]  one of the things that's filled with heavy metals.
[43:45.360 --> 43:48.720]  So you really want to be, you know, you don't want to use too much of that stuff.
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.920]  Glacial rock dust filled with heavy metals.
[43:51.920 --> 43:57.520]  So it's not just, or synthetics, you know, that are filled with these things,
[43:57.520 --> 44:03.440]  but mono, map and DAP are probably the worst of all, just in the simple fact that they're
[44:03.440 --> 44:05.440]  the most common and it's easy.
[44:05.440 --> 44:07.280]  It's something easy to look out for.
[44:07.280 --> 44:12.400]  And I'm not telling you to like run away from the map and DAP, but it's, if you're somebody
[44:12.400 --> 44:19.120]  who's interested in a cleaner product, something that's a little bit more organic, you know,
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.400]  you need to become familiar with the terms that you need to look out for.
[44:22.400 --> 44:24.080]  And those are some of them.
[44:24.240 --> 44:30.240]  If you're looking for a nice organic product, look for something with like a soybean meal
[44:30.240 --> 44:33.040]  or kelp or alfalfa or brewer's yeast.
[44:33.040 --> 44:35.120]  Oh, Sol Synthetics offers stuff like that.
[44:35.120 --> 44:35.360]  Yeah.
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.040]  Sol Synthetics is a killer line.
[44:37.040 --> 44:38.000]  And it smells so good.
[44:38.000 --> 44:38.320]  Yeah.
[44:38.320 --> 44:43.040]  BioBiz is, especially if he's running Canna, I mean, if you're running Canna, then, you know,
[44:43.040 --> 44:45.600]  BioBiz is an organic nutrient line.
[44:45.600 --> 44:53.200]  That's very similar style of growing, really high quality stuff or grown on Instagram.
[44:53.280 --> 44:55.920]  I don't know if everybody probably follows that guy.
[44:55.920 --> 44:57.680]  He straight crushes it.
[44:58.240 --> 44:59.040]  All BioBiz.
[44:59.600 --> 45:01.680]  I don't know if he really talks about what he uses.
[45:01.680 --> 45:01.920]  Yeah.
[45:01.920 --> 45:04.320]  But a lot of us don't talk about it on the Instagram feed.
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.920]  I'm going to call him out because he's got amazing shit and he's using organics and he
[45:07.920 --> 45:09.440]  deserves to be called out on it.
[45:09.440 --> 45:09.680]  That's cool.
[45:09.680 --> 45:11.520]  You're using organics and getting good progress.
[45:11.520 --> 45:13.040]  That's, you deserve to be noted.
[45:13.040 --> 45:14.400]  Congratulations on that one.
[45:14.400 --> 45:17.680]  But yeah, the BioBiz is a really good one to use.
[45:18.880 --> 45:20.240]  General Organics.
[45:21.120 --> 45:26.080]  That's another one to use that's really good, but, you know, to each his own.
[45:26.080 --> 45:28.720]  I don't use things like that.
[45:28.720 --> 45:31.360]  There's, what's the big one on the market right now?
[45:31.360 --> 45:31.920]  Moab.
[45:31.920 --> 45:32.560]  Yeah.
[45:32.560 --> 45:32.800]  You know.
[45:32.800 --> 45:33.680]  The mother of all blooms.
[45:33.680 --> 45:34.160]  Yeah.
[45:34.160 --> 45:37.200]  You know what Moab is, is just map.
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.920]  If you look in the ingredients, it's like 99.9% map.
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.600]  So I'm not going to sit here and tell you that it's like going to kill you or it's bad for you,
[45:46.240 --> 45:49.760]  but it's one of the things you want to look out for if you're an organic grower.
[45:49.840 --> 45:52.880]  So it's just printed on the bottle as mono ammonium phosphate.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.200]  Yes.
[45:53.200 --> 45:53.520]  Okay.
[45:53.520 --> 45:56.880]  So if you're looking for it, that's map and DAP is the dio-
[45:56.880 --> 45:58.160]  Ammonium phosphate.
[45:58.160 --> 45:58.960]  It's very similar.
[45:58.960 --> 45:59.600]  Yeah.
[45:59.600 --> 46:02.880]  So if you're trying to avoid that, that those are the two to stray from.
[46:03.520 --> 46:09.040]  And I know I'm just parroting what Cushman says, but Cushman says that that's often what
[46:09.040 --> 46:11.840]  gives you, when you smoke good weed and for some reason you get a headache and you're like,
[46:11.840 --> 46:12.640]  but that was good herb.
[46:12.640 --> 46:13.680]  Why did it give me a headache?
[46:13.680 --> 46:15.920]  It had map and DAP residuals in it.
[46:16.480 --> 46:20.560]  I can't prove that, but that's what Cushman has led me to believe from everything he has said.
[46:20.560 --> 46:22.560]  And I mostly trust Cushman.
[46:22.560 --> 46:24.800]  There's no reason not to trust Cushman in my opinion.
[46:24.800 --> 46:25.760]  He smokes a lot.
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.240]  No, he's the, he's kicking ass and taking names with his veganics right now.
[46:30.240 --> 46:31.360]  He's won a couple of cups.
[46:33.760 --> 46:35.440]  He really knows what the plant wants.
[46:35.440 --> 46:35.680]  Yeah.
[46:35.680 --> 46:36.880]  I'll take his word for it.
[46:36.880 --> 46:37.120]  Yeah.
[46:38.080 --> 46:39.520]  Do you recycle your soil?
[46:39.520 --> 46:39.760]  Yes.
[46:39.760 --> 46:41.520]  Did I ask you that on the last episode?
[46:41.520 --> 46:41.920]  Yeah.
[46:41.920 --> 46:44.240]  I don't, I don't like to recycle my soil.
[46:44.240 --> 46:44.560]  Okay.
[46:44.560 --> 46:45.200]  I really don't.
[46:45.280 --> 46:47.440]  I do it because it's cheap.
[46:48.960 --> 46:49.760]  I really don't.
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.360]  If I recycle my soil, I like to use it as a, in my veggie garden, but I just, I haven't
[46:55.360 --> 46:56.560]  mastered that yet.
[46:56.560 --> 46:56.880]  Okay.
[46:56.880 --> 47:01.120]  Um, I always see a loss in yield no matter what I do.
[47:01.120 --> 47:04.160]  I've blamed it on other things and haven't attributed it to that.
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.840]  I'm thinking that these worm castings are going to help me out, fix that problem.
[47:07.840 --> 47:08.080]  Yeah.
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.120]  And I'm having better luck, uh, starting with sterile medias.
[47:13.120 --> 47:16.240]  You know, I used to run like happy frog and roots and stuff like that.
[47:16.800 --> 47:19.760]  Uh, switched it up to more of like a pro mix base.
[47:20.800 --> 47:22.240]  Got a lot better results out of that.
[47:22.240 --> 47:27.760]  Now I'm running my own like vermicompost, peat moss and buckwheat hole with amendments
[47:27.760 --> 47:33.600]  and stuff, but the pro mix and stuff, I'm getting better results with reusing the soil.
[47:33.600 --> 47:35.600]  It's a lot easier to amend it at the beginning.
[47:35.600 --> 47:36.880]  It being a sterile media.
[47:36.880 --> 47:37.200]  Okay.
[47:37.200 --> 47:41.040]  Um, I can write down how much of what I put into it.
[47:41.040 --> 47:45.280]  And basically if my plant doesn't show a deficiency throughout that cycle, I just
[47:45.280 --> 47:52.480]  remand everything like I would, you know, a brand new soil mix and grow right back into it.
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.320]  Whereas, you know, running the Fox farm and the roots organic, I feel like with the
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.160]  guanos and the blood meals and everything that's already in there, plus me amending it
[48:02.720 --> 48:07.680]  by the end of the cycle, sure the might not have been of any deficiencies, but I really don't know
[48:08.320 --> 48:09.440]  where that soil's at.
[48:09.440 --> 48:09.840]  Yeah.
[48:09.840 --> 48:10.160]  Yeah.
[48:10.160 --> 48:10.400]  Okay.
[48:10.640 --> 48:13.360]  That's kind of where I'm at with reusing soil.
[48:15.600 --> 48:16.720]  Using mix.
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.160]  So this is kind of what I found to do with, I've been doing with my soil lately.
[48:20.160 --> 48:23.360]  So I take it and mix it with this stuff out of my Bokashi bucket.
[48:24.480 --> 48:29.920]  Like all of the slimy leftover pickled trash that ends up in your Bokashi bucket.
[48:29.920 --> 48:32.000]  So I just mix it in with my soil and it's kind of...
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.120]  It looks like you're making him hungry.
[48:33.120 --> 48:35.200]  I do that shit.
[48:35.200 --> 48:36.080]  I'm not doing that.
[48:36.080 --> 48:37.040]  I'm not doing that.
[48:37.200 --> 48:42.560]  So you just dump it out into your, into like a Rubbermaid container and fill it up with dirt
[48:42.560 --> 48:44.240]  and then just let it sit.
[48:44.240 --> 48:49.200]  And then basically in a couple of weeks or a month or two, or whenever I get around to
[48:49.200 --> 48:52.400]  going back to those buckets, it'll be compost.
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.440]  And then I'll mix that with worm castings and use that as a vermicompost for my soil.
[48:58.240 --> 48:58.720]  So I just...
[48:58.720 --> 49:00.320]  You use it up a lot of space, aren't you?
[49:01.360 --> 49:02.000]  Not really.
[49:02.000 --> 49:02.400]  No?
[49:02.400 --> 49:03.760]  I just picture a lot of space when I'm thinking about this.
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.800]  I have a garage.
[49:04.800 --> 49:05.040]  Okay.
[49:05.360 --> 49:07.760]  I have a garage and I don't park my car in it.
[49:09.040 --> 49:10.400]  That's what I'm storing everything.
[49:11.120 --> 49:12.320]  I do crazy shit.
[49:12.320 --> 49:13.840]  So other people have to...
[49:13.840 --> 49:17.520]  If you've had any like weird experiments you want to try and you don't have the space,
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.080]  just email Jeff and he'll let me know.
[49:20.080 --> 49:20.800]  Yeah, there we go.
[49:20.800 --> 49:24.160]  And I also have a friend in California who wants your bugs.
[49:24.160 --> 49:24.720]  Yeah.
[49:24.720 --> 49:24.880]  Yeah.
[49:24.880 --> 49:28.800]  If you've got a plant with bugs, he wants you to clip off a leaf of that or a branch of that
[49:28.800 --> 49:30.880]  plant and send it to him so that he can play with the bugs.
[49:30.880 --> 49:31.920]  That's his specialty.
[49:31.920 --> 49:32.560]  That's cool.
[49:32.560 --> 49:32.800]  Yeah.
[49:32.800 --> 49:33.600]  Tree Town, what's up, bro?
[49:33.600 --> 49:34.240]  I hope you're listening.
[49:35.120 --> 49:39.520]  Yeah, I met a guy at the cup who does something similar with microscopes.
[49:39.520 --> 49:43.680]  He's been through a couple of Elaine Ingram courses and he's like,
[49:43.680 --> 49:46.080]  yeah, send me your soil, send me your tea.
[49:46.080 --> 49:47.360]  We'll get them looked at.
[49:48.000 --> 49:48.240]  Yeah.
[49:48.240 --> 49:49.360]  Some people are hardcore, man.
[49:49.360 --> 49:50.480]  You got to find your niche.
[49:50.480 --> 49:51.040]  Yeah.
[49:51.040 --> 49:51.360]  Yeah.
[49:51.360 --> 49:52.000]  That's the truth.
[49:52.560 --> 49:54.800]  Adam's a good little transplanter and grunt worker.
[49:54.800 --> 49:56.000]  He does some shit in the gardens.
[49:56.640 --> 49:57.760]  I just work to get it done.
[49:57.760 --> 50:00.960]  I walked in the room and him and this other dude had dirt flying three feet in the air
[50:00.960 --> 50:02.400]  and all of it was landing into pots.
[50:02.400 --> 50:03.520]  I don't know how it was working.
[50:04.240 --> 50:06.640]  I don't know if Mike knew what to think about that.
[50:06.640 --> 50:07.360]  No, that's right.
[50:07.360 --> 50:10.080]  No, you definitely work at a different pace than what Mike's doing.
[50:10.080 --> 50:10.800]  That's fine.
[50:10.800 --> 50:11.440]  He picked up.
[50:11.440 --> 50:11.920]  He picked up.
[50:11.920 --> 50:12.400]  It was fun.
[50:12.400 --> 50:12.900]  Yeah.
[50:13.760 --> 50:15.440]  What should I not use in my organics?
[50:15.440 --> 50:16.880]  That's going to be my last question for the day.
[50:17.920 --> 50:22.880]  It depends on your level of your dedication to organics,
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.800]  but the first thing that I would kick out would be blood meal and bone meal.
[50:26.800 --> 50:27.040]  Okay.
[50:27.920 --> 50:33.120]  If you really care about organics, chances are you don't eat GMOs
[50:33.120 --> 50:38.320]  and you don't eat, I'm not going to say you're a vegetarian if you're into organics and stuff,
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.440]  but those things are byproducts of the slaughterhouse industry.
[50:43.440 --> 50:45.840]  Feather meal is a byproduct of the poultry industry.
[50:48.080 --> 50:49.200]  They have their place.
[50:49.200 --> 50:54.480]  Don't get me wrong because I'd rather them be recycled into agricultural byproducts for farm
[50:54.480 --> 50:58.640]  and other agricultural uses, but when it comes to growing medicine for people,
[50:58.640 --> 51:04.320]  I don't believe that feather meal made from chickens that were fed antibiotics and hormones
[51:04.320 --> 51:05.680]  should be used to grow it.
[51:05.680 --> 51:09.440]  Same thing with the blood that scraped off the slaughterhouse floor to make the blood meal.
[51:09.440 --> 51:14.000]  It's just this gelatinous goo filled with everything that was in that cow.
[51:14.560 --> 51:15.920]  Bone meal, same gig.
[51:15.920 --> 51:19.680]  So if you're going to use things like that, I would just recommend there's other alternatives.
[51:19.680 --> 51:23.440]  You can use things like fish blood meal, alfalfa, kelp.
[51:23.440 --> 51:25.360]  I mean, there's a lot of plant baits.
[51:25.360 --> 51:30.240]  If you really want to get into it, comfrey and burdock root and nettle and dandelions and
[51:31.040 --> 51:33.280]  go out in the woods and pick a bunch of shit.
[51:33.280 --> 51:35.840]  Chris Bounds Am I going to come back from the Rocky
[51:35.840 --> 51:40.240]  Mountain Worm Company with a whole backseat full of brand new shit and rethink my whole
[51:40.240 --> 51:41.760]  growing method the first time I go in here?
[51:41.760 --> 51:42.560]  Chris Kroft You probably will.
[51:42.560 --> 51:45.840]  And the cool thing is, is you're going to, you'll probably see a couple of things that
[51:45.840 --> 51:47.760]  you've seen at Jesse's shop too.
[51:47.760 --> 51:50.560]  And when you see those, you know, might click with you.
[51:50.560 --> 51:52.720]  Like, well, maybe I should pick those up next time.
[51:53.520 --> 51:57.280]  You know, shout out to, if you're going to be going up to Jay's, check out the C-Crop.
[51:58.080 --> 52:01.280]  That's a little secret product that I use in my garden.
[52:01.280 --> 52:03.360]  I was gifted by Jay a long time ago.
[52:03.360 --> 52:04.560]  Chris Bounds I think you're the second one to tell me
[52:04.560 --> 52:05.040]  about that.
[52:05.040 --> 52:06.080]  Chris Kroft Shit is awesome.
[52:06.080 --> 52:07.280]  Yeah, it really is.
[52:07.280 --> 52:08.640]  Chris Bounds I think our buddy Spence had some of that.
[52:08.640 --> 52:09.440]  Chris Kroft Does he really?
[52:09.440 --> 52:13.920]  He might've picked it or Jay might've given him some of it or I don't know, but I use
[52:13.920 --> 52:16.640]  it to basically replace my full power.
[52:16.640 --> 52:22.160]  Or if you're, if anybody out there is familiar with full power or fulvic acid or humic acid,
[52:22.240 --> 52:22.960]  I use it.
[52:22.960 --> 52:23.200]  Yeah.
[52:23.200 --> 52:24.400]  And replace in place of that.
[52:24.400 --> 52:25.040]  Okay.
[52:25.040 --> 52:26.240]  Other scientific studies.
[52:26.240 --> 52:27.520]  I hope you'll be there when I go.
[52:27.520 --> 52:27.840]  Chris Kroft Yeah.
[52:27.840 --> 52:28.400]  The fun go.
[52:28.400 --> 52:28.640]  Oh yeah.
[52:28.640 --> 52:29.280]  Just give me a call.
[52:29.280 --> 52:29.840]  I'll be up there.
[52:29.840 --> 52:30.560]  I'll meet you.
[52:30.560 --> 52:31.120]  Chris Bounds Cool.
[52:31.120 --> 52:31.440]  Chris Kroft Yeah.
[52:31.440 --> 52:34.480]  I'm not sure what I'm going yet, but you know, I'm always looking for an excuse to get up.
[52:34.480 --> 52:36.320]  I'm going to go find one more gift for the girlfriend.
[52:36.320 --> 52:39.360]  So I got to sneak away while she's at work and sneak up there and get some worm castings.
[52:39.360 --> 52:40.560]  One more gift for her.
[52:40.560 --> 52:42.560]  Chris Bounds Speaking of gifts, if you guys want to get
[52:42.560 --> 52:47.600]  a cool gift for somebody, come and get that like a Bukashi bucket, a worm, you know, home
[52:47.600 --> 52:48.160]  worm farm.
[52:48.320 --> 52:49.200]  Guys, I need one of those.
[52:49.200 --> 52:50.640]  Can I ship it to Australia?
[52:50.640 --> 52:54.640]  Chris Kroft Hope your grower be more self-sufficient.
[52:54.640 --> 52:56.480]  Come by Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[52:56.480 --> 52:56.880]  Yeah.
[52:56.880 --> 52:57.360]  Yeah.
[52:57.360 --> 52:59.440]  Chris Bounds Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[52:59.440 --> 53:01.520]  They listened to the podcast because they said they liked it.
[53:01.520 --> 53:05.600]  Hey guys, I'm going to come get some worm castings and we should talk about some sponsorship
[53:05.600 --> 53:10.800]  sort of stuff because people seem to be responding to you and I want to support semi-local shit.
[53:10.800 --> 53:11.520]  You're Colorado.
[53:11.520 --> 53:12.480]  You're Colorado Springs.
[53:12.480 --> 53:14.080]  That's not Pueblo, but I still love it.
[53:14.080 --> 53:14.880]  I'd like to support that.
[53:14.880 --> 53:15.840]  Let's see if we can do something.
[53:16.560 --> 53:20.000]  I'll brag about worm castings and you supply me with worm castings.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.160]  Chris Kroft I think they might be more than happy to
[53:22.160 --> 53:22.960]  work with you, man.
[53:22.960 --> 53:24.240]  They're big fans.
[53:24.240 --> 53:24.720]  They love the show.
[53:24.720 --> 53:25.040]  Chris Bounds Cool.
[53:25.040 --> 53:25.760]  I appreciate that.
[53:25.760 --> 53:26.720]  Well, they're doing a great thing.
[53:26.720 --> 53:28.320]  I'm excited to get in there and learn about it.
[53:29.520 --> 53:31.440]  We've got 53 minutes.
[53:31.440 --> 53:33.200]  Let's start closing up the show, dude.
[53:33.200 --> 53:34.640]  I'm going to have you back on more.
[53:34.640 --> 53:37.600]  I like what you, we get sidetracked because we're potheads, but I like having you on and
[53:37.600 --> 53:39.680]  you have a lot of useful shit to share with us.
[53:39.680 --> 53:41.040]  Chris Kroft Yeah.
[53:41.760 --> 53:47.200]  Send anybody who has any questions, send them to Jeff and get them to send them to me.
[53:47.200 --> 53:53.520]  We'll have them ready next time and we'll just slam through them, but I'm fucking high.
[53:53.520 --> 53:54.320]  Chris Bounds Yeah.
[53:54.320 --> 53:55.520]  We took solventless dabs.
[53:55.520 --> 53:56.800]  We took the live resin dabs.
[53:56.800 --> 53:58.080]  We took shatter dabs.
[53:58.880 --> 54:00.320]  Adam looks dabbed.
[54:00.320 --> 54:00.720]  Adam Smith Yeah.
[54:00.720 --> 54:02.400]  I feel like I'm just tired as fuck, man.
[54:02.400 --> 54:05.040]  Chris Bounds This delicious yerba mate is keeping me up.
[54:05.040 --> 54:05.520]  Thank you, Jeff.
[54:05.520 --> 54:06.080]  Chris Bounds Yeah.
[54:06.080 --> 54:08.320]  Shout out to the mate factor.
[54:08.320 --> 54:12.240]  Also, big shout out to sweet Angela for getting me addicted to the yerba mate.
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.440]  I love you, babe, but Jesus, mate, I don't know what you've done to me.
[54:15.440 --> 54:16.560]  You've created a monster.
[54:19.360 --> 54:20.480]  Mate is so great.
[54:20.480 --> 54:23.760]  The best idea we had though was buying bags to bring it home and make it so now we don't
[54:23.760 --> 54:27.760]  have to drive to our favorite mate spot in Colorado or in Manitou Springs every time
[54:27.760 --> 54:29.440]  we want mate because we would do so.
[54:29.440 --> 54:31.440]  Adam Smith Yeah, but it's a great excuse to get up there.
[54:31.440 --> 54:32.880]  The place is freaking awesome.
[54:32.880 --> 54:34.320]  Chris Bounds I hate to say it.
[54:34.320 --> 54:37.520]  I'm more comfortable in Manitou Springs than I am here in Pueblo.
[54:37.760 --> 54:38.880]  Adam Smith It's starting to get bad here, man.
[54:38.880 --> 54:39.840]  Chris Bounds It is kind of.
[54:39.840 --> 54:44.240]  Yeah, it's a little gangster here, but I feel like I have more friends that are more open
[54:44.240 --> 54:45.680]  to go do shit in Manitou.
[54:45.680 --> 54:48.800]  Nobody wants to go out of their house here because it's weird here.
[54:48.800 --> 54:50.480]  There's nothing to really go have fun at.
[54:50.480 --> 54:52.560]  You can't go walk in Manitou.
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.160]  You can just go walk and enjoy the day.
[54:55.040 --> 54:56.240]  Shout out to Manitou Springs.
[54:56.240 --> 54:57.200]  Adam Smith It's a fun time.
[54:57.200 --> 54:57.920]  Chris Bounds Yeah, it is.
[54:59.200 --> 55:00.160]  Anybody got any shout outs?
[55:00.160 --> 55:01.680]  Anybody you want to say you love to?
[55:01.680 --> 55:03.760]  You love anybody, anything like that, you guys?
[55:03.760 --> 55:05.040]  Adam Smith It's the boy's birthday.
[55:05.040 --> 55:06.320]  Chris Bounds It's the boy's birthday.
[55:06.320 --> 55:08.320]  Happy birthday, little miniature Adam.
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.000]  I've seen pictures of him on Facebook riding his skateboard and shit, bro.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.440]  He's going to be just like you when he grows up.
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.440]  Adam Smith Yeah, I want to give a shout out to my girl Kelly for holding it down while
[55:17.440 --> 55:18.480]  I was in California.
[55:18.480 --> 55:23.200]  She took care of the growth, kept the plants healthy, and I know she was pissed that I
[55:23.200 --> 55:23.680]  left.
[55:23.680 --> 55:24.800]  So I love you, baby.
[55:24.800 --> 55:25.440]  Sorry about that.
[55:25.440 --> 55:29.040]  Chris Bounds I'm constantly trying to talk my wife into just learning that, like the
[55:29.040 --> 55:30.560]  ability to take care of something.
[55:30.560 --> 55:33.520]  If you walk in there and go, why is everything all droopy?
[55:34.400 --> 55:37.520]  They take in a lot more than they let on.
[55:37.520 --> 55:42.480]  Like I never thought that my girl could do it, but given the chance, she could probably
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.920]  make a tea better than most.
[55:43.920 --> 55:44.880]  Adam Smith What's up, Queen Cola?
[55:44.880 --> 55:46.160]  It's been a long time since I've seen you.
[55:46.160 --> 55:46.800]  Hope you're doing well.
[55:46.800 --> 55:48.640]  We used to take dabs together over at Maddie's.
[55:48.640 --> 55:49.200]  That was fun.
[55:49.200 --> 55:49.840]  Hope you're all right.
[55:49.840 --> 55:50.400]  Hope you're doing well.
[55:50.400 --> 55:51.120]  Hope you're smiling.
[55:51.120 --> 55:52.560]  Good job on holding down the plants.
[55:53.200 --> 55:55.360]  I got to give a shout out to my chick if we're talking about that.
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.200]  My chick knows her way around the garden, bro.
[55:57.840 --> 56:00.480]  If I need anything done, she can definitely do it.
[56:00.480 --> 56:01.600]  Oh, here goes my phone again.
[56:01.600 --> 56:02.480]  Dude, I just mentioned her.
[56:02.560 --> 56:03.280]  She started calling.
[56:04.640 --> 56:04.960]  Yeah.
[56:05.760 --> 56:07.680]  All right, Adam, you shouted out the boy.
[56:07.680 --> 56:08.400]  Anybody else?
[56:08.400 --> 56:10.160]  Uh, just bender, man.
[56:10.160 --> 56:10.960]  Running the servers.
[56:10.960 --> 56:12.080]  Yeah, running the servers.
[56:12.080 --> 56:12.800]  Jesse.
[56:12.800 --> 56:13.360]  Jesse.
[56:13.360 --> 56:14.000]  Yeah, dude.
[56:14.000 --> 56:15.600]  Just paid my bills, brother.
[56:15.600 --> 56:17.040]  Like, but you know, we work too.
[56:17.040 --> 56:20.720]  So, you know, I'm there busting my butt, but it's just, yeah.
[56:21.680 --> 56:22.080]  Thank you.
[56:23.520 --> 56:23.840]  Wow.
[56:23.840 --> 56:24.480]  Phone ringing.
[56:25.200 --> 56:25.680]  Oh, nice.
[56:25.680 --> 56:26.560]  Got off work early.
[56:26.560 --> 56:27.760]  We might have some food.
[56:27.760 --> 56:28.000]  Cool.

[57:17.840 --> 57:18.800]  I'll advertise.
[57:18.800 --> 57:19.600]  We won't go away.
[57:19.600 --> 57:20.800]  It'll just be a different title.
[57:21.760 --> 57:25.600]  We do need a theme song and a new logo if anybody started working on that one.

[57:31.760 --> 57:33.840]  There'll be some, at least, stickers.
[57:33.840 --> 57:35.760]  Jesse mentioned some things from the Hydro Shop.
[57:36.560 --> 57:39.680]  There'll be an iRegenetics t-shirt in there, maybe a hat pin.
[57:39.680 --> 57:41.360]  We'll see what we've got available.
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.880]  Maybe some Jenny Kush prizes that I've had around for a while that nobody claimed back
[57:44.880 --> 57:45.360]  in the day.
[57:45.360 --> 57:47.680]  I've got a Jenny Kush pin that needs a home.
[57:47.680 --> 57:48.960]  Anyway, guys, keep listening to the show.
[57:48.960 --> 57:50.160]  I really appreciate you for hanging out.
[57:50.160 --> 57:51.280]  Big shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[57:51.280 --> 57:52.880]  He taught me how to make hash today.
[57:52.880 --> 57:54.320]  You teach a man to fish, bro.
[57:55.520 --> 57:56.240]  Yeah.
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.120]  It's on now.
[57:57.120 --> 57:57.600]  Game on.
[57:57.600 --> 57:59.360]  Big shout out to you guys for coming out.
[57:59.360 --> 58:00.800]  These guys will be back on the show.
[58:00.800 --> 58:01.040]  Yeah.
[58:01.040 --> 58:01.840]  Thanks for having me.
[58:01.840 --> 58:02.880]  Thanks again for listening to you guys.
[58:02.880 --> 58:05.040]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[58:05.040 --> 58:06.080]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[58:33.000 --> 58:33.320]  Yeah.
[58:33.320 --> 58:34.120]  What's up, everybody?
[58:34.120 --> 58:37.560]  It's time for another episode of the I Grow Culture podcast, your source for cannabis
[58:37.560 --> 58:39.960]  news, education, and conversation.
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.720]  Welcome to episode number 46.
[58:41.880 --> 58:42.920]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[58:42.920 --> 58:45.480]  And I'm coming to you this week with a solo episode.
[58:45.480 --> 58:48.360]  It's the day after Christmas, and all my friends are hanging out with their family.
[58:48.360 --> 58:52.120]  So I put together a quick show this week, and I'll probably do a short episode next
[58:52.120 --> 58:53.240]  week also.
[58:53.240 --> 58:55.400]  I hope everybody had a wonderful holiday.
[58:55.400 --> 58:58.120]  Whichever holiday you choose to celebrate, I hope it was wonderful for you.
[58:58.840 --> 59:01.960]  I owe a huge thank you to my mom for an amazing Christmas gift.
[59:01.960 --> 59:04.120]  I cannot believe what my mom put together for me.
[59:04.760 --> 59:05.800]  Big thanks, mom.
[59:05.800 --> 59:07.880]  And also a big thanks to my queen.
[59:07.880 --> 59:08.680]  Thanks a lot, Angela.
[59:08.680 --> 59:09.640]  You made Christmas awesome.
[59:09.640 --> 59:11.400]  I'm glad you spent that with my family and I.
[59:11.400 --> 59:12.120]  You're family now.
[59:13.160 --> 59:15.960]  Also, I owe a big Christmas shout out to the Garden of Weden.
[59:15.960 --> 59:17.720]  Thanks for letting me be a part of your secret Santa.
[59:17.720 --> 59:18.280]  That was really cool.
[59:18.280 --> 59:19.160]  I felt blessed to be there.
[59:19.160 --> 59:19.960]  That was a good time.
[59:20.600 --> 59:23.400]  I think I'm still dabbed out from the dab gauntlet we did.
[59:23.400 --> 59:28.280]  And I'm wearing the socks that I scored at the secret Santa exchange right now.
[59:28.280 --> 59:30.600]  I got my Huff socks on, and my feet are nice and warm.
[59:31.160 --> 59:32.920]  And it's a cold-ass night here in Colorado.
[59:32.920 --> 59:34.520]  Holy shit, it's snowing out.
[59:34.520 --> 59:35.400]  It's windy as shit.
[59:35.400 --> 59:36.840]  So these socks came in perfectly.
[59:36.840 --> 59:37.400]  Thank you, guys.
[59:37.400 --> 59:38.840]  If you're in Colorado, I hope you're warm.
[59:39.800 --> 59:41.480]  Next week is a...
[59:41.480 --> 59:43.000]  It's New Year's Eve, actually.
[59:43.000 --> 59:47.000]  So I will be at the String Cheese Incident concerts in Broomfield, Colorado with my lady.
[59:47.000 --> 59:48.360]  We're taking a little mini vacation.
[59:48.360 --> 59:51.480]  So next week and this week will be kind of easy shows without a ton of info.
[59:51.480 --> 59:54.040]  But I do promise you guys that I'll get back to the original format
[59:54.040 --> 59:56.520]  with tons of info and great guests at the start of the year.
[59:57.160 --> 59:58.680]  The holidays got everybody in chaos.
[59:58.680 --> 59:59.400]  Everybody is...
[59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.280]  We're all growers, and we all have jobs and families.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.480]  So most of the guys just decided to hang out and not do a show with me this week,
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:05.960]  which is cool.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:06.680]  I don't blame them.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.480]  I hope you guys are having fun.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.560]  Big shout out to everybody who has been on the show,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.200]  who's taken some time out of their life to come put in an hour,
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.040]  an hour and a half with the Agro Culture Podcast.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:14.600]  It's pretty cool.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.240]  I appreciate it.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.440]  The listeners love you guys.
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.200]  So I got a few people to thank and a few things to remind you guys of.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.880]  But before we get into too much of that part, let's pay the bills.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.520]  Let's start with Nature's Green Remedies.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:30.920]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends at naturesgreenremedies.com.

[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.680]  This podcast is also brought to you by our friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.480]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.800]  Check out the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street or the Pueblo location on 618 East 4th Street
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.400]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.360]  Guys, if you go to the 4th Street location in Pueblo and there's no parking,
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.400]  take a right, right at the corner.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.280]  There's a taco place right there, and then turn into the alley kind of area.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.880]  And that first door is actually Hygro.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.000]  There's parking in the back.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.200]  Go park back there.
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:42.760]  It's a lot easier to carry your stuff out of the back also.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.360]  So check out Hygro for competitive pricing and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:49.800]  Don't forget that Hygro runs a special for the podcast listeners.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.320]  When you check out at Hygro, tell them you listened to the I Grow Culture podcast,
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.000]  and they will give you commercial pricing on your entire purchase.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:01.320]  Because they had a whole bunch of advanced nutrients stuff at the Pueblo location,
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.600]  and they're dying to get rid of it.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.120]  If you went in there and made them an offer on a bunch of advanced nutrients products,
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:07.960]  I bet Bern and Jesse would hook you up.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.280]  Tell them I listened to the I Grow Culture podcast.
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:13.080]  Jeff said to come in here and get these nutrients, and they'll give you a deal.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:17.800]  So this podcast is also brought to you by our good friends at TreeThugger.com.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.520]  TreeThugger.com, live music lifestyle magazine.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.520]  Check out TreeThugger.com for concert and festival news and reviews.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.880]  www.treethugger.com.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.640]  All right, much respect to all the sponsors for making the show possible.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.160]  Big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:35.400]  That song that just played was from the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.400]  They let me play all of their music on the show.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.640]  So every episode, I try to give them a shout out.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.160]  Mystic Roots Band, they're awesome.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.960]  They're SoCal reggae, kind of funk reggae.
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.240]  They got a lot of cool stuff going on.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.200]  They're probably going to play in your neighborhood sometime soon.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.720]  Those kids travel around.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.880]  Actually, they are in Europe right now.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.880]  The last pictures I saw, they were in Italy.
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.920]  Man, it's good to see the Mystic Roots Band in Italy.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.120]  I think they're just out having fun.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.880]  I don't know if they're playing, but all the pictures I've seen is just them on vacation.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:03.160]  And that is well deserved, guys.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.400]  I hope you guys are having a great vacation.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:07.320]  Shout out to Kat and Koot in the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:08.760]  Check them out.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:09.160]  They're great.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.000]  Let's see.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.160]  Got a bunch of comments and stuff to read.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.760]  What do I want to do first?
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.760]  Oh, I just smacked the microphone with the papers.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.400]  I'm sorry, guys.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.400]  I might have taken a bunch of dabs tonight.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.400]  So I want to remind you guys that we're going to change the name of the podcast.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.920]  The show is not going to be the iGrow Culture Podcast for much longer.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.720]  It will be called the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.480]  Like I've said before, there's an agricultural educational entity that has the moniker iGrow
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.120]  taken.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.640]  And also, I was told that iTunes doesn't appreciate people ripping off the I.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.720]  So we're just going to be respectful.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.280]  We're going to change it to Grow From Your Heart because that's what this is all about.
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.720]  I've always said, grow from your heart.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.080]  If you grow your herb, your cannabis, your medicine from your heart,
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.160]  you will produce better cannabis.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.480]  If you don't grow your cannabis from your wallet or your ego or your camera,
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.560]  I know I take a lot of pictures, but I grow dank herb because I grow from my heart.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.080]  That's why I'm able to take the dank pictures.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.360]  I'm not thinking about my wallet.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.760]  I'm not thinking about the harvest weight.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.360]  I pay attention to that stuff.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:11.000]  But when I'm in the grow room, I'm thinking about what's going to happen after I grow
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  this herb properly, after I flush it, after I chop it down, after I trim it, after I cure
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.360]  it, after I give it to my patients that smoke this cannabis.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.440]  I've got an older friend, his initials are DC.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.320]  I don't really want to call him out on the show, but he's who I think of when I think
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.440]  of medical cannabis.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.360]  He's a good friend of mine and I'm his caregiver.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.640]  When I see him consume the herb that I put my love into, I can see him get something
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.160]  inside of him feels better.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.320]  And it's not just a physical thing.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.000]  It's not just him getting high.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.680]  There's an emotional thing that happens to that guy when my medicine makes him feel better.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.520]  And that emotional thing happens back to me and it fulfills my heart.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:49.720]  So I grow from my heart.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.960]  You should grow from your heart as well.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:56.040]  And I think it'll improve your outlook on your weed.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.520]  It'll improve your cannabis overall.
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.520]  It'll improve your relationship with your patients.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.200]  It'll just make things a lot better.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:02.760]  Grow from your heart.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.720]  Quit growing from your wallet.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.840]  Quit growing from the scale.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.200]  Quit growing from your camera.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.960]  Quit growing from your ego and grow from your heart.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.960]  So the grow from your heart podcast, that's our new motto.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.760]  Grow from your heart.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.760]  Coming with a new name requires a new logo.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.880]  I can't change the name until I have a sweet ass new logo.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.400]  So if any of you artists out there would like to throw me down a grow from your heart podcast
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.680]  hosted by Rasta Jeff logo, I would appreciate it.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:28.840]  I don't have a lot of money to tell you the truth,
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.480]  but I would compensate you in some way that made you happy.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.280]  It may take time.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.400]  It may take payments.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.320]  It may take multiple gifts over time.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.040]  We will work something out because I like to pay back my community that helps me out.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.640]  And you like to help your community out.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.680]  So do me a favor.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.480]  Make me a logo.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.480]  I have this vision.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.160]  Jesse said it actually.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:47.880]  It's a seed.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.800]  Like if you've ever grown pot, when you germinate seeds,
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.440]  they crack open and the taproot comes out of there.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.920]  When that cracks open, it kind of makes the shape of a heart.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.520]  So if you could kind of make that into a heart with the little thing coming out of it,
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.440]  but then make that taproot actually turning into maybe, I don't know, you can get creative,
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.520]  but I want to see that heart coming out or just whatever with a heart in it or grow from your
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.840]  heart.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.200]  Of course, I like red, yellow, and green.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.240]  I'm a Rastafarian.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.480]  If you do that, I've never said this on a podcast.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.520]  If you're going to make a Rastafarian themed logo, the red goes on the bottom, you guys.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.480]  It's red, gold, and green.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:17.720]  Yes.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:20.040]  Red, yellow, green, but the red is on the bottom.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.480]  So it's actually green, yellow, red.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.480]  So do that properly.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:26.840]  If you're going to make me a logo because I'm a Rasta and I want it right, because it's almost
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.080]  disrespectful to put your logo with the colors upside down if you're bringing it in a Rasta way.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.040]  I'm not going to bitch about it.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.480]  I'm just saying do it the right way.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.440]  If you're a real Rasta, you'll understand why you want it the right way.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.480]  It's like if I put the American flag upside down, it would piss a lot of Americans off.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.880]  So just imagine you people getting the Rasta flag backwards.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.160]  It kind of frustrates some people.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.440]  I don't give too much of a shit about it.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.720]  I'm just letting you know that you're doing it wrong.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:47.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.360]  Also, we need a new theme song.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.720]  I've been playing the Mystic Roots band.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.560]  It sounds awesome, but wouldn't it be a lot cooler if I had a customized theme song that was like
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.400]  something about grow from your heart?
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.920]  I don't even know how it would go, but maybe some dance hall reggae or something.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.720]  Grow from your heart.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:03.720]  I don't know.
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.000]  That's your job, not mine.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.040]  If somebody's got a song for me, I got the same deal for you as I do the logo.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:08.840]  Some kind of kickdown.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.080]  If you're in Colorado, I'll hand you packs of seeds.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.440]  You'll get iRegenetic seeds.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.640]  Feminized or regular or both.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.600]  We'll work something out.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.760]  I'll give you a t-shirt.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:19.800]  I'm going to get more hoodies made.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.040]  More of the iRegenetics hoodies are being planned out.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.240]  Shout out to Handmade Apparel.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.520]  We're negotiating.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.680]  Had to kind of hesitate a little bit.
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.560]  I'm going to do it at the start of the year just for tax purposes, and then we'll get some more
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.040]  hoodies.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:31.320]  Maybe you'll get a hoodie out of the deal.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:32.760]  I'm begging.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:37.240]  I'm just asking for a new logo and a new theme song for the grow from your heart podcast because
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.240]  I'm too busy putting together shows and growing gardens and teaching people how to grow herb
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:43.560]  to actually be able to make a new logo.
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.760]  I don't really have good art skills.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.760]  So if you do that, I'd appreciate it.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:48.840]  Let's see.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:49.640]  What's the next part?
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.320]  I've been getting a ton of emails, dude.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:52.200]  Holy crap.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.120]  I'm getting so many emails, tweets, and Facebook messages about the podcast.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.040]  It's overwhelming in such a good way.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.280]  I want to thank everybody for messaging me.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.800]  The huge response I've gotten the last few episodes has really inspired me to push the
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.240]  show to the next level.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.120]  I've been putting more time into the shows and doing more research because I want to
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.480]  keep bringing the best show that I can.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.520]  Every time you guys message me, that makes me want to try a little bit harder.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:15.720]  I just want to step it up.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.320]  Let's see.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.640]  I've got a couple of tweets that I saved here.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:21.400]  I've got them in my phone.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.520]  So I got to search through the phone.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.200]  I know I just said I want to bring you guys better shows.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.440]  Does that bring you a half-ass New Year's Eve show?
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.640]  I don't have any guests or anything.
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.680]  I thought I'd have people here.
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:32.040]  So I don't have a lot planned, but I'm going to make it dope for you.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:32.520]  Let's see.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.080]  Big shout out to Party McFly.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.520]  He says, Ross to Jeff bro.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.080]  Oh, yeah, you can tweet me at the I grow culture or I grow.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.000]  It's at I grow culture, or you can also tweet me.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.280]  It's at Ross to Jeff 420.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.640]  If you just want to hit me directly.
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.720]  I check them both quite frequently, like once a day.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.760]  Probably this dude says, bro, I love the podcast.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.760]  It's the first podcast I've been into.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.160]  I'm going to have to start from the beginning and catch up.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.080]  Um, okay.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.160]  I'm embarrassed that you're going to do that because honestly,
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.000]  well, let me not say I'm embarrassed.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.200]  I guess I'm proud now.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.360]  The first, uh, 25 episodes or so, I didn't know what I was doing.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.760]  I turned on the microphone and just blurted out a bunch of shit.
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.920]  And whatever came out of my face is how the show went.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:13.400]  And then I started making too many notes and it got a little weird.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.720]  I feel like I'm kind of comfortable with the microphone now.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.440]  I just turn it on.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.440]  I start, I make a few bullet points and start going and it all comes out.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.440]  I'm not so, uh, so hypercritical of it now, but dude, uh, party McFly.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.360]  And the way you wrote your Twitter handle is pretty cool.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:31.480]  I can't even, uh, I don't know what, how you did that, but it's at frivolous,
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:33.000]  F R I V O L A S.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.120]  If you want to follow party McFly, dude, thanks for the tweet that, uh,
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.880]  I hope you listened to every single episode.
[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.960]  If you want to listen to them all, they're on iTunes.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.760]  Um, I think the last 10 are on Stitcher, but every single episode,
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.680]  all the way from the beginning, all the way up to whatever episode you're on.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.840]  We'll always be on the ireegeneticscolorado.com website.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.520]  I'm going to have to change the tab on there.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.640]  We're going to do a lot of changing.
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.920]  You guys don't get lost.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.400]  It's still going to be in the same feed.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.680]  So if you're listening on iTunes or Stitcher or whatever, the feed will still be the same.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.000]  If you're coming to the website, it'll still be easy to find.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.520]  Don't lose me when I change my name.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.120]  I just have to do it.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.560]  It's going to be super easy.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.800]  So party McFly, I'm rambling.
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.040]  I took a bunch of dabs, a lot of dabs.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:15.480]  I made these dabs even.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.160]  Uh, party McFly, thanks for messaging me on Twitter.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.480]  My next tweet came from Roadrunner.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.720]  It's at road underscore runner 420.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.720]  He said, listening from the UK, still underground here,
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.880]  but great to see you guys leading the way for us.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.520]  Great show.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.400]  Keep it up, dude.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:31.880]  Thanks a lot.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.440]  Those words of encouragement mean a lot to me.
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.400]  Like I was saying, everybody wants to hear that they're doing right.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.520]  Sometimes you just put in a bunch of work and nobody says anything and you're like,
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.240]  ah, but you guys have been making me feel like I'm killing it.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:43.720]  So awesome.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.040]  Thank you.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.800]  We've gotten 6,500 listens on some episodes.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.040]  The episode with King Cola is probably going to hit 10,000 episodes.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:57.000]  Eventually that will be the first one to do it, which is remarkable because it's a newer episode.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.320]  And there's been a lot of time on other shows and they haven't been listened to nearly as
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.920]  much as the episodes with King Cola.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.120]  So shout out to King Cola.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:08.280]  And episode 35 with Drying and Curing also has been a huge success.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.240]  If you guys haven't listened to that one, it's time.
[01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.600]  Go back and listen to number 35.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:16.520]  If I had a recommendation for you, 35 and then the ones with King Cola.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.400]  I don't remember the numbers.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.200]  I could pause and look.
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:18.520]  Hold on.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:20.760]  All right.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.960]  I went back and checked.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:28.760]  I honestly think that from 35 on is where if 35 through 45 are some of our best episodes ever.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.640]  There are a couple in there.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.240]  44 is Random Chatter because we got chatty.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.000]  And then 41 is Chatty Stoners.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.200]  But for the most part, the 35 through 45 are some of my favorite, most proud episodes.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.440]  45, more about organics with King Cola.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.000]  43, intro to organics with King Cola.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.200]  Those are some great episodes.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.040]  Number 42, intro to NPK.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.240]  That got a lot of response.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.440]  The episodes about building your grow, 39 and 40.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.280]  Those really crushed it.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.440]  37 was planning your grow space.
[01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.400]  That did a lot.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:03.960]  35, drying and curing definitely has been listened to a whole bunch.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.560]  Thanks a lot, guys, for listening to those.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.120]  It's good to know that you're paying attention and liking it.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.080]  I'm so rambly today.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.840]  I'm glad I turned on the microphone.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.640]  Guys, take a dab.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.600]  I'm going to take a dab right quick.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.800]  I've got some dabs sitting here.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.320]  This is a mix of stuff that I recently grew.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.280]  My homie Spence taught me how to make this hash.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.120]  I usually wasn't making it.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.160]  I was letting other people do it.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.600]  But why not be self-sufficient, right?
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.040]  This is a White Widow Girl Scout Cookies.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.000]  No, there's no cookies in here.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.240]  White Widow, Golden Goat, Flow, Ghost OG.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.880]  There's Gorilla Glue number four in here.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.320]  There's some Lemon Jeffrey in here.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.440]  There's Lemon Skunk.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.360]  So this is quite a nice mix.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.480]  I'm going to take a big fat dab.
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:44.680]  You guys take a dab with me, please.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.840]  I want to give a big shout out to Giddyup and Emotech.
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.960]  I'm hitting this g-nail.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.760]  I've had it turned on for about a month now.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.480]  I haven't turned it off.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:00.960]  I don't think.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.360]  Oh, that was a big dab.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:03.680]  Wow.
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.920]  And this g-nail has not given me any trouble.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:06.800]  It's been awesome.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.280]  I love it.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:10.240]  It's got a USB port on the front that'll charge up your phone.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.360]  So you can plug in.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:13.120]  If you've only got a limited spot of plugs,
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:14.960]  you can plug in your e-nail or the g-nail.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.520]  And then you can plug in your iPhone into that
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.840]  and charge your phone while you're taking hot dabs.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.560]  It's amazing.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.040]  I like it.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.280]  So shout out to Giddyup.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:23.920]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.560]  That was a good gift.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.160]  Came right before Christmas.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:27.680]  All right.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.000]  Let's see.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:28.640]  I did the tweets.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.720]  I want to thank Jake and Emily.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:31.840]  Wow, I just yelled into the microphone.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.160]  I'm sorry.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.840]  I hope the software fixes that.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.920]  I want to thank Jake and Emily for the emails they sent.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.360]  I will be in touch very soon, you guys.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.720]  I haven't responded to a bunch of emails.
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:39.520]  It's been the holidays.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.840]  I've been a little overwhelmed.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.880]  I'll get back to you, I promise.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.880]  But I'm interested.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.560]  You guys said some things and I'm interested.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.760]  I'm paying attention.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.400]  Also, I want to give a big thanks to G35.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.240]  Don't even ask, guys.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:52.800]  That's his name.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.400]  He can be G35 if he wants.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:55.920]  Brent M.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.000]  And also Fred Garvin.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.400]  I want to thank you guys for all your interaction messages,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.840]  tweets, emails, Facebooks, all of the above.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.840]  I appreciate the emails, guys.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.440]  Send them to igrowculture at hotmail.com.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.360]  Shit, I'm going to have to change that, too.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.640]  We're going to make another email address since we're changing everything.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.120]  I can just keep that and I'll forward it, but we'll make up another one.
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.280]  Episode 50 is coming up, guys.
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.120]  And I'm planning a small celebration episode.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:24.320]  I'm going to try to get as many microphones as I have.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.160]  I'm going to try to get that many people.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:31.040]  My software or my setup here, I could probably put in 20 microphones with all the inputs
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.960]  and other inlines I've got.
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.400]  I don't really, you know, we'll try to get Adam and Jesse and maybe Spence.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.760]  Hey, Maddie, you're invited.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.880]  I'd like to have Maddie on the show.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.880]  It'd be great to have the first chick on the show be you.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.400]  I'm sorry, the first woman.
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.120]  I won't say chick.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.680]  That's sexist.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.840]  We'll have the first woman on the show be Maddie.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.040]  I'm trying to correct myself there.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.080]  I'd like your guys' input about episode number 50.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.360]  I've got a few questions for you.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.160]  So if you want to email me or tweet me, now's a good time.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.920]  I want to know what were some of your favorite moments on the podcast so far?
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.960]  What stood out to you?
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.080]  If there's an episode or a moment that stood out, tweet me and tell me what it was.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080]  I want to celebrate that on episode 50.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.760]  What did you guys learn?
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.920]  Is there something that you learned that really stood out?
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.600]  Like if you ever heard somebody say one thing and you're like, oh my God,
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.280]  I've been listening to this guy ramble for a whole hour and that's the one thing that
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.240]  made it worth it.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:24.320]  If you got one thing that you learned or something that really stood out, let me know.
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:27.200]  I want to know what you guys learned from me or us.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.520]  Also, who's your favorite guest on my podcast?
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.120]  I've had a lot of people on Spence, Jesse, Mike, Adam, King Cola.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.920]  Addison DeMoro was on the show via interview.
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.440]  That was one of my most proud because that was my second episode and I called up Addison
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.640]  like I had a podcast going on.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.760]  I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.360]  It was kind of funny of me to do.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.880]  I should try that again and see how it goes.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.080]  Also, I want to know what would you guys like to hear next?
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:55.600]  I talk a lot and why not make it be about something that you guys actually want to hear,
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:59.280]  you know, because if I'm just going to talk, you can tell me what you want me to say instead
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.200]  of me just rambling and rambling and rambling.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:02.960]  All right.
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.240]  So send me some input, you guys.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.480]  It's igrowculture at hotmail.com.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.600]  You can tweet me at igrowculture or you can find me on Facebook.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:11.840]  Send me a message there.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.960]  Just search for igrowculture.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.720]  I've got a personal Facebook.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.320]  If you guys find that, I don't accept every friend request right away.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.840]  I kind of, I'll troll you a little bit and see who you are before I approve your stuff
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.920]  because I'm getting, if Facebook's getting weird, I'm sorry.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.800]  I don't want to be that open anymore.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.280]  I'm completely open with the iRegenetics stuff and the igrowculture stuff.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.240]  All of that is fair game.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:32.800]  I tweet.
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.320]  I Instagram.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.200]  Dude, my iRegenetics Instagram blows up and I'm going to brag a little bit.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.760]  My mom spoiled the shit out of me for Christmas.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.960]  She knows that I've been looking at this Nikon camera and so on Christmas, the gifts were
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.280]  all done and then she slid this other box toward me and just smiled and had a tear in
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.400]  her eye and when I opened it, I kind of got a tear in my eye also because she hooked me
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:59.840]  up with the Nikon D32, the D3200, the package with the extra lens and the bag and shit.
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.720]  And I've been eyeballing that thing for quite a while.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.440]  So thanks mom again.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:08.400]  That's why I shouted her out at the start of the show, but holy shit, dude, that's the
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.080]  one of the best gifts I've ever gotten.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:14.880]  Not to discredit any other gifts, but I mean, holy crap, that's the camera I've been eyeballing
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.400]  for months and mom's bought it for me.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.760]  So thanks again, mom.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.080]  That means that my Instagram is going to improve.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.920]  You're going to see better pictures.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.120]  You're going to see more angles.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.320]  You're going to see more zoom.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:27.600]  You're going to see better, better, better just because I've got better gear.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.360]  I've been shooting those Instagram shots.
[01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.320]  You see if you follow me on IG, those shots come from a Panasonic Lumix point and shoot
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.880]  camera that was $199 at Best Buy and that's what I'm pulling off.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.760]  So now that I've upgraded to this freaking badass camera, I think you'll see some improvement.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.960]  All right, I've been rambling about that.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.040]  Holy crap, but follow me on Instagram if you want to.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.280]  It's Igrowculture or Ireadgenetics.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:49.920]  I've got them both.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.680]  I post a lot of stuff on Ireadgenetics.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.880]  I post about every three hours I try just to keep it moving.
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.880]  Holy crap, guys, I'm dabbed out and I feel like I'm talking really, really quickly.
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.600]  Let's take a big yoga breath together and slow down a little bit.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.560]  Yeah, that's the sound of me calming down.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.680]  I do that shit sometimes.
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.520]  I need to calm down for this part.
[01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:10.880]  This is important.
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.240]  I've got a friend whose name is Deacon Gray.
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.680]  Deacon Gray is a comedian.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:21.520]  He's from Oklahoma, but he currently resides in the great city of Denver, Colorado.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.520]  If you've gone to a show at Comedy Works, there's a good chance you've seen Deacon Gray
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.560]  as an opening act.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.920]  He's a little white-haired dude that tells weed jokes.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.920]  He talks about being from Oklahoma.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.600]  He's hilarious in my opinion.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.560]  Deacon Gray has made me laugh my ass off multiple times.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.880]  Recently, I'm going to go to this website that I've got here.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.840]  I've got to search through it real quick.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.320]  Sorry, I'm stumbling because I was trying to be somber about this.
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.280]  Let's see.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.040]  I've got to back up one tab.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.400]  Deacon Gray, this page is called Help Deacon Gray Grab Cancer by the Throat.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.360]  Help Deacon Gray Grab Cancer by the Throat.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:03.840]  Deacon was living his life and slinging his jokes and doing his duties as a new talent
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:05.120]  coordinator at Comedy Works.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.120]  Everything was hunky-dory, except that his friends say hunky-dory when he noticed he
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:10.560]  had a lump on his neck.
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.600]  Better have that looked at.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.080]  Well, he had it looked at and they wanted to look at it a little closer, like take a
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.000]  tonsil out closer, which they did.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.320]  The bad news, it's cancer, you guys.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:24.720]  The good news, it's a highly curable kind of cancer, the same kind that Nuggets coach
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.480]  George Carl beat recently.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.320]  His prognosis is excellent.
[01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:33.200]  His spirits are good, but he's got several weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:33.760]  to get through.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:35.600]  So it says click more.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.720]  I'm not going to read all this to you guys.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:37.280]  You get the point.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:41.200]  What I'm headed for is Deacon Gray has made me laugh my ass off several times.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.880]  He's funny as fuck, dude.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.160]  He tells weed jokes.
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.760]  His delivery is amazing.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.280]  And in return for making me laugh, I want to shout out his website so that we can raise
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.320]  this guy a little bit of money.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.440]  He's got throat cancer.
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:54.640]  We got to get him through it.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:57.600]  He can't smoke cannabis right now because he's got throat cancer, but he can definitely
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.240]  eat edibles.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:19:59.200]  He can do stuff like that.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.360]  So if you live near Deacon Gray and you see him, lay an edible on him, a good edible.
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.320]  Don't give him some bullshit.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.080]  Give him a good, clean, quality edible.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.800]  And then after that, go to giveforward.com and search for Deacon Gray.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.440]  I'm looking for the...
[01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.360]  It just wants to show me.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:15.680]  Here we go.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.920]  It's giveforward.com slash fundraiser.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.680]  There's a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.280]  So just go to giveforward.com and search for Deacon Gray.
[01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.440]  It's D-E-A-C-O-N.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.520]  And then his last name is Gray, G-R-A-Y.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.640]  I truly appreciate it.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.960]  You can donate as little as $5.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.280]  Somebody on here donated.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.680]  One of the last donations that I saw was $1,000 and I thought that was really generous.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.640]  I wish I could give somebody $1,000 for their cancer treatment and help, but man, I will
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.000]  contribute a little bit to this.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:44.960]  I won't disclose how much.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.280]  That's my personal donation, but I will donate to this cause as soon as I'm leaving the tab
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.440]  open so that I can do it right after the show here.
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.000]  But I'd appreciate it if you guys just went through a couple bucks to Deacon Gray.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:54.800]  I'm not trying to beg for him.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.080]  The dude's got throat cancer.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:56.880]  He made me laugh.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.800]  Laughter is medicine.
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.000]  That shit means a lot to me.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.640]  So I want to give forward and help out Deacon Gray.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.560]  So once again, I'll read out his website.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.360]  It's giveforward.com and just search for Deacon Gray.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.840]  He's really close to his goal.
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.440]  He's trying to raise $10,000.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.440]  He's already got $4,120.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.960]  He's almost 50% of the way through 39 donations.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.160]  So he's getting there.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.040]  That's freaking awesome.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.800]  Deacon Gray, shout out brother.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.000]  I hope you get to hear this somehow.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.280]  I hope somebody relays this to you.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.640]  Much respect.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:25.520]  You made me laugh a lot.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.960]  This is the least I can do for you.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:33.040]  So I want to go and read a news article that kind of hit home for me because, well, you'll
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:33.600]  understand why.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.320]  I'm a seed breeder.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.160]  I am Rasta Jeff.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.160]  I do the Agriculture Podcast, but I'm also the guy that owns iRegenetics.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.200]  I am iRegenetics.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.080]  I do the breeding.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:42.880]  I do the selection.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.240]  Jesse is actually part of the team now.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.760]  None of his stuff is available through me yet, but it will be very soon.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.800]  So Jesse is part of the team.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.680]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:52.240]  Jesse grows.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:52.800]  Follow him.
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:58.240]  You'll see his projects coming through, but you'll understand why this hits home now.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.360]  This is from The Cannabis.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:02.000]  The article was written by Jason Blevins.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.520]  It was from the Denver Post originally.
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.520]  It was published December 24th at 5.05 PM.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:12.240]  It says, Pot Grover's new quest, US patent protection for cannabis seeds.
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.120]  Ben Holmes gently lowers the turntable needle onto the album and traffic's medicated goo
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:17.920]  begins to play.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.880]  Steve Wynwood's wistful tenor sweeps through the Centennial Seeds Laboratory.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:25.040]  My own homegrown recipe will see you through.
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.600]  Everyone stole from Steve Wynwood, Holmes says, his foot tapping as he injects a syringe
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.480]  of dark syrupy liquid into his gas chromatograph.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:37.440]  No one is stealing from Holmes, a self-taught scientist, engineer, farmer, and cannabis
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.400]  seed geek who next month will take a rare step to apply for a patent on a laboriously
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.480]  created cannabis super strain.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:49.520]  If it is awarded, the US patent on Holmes' medical grade Auto II strain will be the first
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:54.400]  to protect a cannabis plant and a first step in establishing plant breeder rights for growers
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.960]  who only a few years ago were considered criminals.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.160]  I said the strain is called Auto II.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.680]  It's spelled O-T-T-O and then the Roman numeral II.
[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.280]  It's not auto like auto flower.
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.560]  So I just want to clear that up.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.440]  It's the same word.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.480]  Essentially, I'm saying auto and I would say auto if it were spelled the other way.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.080]  So if you guys are haters of auto flowers, that's not what it is.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.720]  It's just auto like the dude from The Simpsons.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.240]  It's probably got some Canadian influence, I would assume.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:20.960]  Right?
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.280]  Anyway, this industry came up in stealth, born in basements and crawl spaces, Holmes
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.120]  said, but now with companies forming and making larger investments, the desire to protect
[01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.280]  intellectual property is becoming paramount.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.640]  Bleeding edge stuff right here.
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.320]  And this is kind of hits home to me because I breed seeds and I create strains and I see
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:42.240]  people, I don't want to say ripping them off because I don't know if they thought of it
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:47.280]  before me, if they just happened to post it to Instagram after me, but people, we like
[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:50.320]  to borrow names in this industry for strains.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.720]  We think we're coming up with something original.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:53.680]  You guys are going to hear a thumping noise.
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.560]  I'm moving this microphone.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.040]  It's sliding.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:55.280]  Sorry.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:55.680]  Here we go.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:56.800]  Got to tighten this up.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:57.440]  Tighten up now.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:57.920]  Here we go.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:00.960]  Sorry if that sounds like shit in the recording, I'm not going to censor that or edit that
[01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.760]  out at all.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:08.560]  So making stuff, my strains get stolen often and I can't complain about it because I'm
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:10.640]  actually using other people's strains to make mine.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.880]  Somebody had to make the seeds for me to breed with, but just give credit, I guess.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.720]  But now people are going to be able to patent stuff.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:23.760]  So what I'm worried about mainly are people with more money going to punk me and patent
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.280]  my shit and squeeze me right out?
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.080]  Are you going to see other people claiming that they own Capleton?
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.000]  That's what I'm worried about.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.120]  And I don't know the legal parts of this enough to know, but I do know that I don't have any
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.640]  money compared to a lot of these people.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:40.800]  I am small time compared to a lot of these people compared to Greenhouse, compared to
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.720]  the Cali Connection, compared to DNA.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.520]  I am nobody.
[01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:45.920]  And those guys could squeeze me out tomorrow if they wanted to.
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.160]  But luckily we're a friendly industry.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:51.200]  Big business doesn't give a shit about friendly industry.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:53.920]  They'll squeeze us all out by doing this kind of stuff because they've got the money.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.560]  That's what I fear.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:56.240]  But I'm a paranoid hippie.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.080]  I've been on too many fish parking lots to have a clear head about that kind of shit.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.160]  I just always think the paranoid part.
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:04.080]  So let me read more of the article.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.720]  It says, indeed, gone are the days when pie eyed long hairs haphazardly hurled pollen
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.360]  into jungles of pot plants, hoping to meld two strains.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.440]  Damn, that's such a great cliche in one fucking sentence.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.480]  I love that.
[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.280]  Let's see what we got.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.600]  We got pie eyed long hairs.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.080]  So you can see those guys, pie eyed long hairs all, I'm high and I got big eyes, right?
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.680]  Long hair.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.920]  So haphazardly hurling pollen.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.640]  They're just got this male plant and they're just beating it into the room,
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.280]  into jungles of pot plants.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.640]  So no strain selection here.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.000]  Let's just put a bunch of females in here.
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.920]  Sorry, I'm just talking shit about the sentence.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.560]  It was great.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:42.080]  Hoping to meld two strains.
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.520]  Today's top readers are geneticists taking years to weed through carefully engineered
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.800]  generations of cannabis to elevate the most desired traits.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.240]  Now that's a pretty accurate statement.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.120]  I will agree with that.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.960]  Some of the new super strains are high in cannabidiol or CBD,
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.560]  one of several dozen cannabinoid chemical compounds in cannabis
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:02.800]  and the plant's major non-psychoactive ingredient.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:07.760]  Oh man, I was proud because he said chemical compound, but then he said ingredient.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.280]  And then that ruined him.
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.440]  I'm so critical of these guys' articles.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.320]  And I bet I say some really dumb shit on the podcast because I'm high.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.320]  But these guys have editors and proofreaders and shit.
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:17.520]  I'm just here spouting it out.
[01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:23.040]  I've taken dabs and drink mate and can't be held accountable for anything.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:29.360]  I say after that, all right, CBD has been credited with reliving some epileptic seizures,
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.520]  prompting widespread calls for additional research.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.400]  Other more utilitarian super strains are resistant to mites or the crop killing
[01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.440]  powdery mildew that plagues grow operations across Colorado.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.080]  Crop killing powdery mildew that plagues grow operations across Colorado.
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.520]  It sounds like we only have that here.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.680]  They have powdery mildew all over the place, bro.
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.160]  I don't know why you're singling out Colorado.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.200]  It does happen here.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:52.720]  All right.
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:54.000]  I'll quit ranting about that part.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.280]  Let's get more into the article here.
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.960]  Where was I?
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:01.680]  Some super strains are simply super stony with sky high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.480]  or THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.920]  I got to scroll way down.
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.960]  There's like seven ads here.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.520]  Here we go.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.480]  The gas chromatograph is Holmes' key in shaping auto to a high CBD, low THC strain.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.480]  He hopes can feel medical therapies.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.960]  The 50 year old gizmo separates molecules and converts them into an electrical impulse.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.520]  A green line tracking across screen reveals the THC level in the substance.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.400]  That line will be the baseline for a measurement of auto to
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:34.400]  Holmes produces a well-worn label tablet laden with acronyms and millivolt values from the gas
[01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:35.520]  chromatograph.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:41.280]  Those figures reveal his painstaking progress toward breeding the THC out and the CBD into
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.120]  his treasured varietal.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.440]  It is in many ways, the result of a lifelong career dedicated to breeding, growing, cloning,
[01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.000]  engineering, and charting the most useful cannabis plants.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.920]  As Wynwood sings the oft covered Dear Mr. Fantasy, Holmes shares his plans to protect auto too,
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:00.400]  which ranks among the most valuable of his collection of 400 varieties of cannabis seeds,
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.240]  both marijuana and hemp.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:05.600]  Most of which are stored in additional freezer in his Lafayette lab.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.640]  In addition to the patent, he hopes to be the first cannabis breeder to secure protection under
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.400]  the Plant Variety Protection Act.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:16.160]  The Seminole Plant Breeders Rights Legislation from 1970.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.680]  The value of the seed, the value of that seed long-term could be very, very valuable.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.240]  An annuity said Holmes, a father of two who serves on the state's Industrial Hemp Advisory
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:30.880]  Committee and is collaborating on the University of Colorado's groundbreaking
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.200]  Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.800]  And if you guys haven't checked that out, you should.
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:36.160]  I'll say it again.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.440]  It's the Cannabis Genomic Research Initiative.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.760]  There's a link to it in this article on the cannabis.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:45.680]  So if you can find this article on the cannabis, it's the article about pot growers,
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.000]  New Quest, US Patent Protection.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.120]  This link is in that article.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.040]  So everyone who does this wants to produce something with durability.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.200]  He said a seed with good utility that produces well can have longevity for generations,
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:01.920]  which is very true.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:07.360]  I've read a few strains that I can keep those seeds around and that Capleton,
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.040]  the bounty killer will be good forever.
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.240]  I'm going to get back into the article here.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.360]  That was kind of a random rant.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.600]  It says, Holmes is sort of a modern day Luther Burbank, who you should read about guys.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:22.880]  The pioneering American botanist and horticulturist who developed more than 800 varieties and strains
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:25.520]  of plants in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.320]  His name is Luther Burbank, if you want to Google him.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.240]  Wikipedia that guy.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:35.280]  Burbank faced intellectual property challenges in his career as he created still herald peaches,
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.480]  plums, daisies, and the world dominant Burbank russet potato.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:43.760]  Holmes follows Burbank's lead, offering a few types of seeds to a single large distributor
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.440]  who can flood the market in the first year before anyone can take it as their own
[01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.960]  by cloning the young seedlings.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:51.440]  So this guy's idea, and that's a good idea.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:59.360]  He's going to put out so many seeds so quickly that everybody will know it's his because
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.360]  it'll be flooded, but nobody will be able to claim it before they can cut a clone because
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.040]  he'll be so well known for putting it out.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:05.840]  That's pretty smart.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.000]  He just puts out so many that they're like, oh, it's got to be him because everyone's
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:10.800]  got the seeds.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:11.840]  Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.240]  I like that.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:12.800]  It's a good idea.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.520]  I might start hoarding certain strains when I make seeds now.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.680]  Just make a whole bunch of them until I can do that.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.400]  No, I wouldn't do that.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:18.960]  I'm just joking.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:19.760]  Sorry, guys.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:23.920]  By the time copycats have cloned Holmes's strains, he's already, he already has made
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.640]  his money.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.040]  He also licenses the use of his heirloom seeds, but not the extra special seeds he doesn't
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:29.760]  want copied.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.560]  Really, the focus minus any patent protection is non-licensing and careful selection of
[01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.200]  distributors.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:39.680]  Holmes said state trademark protection can safeguard the name of an innovation within
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.240]  a state's borders, but protecting intellectual property through state law is a bandage.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:46.400]  Patents are exclusively federal.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.200]  Marijuana is illegal under federal law and federal law trumps state law.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:55.680]  So this guy could get completely denied for his attempt at patenting his cannabis strain.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:00.640]  But if he does, he's going to open the floodgates for a lot of shit and people will start
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.960]  patenting their own strains.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.440]  I bet you.
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:07.440]  And that means I'm gonna have to get on the game, uh, get lawyered up a little bit harder
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:09.200]  for a lawyer that knows about patent laws too.
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.760]  God, this game is getting so vast.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:15.280]  You have to have your hands in everything now to be able to keep up in this kind of
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:15.760]  a business.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:19.920]  If you guys want to move to Colorado and get in the cannabis industry, I recommend you
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.320]  do like a year of research before you get into it.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.480]  Maybe come here and talk to somebody who's in the industry.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.160]  I can help you out a little bit.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.560]  I don't know a lot about getting into the industry.
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.480]  I don't like into, if you want a dispensary or something, and I don't know how to get
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:32.960]  you into there.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:33.600]  That's going to be hard.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:34.640]  So be careful.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:36.000]  Let's see.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.560]  What else do I want to talk about in this episode?
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.960]  I wanted to talk about the new year is coming up and the new year is always a good time.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.360]  Everybody says they want to do new year's resolutions and stuff.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.680]  I think it's a good time to start a new grow calendar or a schedule to kind of make a game
[01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.000]  plan.
[01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.600]  Clean up your grow room, get everything started fresh again.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:59.920]  And then instead of just cutting a bunch of clones and having a bunch of plants and veg
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.880]  and having some shit over here and some more shit over here, think about what you're going
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:03.200]  to do.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.480]  Think about how many lights you have in each space.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.320]  How many flowering lights do you have?
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.960]  How many plants fit under each of those lights?
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:12.800]  How long do they take to flower?
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:13.360]  Okay.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.480]  So you got about 65 days underneath this light, right?
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.480]  Well, in about 65 days, you need more plants to go under there, but you need a couple of
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:21.360]  days to clean that.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.320]  You got to trim, you got to sweep up, you got to wipe the walls down.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.440]  You got to clean all the dirt out.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.160]  You got to repot.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.760]  You got to get shit back in there.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.120]  Remember that in like nine weeks, you need more plants in there.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.440]  So you got to cut clones about three to four, maybe five weeks before that, depending on
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.840]  how much space you have, you got to get your shit ready.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.880]  So start planning.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.600]  I think it's a good time for you guys to start working on an advanced grow calendar.
[01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.080]  I don't know how you want to do it.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.760]  There are a lot of ways to go about it.
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.280]  Do it your way is what I recommend.
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:52.880]  Maybe we'll make an episode out of that, but it's the start of the year coming up and just
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:53.600]  make a calendar.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.960]  Because if you pop a bunch of seeds, you cut a bunch of clones and you got a bedroom full
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.080]  and a flowering room full, and you don't have a full plan of where those plants are
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.400]  going, you're going to run into some problems.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.320]  Overcrowding causes problems.
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:05.760]  Overcrowding promotes problems.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.120]  You can't see that plant on the bottom.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.120]  You can't tell there was a spider mite infestation there.
[01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:10.240]  You got spider mites everywhere.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.440]  You got way too many plants.
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:12.480]  This shit's out of control.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.160]  Just be diligent.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:14.880]  Think in advance.
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:16.160]  Think ahead of yourself.
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.680]  Be like five steps ahead.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.200]  That's how you be a good grower.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:21.440]  Kind of try to predict what's going to happen in your plants.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:23.360]  Don't just watch and see what happens.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.440]  Be like, oh, this is going to happen because I've grown weed a million times and I've paid
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.880]  attention at least 10 of them.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.080]  All right, I'm ranting again, but that's really important, I think.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:32.880]  And it's the start of the year.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:35.120]  So it's time for that to happen.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.480]  It would be a good time for all of that.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.240]  And clean up all your shit right at the start of the year.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.680]  If your carbon filters are all mucky, buy some new carbon filters.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:43.840]  If your bulbs are all shitty, get some new bulbs.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.040]  It's the start of the year.
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.240]  Spoil your gardens.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.520]  They spoil you back.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.440]  That's my advice.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.360]  That's my personal advice from the heart of Rasta Jeff.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.120]  God, I must be dabbed out.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:56.720]  I'm saying from the heart of Rasta Jeff.
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:57.520]  Grow from your heart, right?
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:58.160]  That's what I say.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.680]  All right, I'm going to wrap up this episode, you guys.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:03.040]  I hope you join me next week.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.240]  It's going to be another quick episode.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.960]  I'm going to go see the string cheese on the 29th, 30th, and 31st.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.200]  The string cheese incident at the Broomfield.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:13.200]  It's the first bank center in Broomfield.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.640]  If you happen to run into me, say what's up.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:15.280]  Don't be shy.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:16.640]  I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks.
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.640]  I'm probably wearing an Irie Genetics hoodie.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:23.040]  If I'm a tall white guy with dreadlocks and there's a little short chick with dreadlocks
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.000]  next to me and she's sweet looking, that's probably me.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.200]  There's going to be a lot of people that match that description, but I'm probably wearing
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.840]  the Irie hoodie and she's probably got the Irie hoodie.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.640]  I might have...
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:35.440]  I'll try to remember to take some stickers or something with me and throw them in my
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.560]  back pocket so that if you say what's up, shake my hand, give me a hug, I'll give you
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:39.040]  a sticker.
[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.360]  It'll be really funny when you hug the wrong hippie because there's going to be a bunch
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.800]  of tall white guys with dreadlocks there.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.280]  So say what's up to me at the string cheese incident.
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:49.040]  If you see me, I hope to see you there.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.240]  Maybe we'll smoke down or something.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:52.000]  I'll have some dabs with me if we're not on the show.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.480]  I don't know how I'm going to sneak my rig into the show, but I'll definitely have a
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:54.880]  spliff.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.760]  All right, let's wrap this up.
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.760]  Man, happy new year, you guys.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:00.640]  You guys might be...
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:01.520]  When are you listening to this?
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.720]  You might hear this on New Year's.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.520]  Let me look at the calendar.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.720]  When does this come out?
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.320]  When does this come out, bro?
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.560]  Go into the calendar.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.840]  I'm not even going to press pause on the recording.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:10.320]  I'm just going to do it.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.480]  I'm going to try not to do any editing anymore.
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:12.960]  What do you think?
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.720]  Do you like it when I just talk a lot and don't...
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:18.720]  Do you like it when I talk about my life and my stuff and I don't just keep
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.320]  talking about weed and have it all scripted?
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:22.000]  Or do you want me to keep it tight?
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.040]  I want to know what you think.
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.880]  So this episode will come out on the 29th.
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:26.240]  Oh, shit.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:26.880]  You guys are probably...
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:30.400]  I hope you're listening to this on your way driving to the cheese show, wherever you are.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:31.920]  So if you see me at String Cheese, give me a hug.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:33.040]  The next...
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.680]  Happy new year also, because Wednesday is the new year.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.320]  So happy new year.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.600]  I hope you guys are safe, dude.
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.640]  Don't drink and drive.
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:40.240]  Be safe.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.440]  Take care of one another.
[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:42.960]  Keep an eye out for each other.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.360]  I don't...
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.240]  I want everybody to be able to see all your friends again tomorrow.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.920]  So have a happy new year, you guys.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.400]  I love you guys.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.600]  Thanks for listening to the show.
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:53.680]  There's nothing cooler than having people that email you and tweet you until they're listening.
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:58.880]  So now that the show is over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher and find the iTunes or Stitcher main
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.120]  page.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.240]  Search for iGroww Culture.

[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.800]  I'm going to have to change all of that stuff to Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:25.600]  I hope all of those services will let me change my name at least once.
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.120]  I'm not sure how it's going to work, but I'll do it.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.840]  I'm more focused on the string cheese concerts.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.800]  I'll be gone for three days.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.760]  I'll be gone for like four days.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.720]  So I'm more worried about that right now than I am getting the show stuff done because I
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:37.760]  don't have a logo yet and all that.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.400]  But once I get the logo going, we'll get it happening at the start of the year, you guys.
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:41.440]  It'll all be rocking.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.400]  Stay with me, please.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.400]  Don't abandon me right around episode 50.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.040]  That'd be weird.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.160]  Also, follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.440]  That's not going anywhere.
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:53.200]  Well, unless Instagram fucks me like Facebook did.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.320]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product you'd like

[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:01.360]  info you need.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.680]  We do need a theme song and a logo.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.880]  Big, super huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:08.240]  Also, big shout out to Maddie.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.760]  Big shout out to my moms for the super cool camera and other cool gifts.
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.800]  Big shout out to Angela.
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:13.280]  Love you, babe.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.120]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.960]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.000]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:37.290]  Yeah, what's up, guys?
[01:37:37.290 --> 01:37:40.570]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:37:40.570 --> 01:37:40.970]  That's right.
[01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:41.610]  I made the switch.
[01:37:41.610 --> 01:37:46.490]  It is now the official Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education,

[01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:53.850]  Today is Saturday.
[01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:55.370]  It's the Saturday after the new year.
[01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.130]  It's the first Saturday of the new year.
[01:37:57.850 --> 01:38:01.450]  Hope everybody had a great, safe, joyous new year.
[01:38:01.450 --> 01:38:03.610]  I have a few people to thank and a few things to talk about.
[01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:07.050]  But before we get that far, let's pay a couple of bills.

[01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:58.090]  Jesse and I have been talking a little.
[01:39:58.090 --> 01:40:02.570]  Jesse's been kind of a busy dude, but we are working on putting together some prizes for
[01:40:02.570 --> 01:40:03.370]  episode 50.
[01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:07.530]  That's we're going to hang out in a day or two, and that's going to be our priority of
[01:40:07.530 --> 01:40:08.250]  the conversation.

[01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:11.690]  We'll talk a little bit about my sniffles here in a little bit.
[01:40:11.690 --> 01:40:15.050]  I saw the string of cheese incident for three nights in Denver, and I may have gotten a
[01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:17.770]  little bit sniffly during that minus 16 night.
[01:40:18.650 --> 01:40:22.010]  This podcast is also brought to you by our good friends at TreeThugger.com.
[01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.970]  This episode is brought to you.
[01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:24.090]  I just read that part, huh?

[01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.090]  A big shout out.
[01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:38.010]  Much love to both or all three of the sponsors.
[01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:38.890]  I'm high and stumbling.
[01:40:38.890 --> 01:40:40.810]  I got to get my rhythm in this episode.
[01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:41.290]  All right.
[01:40:41.290 --> 01:40:43.690]  So I want to give a big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:46.490]  The song you heard at the opening of the show was called the Doggy Dub from our good
[01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:47.930]  friends, the Mystic Roots.
[01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:48.890]  Shout out to Cat and Coot.
[01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:50.330]  I hope you guys had a great new year.
[01:40:50.890 --> 01:40:52.410]  I hope everybody had a great new year.
[01:40:52.410 --> 01:40:54.490]  I was talking about going to see the string of cheese incident.
[01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:56.650]  So we'll talk about that a little bit.
[01:40:56.650 --> 01:41:00.250]  I got to go see, if you don't know about the string of cheese, they're a jam band from
[01:41:00.250 --> 01:41:00.890]  Colorado.
[01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:03.370]  They're from the Boulder Estes Park area.
[01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:05.130]  They're from all over the place up there.
[01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:08.330]  So you can't pick one place to say, but that's where they're from is that kind of area.
[01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:11.050]  They started off as kind of a bluegrassy jam band.
[01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:14.330]  Now they're kind of a more of a psychedelic dubstep jam band.
[01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:18.090]  They've got two drummers, or they've got a drummer and a guy that plays percussion.
[01:41:18.090 --> 01:41:20.250]  They've got a keyboard player that tears it up.
[01:41:20.250 --> 01:41:24.570]  They've got an electric guitar player who plays fiddle and electric guitar and mandolin
[01:41:24.570 --> 01:41:25.210]  like a champ.
[01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:27.850]  Bill Nershey plays acoustic guitar.
[01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:31.450]  And then their bass player is, he's solid, dude.
[01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:33.450]  He doesn't like stand out.
[01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:36.250]  He's not super flashy, but he never missed a note in three nights.
[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:40.090]  So the string cheese incident, they play, the only way I can describe it, dude, is carnival
[01:41:40.090 --> 01:41:40.410]  music.
[01:41:40.410 --> 01:41:41.370]  It's Calypso music.
[01:41:41.370 --> 01:41:42.250]  It's Mambo music.
[01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:42.890]  It's Samba.
[01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:43.530]  It's rock.
[01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:44.170]  It's funk.
[01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:46.650]  It's reggae, but it's like one giant carnival.
[01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:49.450]  The whole party, the whole concert was one giant carnival.
[01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:50.650]  It was a great time.
[01:41:50.650 --> 01:41:51.930]  So we saw string cheese incident.
[01:41:51.930 --> 01:41:54.730]  They did three nights at the first bank center in Broomfield.
[01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:59.370]  So we drove up to, it was actually in Westminster is where our hotel was.
[01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:00.490]  So we drove up to the hotel.
[01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:01.370]  We stayed in the hotel.
[01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:03.530]  We went and saw the first show.
[01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:05.770]  And after the first set, they do three nights.
[01:42:05.770 --> 01:42:09.530]  And the first night they played for about an hour and 15, took a break, and then came
[01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:12.890]  out for about another hour and a half and tore that night up.
[01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:16.730]  After the first set of the first night, I said, where are they going to go from here?
[01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.370]  Because they came out and they just tore it up right off the bat.
[01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:22.410]  They didn't start like, let's start slow and build it up.
[01:42:22.410 --> 01:42:25.530]  No, they started like, let's come out on fire and just fuck this all up.
[01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:26.090]  And they did it.
[01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.970]  It was amazing.
[01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:29.530]  So big thanks to the string cheese incident.
[01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.650]  That was awesome.
[01:42:30.650 --> 01:42:33.530]  So day two, or we finished the show night one, went back to the hotel.
[01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:34.650]  We're beat, pretty much slept.
[01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:38.650]  Day two, we kind of just hung out in the hotel and we're lazy.
[01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:39.210]  It was cold.
[01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:41.450]  It was minus 16 degrees that day.
[01:42:42.090 --> 01:42:45.610]  And there was no real reason to leave the hotel other than to get food.
[01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:47.450]  We had dabs and drinks and everything we needed.
[01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:50.010]  So we just hung out in the hotel until time for the show.
[01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:51.850]  The second night was amazing.
[01:42:52.650 --> 01:42:55.770]  We pretty much, we ditched the shows at the end and head right back to the hotel.
[01:42:55.770 --> 01:42:57.450]  We're not real party animals anymore.
[01:42:57.450 --> 01:42:59.370]  I don't need to eat a bunch of drugs and get spun out.
[01:42:59.370 --> 01:43:02.970]  I wanted to go home and get prepared for the next day because New Year's was a big party.
[01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:09.450]  They started a little bit early and they played until about 145, if I remember correctly,
[01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:13.450]  they started at 845 and went to 145 with a couple of breaks.
[01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:17.610]  String cheese incident on New Year's.
[01:43:19.050 --> 01:43:21.690]  I've never seen so much confetti, so many balloons.
[01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:23.610]  I can't even begin to describe what it was like.
[01:43:23.610 --> 01:43:26.970]  We were, me and my girlfriend, Angela, were in the front three rows,
[01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:30.650]  right in front of Bill Nershey and kind of off to the side from Kyle.
[01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:32.410]  So there was a huge party right there.
[01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:35.290]  And after the first or second night, everybody knew who we were.
[01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:37.210]  So everyone just treated us like friends and family.
[01:43:37.290 --> 01:43:40.730]  So big shout out to all the new friends and family that I made from the string cheese incident.
[01:43:40.730 --> 01:43:44.490]  But man, they had these giant, they look like cocoons hanging from the ceiling when we walked
[01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:46.730]  in that night and you couldn't identify what they were.
[01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:50.810]  But as the midnight countdown began, these cocoons opened up and there were,
[01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:52.970]  they became giant flowers that were lit up.
[01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:54.330]  And it was pretty amazing.
[01:43:54.330 --> 01:43:57.050]  I posted video on my Facebook.
[01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:59.930]  If you guys want to check that out, you'll have to find my personal Facebook.
[01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:02.730]  I shouldn't have said that, but there are a lot of cool videos of it.
[01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:03.450]  Check it out.
[01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:04.250]  It was amazing.
[01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:05.370]  I was covered in confetti.
[01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:06.970]  There were so many balloons.
[01:44:06.970 --> 01:44:12.090]  So big thanks to Angela for letting me go, inviting me to be your new year's buddy.
[01:44:12.090 --> 01:44:14.650]  And also for, thanks for that sweet new year's kiss, babe.
[01:44:14.650 --> 01:44:15.290]  We needed that.
[01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:16.090]  It meant a lot to me.
[01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:17.690]  Let's see.
[01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:19.850]  Big thanks to all the cheese kids and fans that I made.
[01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:20.490]  I made a list here.
[01:44:20.490 --> 01:44:22.170]  I'm going to try to get some of these people in here.
[01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:23.210]  I'm going to skip a bunch though.
[01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:24.570]  Big thanks to Pam and Jessica.
[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.290]  I met Pam for the first time.
[01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:28.730]  Angela speaks very highly of you.
[01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:29.610]  And now I see why.
[01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.530]  Jessica, I just met that night.
[01:44:31.530 --> 01:44:32.810]  Had never heard of her.
[01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:34.410]  She's a big ball of smiley energy.
[01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:35.850]  It was great to meet you and hang out with you.
[01:44:36.570 --> 01:44:38.090]  Big thanks to Mama Cass.
[01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.970]  It was great meeting you.
[01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:40.410]  Nice lady that calls herself Mama Cass.
[01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:41.290]  She had a lot of great energy.
[01:44:41.290 --> 01:44:42.490]  Had a lot of good things to say.
[01:44:43.130 --> 01:44:44.730]  Big thanks to the guy with the amazing candy.
[01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:45.770]  I cannot remember your name.
[01:44:46.410 --> 01:44:49.690]  This dude next to me offered me a lemon, excuse me.
[01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:50.890]  He offered me a lemon candy.
[01:44:51.690 --> 01:44:54.010]  And I said, is it just candy?
[01:44:54.010 --> 01:44:58.170]  And he said, yeah, man, my thing is to just bring weird candies to the show and they're delicious.
[01:44:58.170 --> 01:45:00.410]  And so I took this lemon candy from him and it was amazing.
[01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:02.650]  And later on in the show, he offered me something.
[01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:05.690]  And when he pulled it out of his pocket, the guy next to him patted me on the shoulder
[01:45:05.690 --> 01:45:07.450]  and said, eat one of those, man.
[01:45:07.450 --> 01:45:09.130]  And when I tried it, it was amazing.
[01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:13.130]  It was some, all the packaging was in another language.
[01:45:13.130 --> 01:45:14.810]  It's like Chinese or Korean or something.
[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:15.770]  I'm sorry if that's offensive.
[01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:16.890]  I don't know what fucking language it is.
[01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:18.250]  It looks Chinese to me.
[01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:21.850]  And it was mango flavored and whatever I ate was amazing, dude.
[01:45:21.850 --> 01:45:23.050]  And it did not have drugs in it.
[01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:26.410]  So I was pretty relieved about an hour later when I wasn't flipping my face off.
[01:45:26.970 --> 01:45:28.810]  So a big shout to the candy guy.
[01:45:28.810 --> 01:45:32.890]  Also a big shout out to Dan, Karin, Roland, and Riley.
[01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:35.210]  It was a pleasure meeting all of my new friends.
[01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:36.250]  You guys are great.
[01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:37.690]  Great little family you guys have there.
[01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:39.690]  Also a shout out to the girl that we named Titty Girl.
[01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:41.370]  I never met her.
[01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:45.050]  We never met her, but her boobs and her vibes were amazing and fun to watch.
[01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:49.290]  She was so exposed that my girlfriend told me to look because it was ridiculous.
[01:45:49.290 --> 01:45:50.330]  She said, look to your left.
[01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:52.730]  That girl's boobs are out of her shirt.
[01:45:52.730 --> 01:45:56.250]  And I looked and it was, it wasn't even like I was looking to be a pervert.
[01:45:56.250 --> 01:45:59.930]  I was more looking like, is she really having her tits out of her shirt that much at the show?
[01:45:59.930 --> 01:46:02.170]  It was kind of entertaining, kind of ridiculous.
[01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:03.450]  So big shout out to Titty Girl.
[01:46:03.450 --> 01:46:04.250]  She's a good dancer.
[01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.130]  She had a lot of good energy.
[01:46:05.130 --> 01:46:09.050]  She brought a little crew of chicks with her that twirled around and brought a nice little vibe.
[01:46:09.050 --> 01:46:10.090]  So that was neat.
[01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:14.810]  Dude, some of the girls at the show, they wear this eye makeup with beads in it, dude.
[01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:16.810]  And I don't understand how you ladies do that stuff.
[01:46:17.530 --> 01:46:20.810]  You got like, I'm serious, like right in the corner of your eye where you wake up with
[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:24.330]  eye crusties on the outside, not near your nose, but the other side, they've got little
[01:46:24.330 --> 01:46:25.290]  beads and shit there.
[01:46:26.090 --> 01:46:29.610]  I don't understand how ladies tolerate that shit all night on your face, but I do however
[01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:31.850]  think it's cute and I totally appreciate the effort.
[01:46:32.410 --> 01:46:36.970]  But it does make me be extra glad to be the guy with dreadlocks.
[01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:40.490]  I wake up, sometimes I take a shower occasionally.
[01:46:40.490 --> 01:46:44.170]  I mostly wake up, put on some clothes, throw on a t-shirt, shake my head, put on a hat,
[01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:44.970]  and I'm ready to rock.
[01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:48.250]  You can't tell if I just woke up or if I've been working all day.
[01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:51.290]  So it makes me extra grateful to be a guy that can be lazy.
[01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:53.770]  But also thank you ladies for looking great at the cheese show.
[01:46:53.770 --> 01:46:55.370]  Angela, thank you for looking wonderful.
[01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:57.690]  Thanks again for letting me have a good time.
[01:46:58.330 --> 01:47:00.330]  I did mention I got a little cold, I guess.
[01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:01.370]  I got some sniffles, bro.
[01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:02.890]  I just sniffled right in the mic to do that.
[01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:03.370]  That was rude.
[01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:08.730]  But it was minus 16 degrees one night and you got to go from the car into the concert
[01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:09.930]  venue in the minus 16.
[01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:14.410]  And then in the concert, I just, I took off all my jackets and I had my t-shirt and my
[01:47:14.410 --> 01:47:17.610]  pants on and my shoes and my hat and I was sweating my ass off.
[01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:22.890]  So you got to try to negotiate the cold and then the super hot heat and then back to the
[01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:25.770]  car again and then let the car warm up and get to the hotel.
[01:47:25.770 --> 01:47:29.370]  So I think all the climate changes, I may have got a little cold here.
[01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:33.530]  And also I smoked like 45 joints over three nights at these concerts where I rolled a
[01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:34.490]  bunch of joints.
[01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:38.650]  I smoked like 45 joints with strangers and I'm wondering if maybe I got a little bit
[01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:40.650]  of string cheese incident, wook flu.
[01:47:41.530 --> 01:47:42.330]  But whatever, I'll live.
[01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:44.170]  I got some emergency and some yerba mate.
[01:47:44.170 --> 01:47:45.370]  I'm going to be just fine.
[01:47:46.090 --> 01:47:48.090]  It was fun meeting a lot of Instagram followers.
[01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:48.890]  I met a lot of people.
[01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:52.490]  They walked up to me and they said, hey, are you Irie Genetics or are you Rasta Jeff?
[01:47:52.490 --> 01:47:56.090]  That's always kind of nice when you're just out randomly somewhere that there's a band
[01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:58.650]  playing and you're not like, it wasn't a weed event.
[01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:00.890]  I shouldn't have been getting any attention, but people knew who I was.
[01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:01.450]  It was kind of neat.
[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:05.290]  So big shout out to all those folks that said, hi, I really appreciate that.
[01:48:05.290 --> 01:48:06.250]  I'm digging through notes here.
[01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:10.650]  Oh, huge shout out to Aaron Brooks on the very last night we were walking out of the
[01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:10.970]  venue.
[01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:16.090]  And if my girlfriend didn't have to pee, we would not have bumped into each other.
[01:48:16.090 --> 01:48:17.610]  So I'm so glad she had to pee.
[01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:19.450]  And I bumped into Aaron Brooks and got a big old hug.
[01:48:19.450 --> 01:48:20.650]  Aaron Brooks is an artist.
[01:48:20.650 --> 01:48:22.330]  If you're not following him, you should be.
[01:48:23.210 --> 01:48:23.530]  Let's see.
[01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:24.650]  What else do I need to talk about?
[01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:25.690]  I wrote down a lot of stuff.
[01:48:25.690 --> 01:48:26.570]  I feel like I'm rambling.
[01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:28.170]  We're already 11 minutes in.
[01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:31.530]  Is this is going to be another one of those short, quick episodes with just me.
[01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:36.890]  I put a lot of work into this podcast, but this week I was obviously busy seeing the
[01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:37.770]  string cheese incident.
[01:48:37.770 --> 01:48:38.810]  I've been out of town.
[01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:39.930]  I was gone for four days.
[01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:43.770]  It took me a whole day to get my gardens back to where I felt they should be.
[01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:44.810]  They missed me.
[01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:47.130]  And then I needed a day to get myself back together.
[01:48:47.130 --> 01:48:49.450]  I tried to record yesterday, but it was chaotic.
[01:48:49.450 --> 01:48:49.930]  So here I am.
[01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:52.410]  I'm recording this quick, short episode because I love you guys.
[01:48:52.410 --> 01:48:54.570]  And I don't want to leave you hanging for a whole week.
[01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:59.450]  But I do promise that the next episodes are going to be back to what you expect.
[01:48:59.450 --> 01:49:03.610]  48, 49, and 50 are going to be stellar episodes.
[01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:07.050]  I'm hoping to get Spencer on pretty soon, but I never teased you about that.
[01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:08.410]  Let's see.
[01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:10.250]  Sorry, I'm choking.
[01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:11.610]  I'm going to take a quick drink here.
[01:49:11.610 --> 01:49:12.730]  Take a dab while I take a drink.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.400]  Oh, shout out to water and root beer.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.080]  Those things keep me alive.
[01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.880]  So remind you guys of the name change.
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.000]  That's my next note.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.160]  I'm sure you noticed at the beginning of the show that I said,
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.320]  welcome to the iGrow Culture podcast.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:31.880]  I'm doing my best to roll out the new name.
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.400]  I'm doing it slowly so I don't lose people.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:38.440]  So if it looks confusing for a little bit, I'm sure you guys are aware what's going on
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.160]  if you're listening.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:43.320]  But we are in the process of changing the name from iGrow Culture to Grow From Your Heart.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:43.960]  Bear with me.
[01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:47.320]  I still could use more logos.
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:50.440]  Somebody sent me one logo, but I asked for a couple of adjustments.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.040]  It just didn't fit the way I needed it to fit to make squares out of it.
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:54.920]  I need a square logo.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:50:01.640]  So if you can send me a 1400 by 1400 pixel image with the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:02.520]  I would love that.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:05.080]  I also need a song.
[01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.960]  If you guys want to, if anybody out there is an artist and you want to make a Grow From
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:12.040]  Your Heart podcast theme song, I will compensate you in the future.
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:13.320]  That'd be really cool.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:16.840]  So I'm starting to change the title in social media places also.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:20.200]  I'm waiting on a couple of artists to submit some logos that I've commissioned.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:23.640]  And once I've got all the artwork, I can fully roll out the new title and start switching
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:24.280]  everything over.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.400]  I'm hoping by episode 50 that we can actually just call this the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.080]  and everything will be switched right over.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.080]  Let's see.
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:35.880]  Also, here's something that I've been considering.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.720]  This is just a personal thing for myself that I'm considering doing.
[01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:44.440]  I may cancel the Instagram for the podcast.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:51.400]  There is an iGrow Culture podcast Instagram that I haven't posted anything to in several
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:51.720]  weeks.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.000]  Honestly, it's just a distraction.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:55.640]  There's not a lot.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.840]  It's a podcast and some of my guests don't want me to take their picture.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.280]  Jesse doesn't want his face on.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.200]  Adam is cool with it.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.000]  Mike is cool with it.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:04.680]  But some people do not want to be seen.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:10.520]  And I feel like I'm just going to overdo my Instagram presence by having the iRegenetics
[01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.560]  and the iGrow Culture or the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:17.400]  So I'm thinking about just combining the two into one entity.
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:21.560]  And maybe I'll start posting a few things from the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:23.400]  On the iRegenetics Instagram.
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:28.760]  So if you're not already following iRegenetics on Instagram, go there and follow that.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.160]  Because I'm really considering taking down the Instagram for the podcast.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:34.120]  It's just a distraction.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.400]  It's one more thing to worry about.
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:40.840]  I'm also considering, and I'm not committing to this, but it's highly likely.
[01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:43.400]  Somebody had a talk with me and it got me thinking.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.720]  But I'm considering canceling my YouTube account for the iGrow Culture Grow From Your Heart
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.840]  podcast.
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:49.960]  You'd say, why would you do that?
[01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:50.840]  People are listening.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:54.040]  They are, but not as many.
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:54.600]  And I'm not...
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:00.040]  I appreciate the people that are listening, but it takes me a long time to get those episodes
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:00.280]  up there.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:03.560]  I feel if I cancel that, I feel I can focus more on the show.
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:07.720]  And if I didn't have to create as many different types of media, I can make better content
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:09.640]  just for the audio podcast.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.080]  I'd rather spend the time creating content instead of editing video and setting up a
[01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:18.360]  camera and lighting and editing the video again and then rendering the video for YouTube.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:19.800]  It takes a few...
[01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.040]  It's just a few more steps, but all of those steps matter.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:27.160]  I could spend that much time preparing for this show and making the show that much better,
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:31.080]  having that many more details, being that much more prepared, getting that much better
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:32.280]  of a guest on.
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:36.520]  So the Instagram and the YouTube may go away.
[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.720]  And that's just personal things.
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.960]  I'm trying to free up more time to take what I'm really passionate about to the next level.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:46.600]  I don't want to drag my feet on things that are not fulfilling me, honestly.
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.280]  So I may eliminate those.
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.360]  And I do appreciate the guys that watch me on YouTube.
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:55.720]  I've only gotten like 17 or 18, maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because like I said, it takes
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.320]  me an hour to make each one.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:52:58.600]  And I feel like I could...
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:59.480]  I'm repeating myself.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:01.240]  I could just spend that time doing stuff.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:02.920]  So I may take them down.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:05.560]  I don't want to abandon people.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:10.520]  But if you are watching on YouTube, you should be able to find it on the iGrow culture or
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.440]  the iReed Genetics website.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.040]  Every podcast is there.
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.800]  And if you've got a browser, it works the same.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.280]  You're not missing anything visually, really.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:19.880]  So those are mostly distractions.
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:24.280]  I feel like I'm going to stop contributing to those just so that I can improve the audio
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:25.560]  part of the show.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.600]  So I feel like I'm talking about that for a long time.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:29.480]  I need to move on.
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:30.200]  Let's see.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.880]  I appreciate all the emails I've gotten.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.920]  Holy crap, you guys.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:37.560]  We're going to continue to use the iGrowculture at hotmail.com email address for now.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:42.680]  By episode 50, I will have created the new email address and I'll start talking about
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.960]  it and you can email me there.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:48.840]  But from now on, or for now, keep using the iGrowculture at hotmail.com email address.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.120]  I did change the Twitter.
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:51.400]  It's still at iGrowculture.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:54.040]  But if you look at it, the name is Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:58.440]  It won't let me change my at name, only my display name.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:02.200]  So that's something you can pay attention to.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:02.600]  Let's see.
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:06.120]  I wrote a bunch of notes and I have them in my computer and I'm scrolling through the
[01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:09.400]  computer and looking at a piece of paper, trying to read two things at once.
[01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:11.720]  And it's honestly not working.
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:14.120]  So episode 50 is coming up.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.240]  You guys have been talking about that.
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:18.200]  I'm planning a small celebration episode, but I would like your input.
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.080]  I asked for this on the last episode, but I want to know who your favorite guests were.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.160]  What were some of your favorite moments and what did you learn and what would you like
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.200]  to hear next?
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:29.640]  So like I said, send me some input.
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:31.400]  It's iGrowculture at hotmail.com.
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:34.520]  You can tweet me or you can find me on Facebook.
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:37.640]  It looks like I need to change the Facebook also, you guys.
[01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:41.880]  So it's still iGrowculture, but pretty soon it's going to be the Grow From Your Heart
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:43.560]  podcast on Facebook.
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:44.680]  All right.
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.360]  I feel like I, crap, sorry.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:49.880]  I feel like I got you guys caught up on all of the stuff I had to remind you of and talk
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:50.440]  about.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:54.600]  So now I think it's time to read a couple of news articles that I picked out for the
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:54.840]  day.
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:55:01.640]  This one says Colorado seeks federal okay for state colleges to grow pot.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.840]  A lot of people from out of state are going, what?
[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.280]  But it'll make sense.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:07.720]  This article is from the Denver Post.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:09.080]  It's written by John Engold.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.320]  It says, Colorado has made an unusual plea to federal authorities.
[01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:15.080]  Let our colleges grow pot.
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:19.080]  In a letter sent last month, the state attorney general's office asks federal health and
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:24.120]  education officials for permission on Colorado's colleges and universities to obtain marijuana
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:28.200]  from non-federal government resources for research purposes.
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:33.160]  The letter isn't more specific on how the state's higher education institutions might
[01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:38.840]  score weed, but it was sent pursuant to a law passed in 2014 requiring state officials
[01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.800]  to ask that Colorado colleges and universities be allowed to cultivate marijuana and its
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:44.760]  component parts.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:52.200]  Current research is riddled with bias or insufficiencies and often conflict with one another, reads
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:55.160]  the letter written by deputy attorney general David Blake.
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:59.400]  It is critical that we be allowed to fill the void of scientific research, and this
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.880]  may only be done with your assistance and cooperation.
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:04.680]  The request is not a long shot.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:09.400]  While marijuana is, with qualifications, legal in Colorado, it remains illegal under federal
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:14.200]  law, and getting permission to conduct research on cannabis requires clearing a set of high
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:19.160]  hurdles, approval from multiple federal agencies, and strict requirements on how marijuana must
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.200]  be handled and stored.
[01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:25.000]  Researchers that work without the federal government's blessing risk losing crucial
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.920]  federal funding for their institutions, not to mention possible imprisonment.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:38.680]  An international treaty that the United States signed onto requires the federal government
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:43.080]  to designate only one place in the country that can legally grow marijuana for research.
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:48.840]  Since 1968, that place has been the University of Mississippi's National Care for Natural
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.640]  Products Research, which cultivates cannabis on a 12-acre plot and sends it to approved
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:54.360]  researchers.
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:00.440]  That 12-acre plot is rumored to be where the G13 came from many years ago out of University
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.560]  of Mississippi.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.320]  So if you know anything about that, send me some info.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:04.200]  I'd like to know about it.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:05.720]  All right.
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:12.280]  The article goes on to say, coincidentally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse recently
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.400]  put the government's pot farm contract up for rebid.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:21.080]  Applicants need to have 12 acres of secured and video monitored outdoor space and 1,000
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:25.880]  feet of indoor space to grow marijuana to be able to make marijuana extractions, test
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:31.080]  for potency, and prepare, preferably by hand rolling a small batch of marijuana cigarettes,
[01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:33.080]  according to the official solicitation.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:38.040]  The contract's winner is expected to be announced in the next couple of months.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.360]  A spokeswoman for the National Institute of Drug Abuse would not say how many institutions
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.920]  applied for the contract or where they were.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:45.400]  Sorry.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:51.320]  Spokesman for the University of Colorado and Colorado State University said their schools
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.120]  did not apply.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.560]  The Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014 massively increased the amount of pot the
[01:57:57.560 --> 01:58:04.040]  government's official supplier can grow from 21 kilos to 650 kilos.
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:08.280]  The increase was the result of a boom in marijuana research interest, and the University of
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:13.000]  Mississippi has pledged to grow new strains of marijuana to give research more options
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.280]  for their studies.
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.440]  It was a long time ago, there was a video out, a movie.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.880]  I cannot recall the name of the movie.
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:19.720]  It was something like The Union.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:21.240]  It may have been in The Union.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:25.400]  It may have been How Weed Won the West, maybe.
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:29.320]  I can't remember the name of which movie it was, but they actually showed us inside of
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:34.440]  this facility in Mississippi where they grow this cannabis, and it was terrible.
[01:58:35.720 --> 01:58:37.880]  They weren't growing high-grade cannabis.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:42.520]  I bitch about the weed at the dispensaries, and I would rather smoke the weed at the dispensaries
[01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:46.440]  than the bullshit that I saw being grown at University of Mississippi.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.440]  That stuff was terrible.
[01:58:49.160 --> 01:58:50.920]  It's not really cool that they're doing the research with that.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:55.800]  I hope since then they've gotten a real grower, and they've gotten some genetics, and they've
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:57.720]  learned a few things, because what I saw was shit.
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.960]  We'll continue with the article.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:03.640]  It says, still, the Colorado Attorney General's letter says the federal government falls short
[01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:07.880]  of being able to supply researchers with the kinds of products available in Colorado's
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:10.680]  commercial marijuana market.
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:15.960]  State health officials have just approved up to $8.4 million in grants for marijuana
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:20.840]  studies, some of which will examine Colorado-specific products, but the attorney general's
[01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.480]  office says more needs to be done.
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:29.080]  We need the support of our federal partners to overcome the inertia that continues to
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:32.520]  complicate state efforts in this area, the letter states.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:34.840]  It seems like they caught on.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.360]  They know that we've got the dank here in Colorado.
[01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:43.640]  They know that they need to test, excuse me, they know they need to examine Colorado-specific
[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.520]  products.
[01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:45.640]  So maybe they are catching on.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:48.840]  Maybe they know that that stuff that they're growing out there at that university is a
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:49.560]  bunch of mids.
[01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.600]  Speaking of mids, shout out to my buddy, Vigor Lover.
[01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:53.720]  I hope you're doing well, bro.
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:56.840]  So what this says, this article, I'm going to talk about this a minute.
[01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:04.680]  We are actually asking the federal government to let the state colleges or higher educational
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:08.120]  centers in Colorado to grow cannabis.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.320]  They want to grow pot.
[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:18.360]  That means there will be courses or a class that is accredited to a college where somebody
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.320]  is growing weed.
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:23.640]  It's probably going to be a chemistry class or a biology class.
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:27.000]  It probably won't be a horticulture class because they're not worried about growing
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:27.320]  it.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.280]  They're more worried about the effects and science, and they know how to grow it.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.000]  That's horticulture.
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.120]  That's already done.
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:39.000]  These guys are going to probably have some students doing, making extracts, testing the
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:39.640]  extracts.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:43.800]  I'm not even sure what they're going to do, but I'm impressed and I'm excited.
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:49.000]  I hope this works because I would love to see cannabis grown in a university and tested
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:53.800]  here in Colorado where we're not scared and trying to lie about all of the results.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:01:00.440]  And to see possibly some of my friends that are college students able to study cannabis
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:04.840]  in this way in a college and actually get college credit and build a future for themselves,
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.720]  I really like this.
[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:11.720]  I really love that cannabis has kind of opened doors and gone from us hiding to letting us
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:13.960]  kind of make a living for ourselves.
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:19.080]  This demographic, this age group of 25 to 40 year old males, and there are females in
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:22.600]  there too, but honestly, the majority is males.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:23.560]  We were struggling.
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:24.360]  We were broke.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:28.680]  And now the 25 to 40 year old demographic has something to do with ourselves.
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.760]  We can grow great cannabis and get in the industry.
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:31.240]  It's great.
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:32.040]  All right.
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.280]  So here's another news article, guys.
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.880]  I feel like I'm going really fast.
[02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:37.320]  Sorry, I'm talking so fast.
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:39.560]  I've had some yerba mate and I'm drinking a root beer.
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.400]  Maybe I just need to slow down a little bit.
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:42.520]  We're 25 minutes in.
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:46.840]  It's going to be a short episode, but I promised you that anyway, so it's okay.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:50.200]  I found this article on the cannabis as well, and I found it entertaining.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.120]  It says, it's actually a long article.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.840]  I only want to read one piece of it to you guys.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:00.920]  It says, cannabis Q&A, naming strains and federal rescheduling riddle.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.720]  The part I want to read about is naming strains.
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:08.520]  This is from, it's by Susan Squibb on the cannabis staff, and the header is,
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:09.960]  welcome to our cannabis column.
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:12.280]  Welcome to our ask the cannabis column.
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:16.520]  Clearly you have questions about marijuana, be it a legal concern, a health curiosity,
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:19.560]  a Colorado centric inquiry, or something more far reaching.
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:24.520]  Check out our expansive 100 question Colorado marijuana frequently asked questions first.
[02:02:24.600 --> 02:02:29.000]  If you're still curious, email your questions to the cannabis at, and then there's
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:30.920]  askthecannabis.gmail.com.
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:33.000]  If you want to participate in that, feel free.
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.200]  I get a lot of my new stuff from these guys, so participate with them if you want.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.080]  The first question got my attention.
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.400]  It says, hey cannabis, why would someone name a strain of weed after a bioweapon
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.840]  that killed thousands of people?
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.800]  They signed the letter put off pot.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:53.960]  This guy's asking, why would somebody name a strain of weed after a bioweapon that killed
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:54.680]  thousands of people?
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:58.520]  And the cannabis replies, you must be talking about Agent Orange, huh?
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:02:59.480]  I hear your concern.
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:04.200]  Strain names can mean one thing to a potential customer and something else to a plant breeder
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.320]  naming the strain.
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:10.200]  While Agent Orange is not a peaceful, happy, or euphoric name, if you view it in historical
[02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:14.760]  context, there is the other view that the name suggests an orange scent and the potency
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:15.800]  is the bomb.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.760]  An article says, I chatted with Adam Dunn, host of the Adam Dunn Show.
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:21.800]  Shout out to the Adam Dunn Show.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:22.360]  What's up, Mitch?
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.240]  What's up, Adam?
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.200]  What's up, everybody on the show?
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.240]  Crunchy, bike.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.760]  Hope you guys are all doing well.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.520]  But Adam is the founder of the Amsterdam-based seed company, TH Seeds.
[02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:35.560]  And he says, having owned a seed company myself for 21 years, I can attest that many cannabis
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:40.360]  seed companies are run by people who have a bit more of a juvenile attitude, especially
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:43.000]  when it comes to the names game, Dunn says.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:50.040]  Names like Agent Orange, AK-47, Green Crack, and Wheelchair Weed, though quite distasteful,
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:52.840]  conjure up images of something really strong and devastating.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:57.080]  I doubt the people who named Agent Orange really considered this was a bioweapon that
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.640]  killed thousands of people and destroyed lives of countless more.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:07.560]  Often, strange names are creative combinations of the names that make up the genetic lineage
[02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:09.000]  or other plant attributes.
[02:04:09.640 --> 02:04:14.840]  Adam Dunn says, having been there at the naming of AK-47 and my own MK Ultra, I am guilty
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:16.440]  of joining the hype, Dunn says.
[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.960]  I was dead wrong back in 1993 when I said AK-47 was a terrible name.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:28.120]  It was named for flowering on 47 days and AK-47 went on to become one of the most famous
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:29.320]  strains in history.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.680]  With the start of the legal adult use market this year, the reactions of consumers to strain
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:37.240]  names is a recent development in marijuana marketing.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:44.120]  Dunn points out that the cannabis industry is very young and will go through many changes.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.240]  So I am guilty of this.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.520]  This is why it got me attention.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:50.200]  I've got a strain called Bounty Killer.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:55.000]  I had a friend named Nancy tell me that she didn't really like the name and she was reluctant
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000]  to grow it because it was called Bounty Killer.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:04:59.000]  I called it Bounty Killer.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.920]  Honestly, it's named after one of my favorite reggae artists is named Bounty Killer.
[02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:07.720]  I like the way he does things and I wanted to honor him.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.080]  I've got the Cableton, which is also named after a reggae artist.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:14.840]  And I've got the Kalonji Kush, which is also named after a reggae artist.
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.640]  And the Night Nurse is named after a reggae song.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:22.520]  So the reason I called Bounty Killer Bounty Killer after the reggae artist is because
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:23.880]  it grows killer weed.
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:24.520]  It is killer.
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:28.360]  It'll kick your ass and it grows huge colas and huge harvests.
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.160]  So that's the bounty there and it's the bounty killer.
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:33.880]  So if you don't know about reggae, it sounds like you're reaping the bounty.
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:35.240]  You're killing that huge harvest.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:40.040]  Or if you know reggae, you know that it's the bounty killer and it's kind of aggressive
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:42.600]  and kind of loud and it's got a groovy beat to it.
[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.880]  And that's why I call it the bounty killer.
[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:49.160]  I wanted to talk about why I named things the way I name them and why strains I've created
[02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:49.960]  have the names they have.
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.520]  I'm a Grateful Dead fan.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.240]  I'm a Deadhead.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:54.680]  I'm kind of a...
[02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.080]  Ended like the whole spiritual side of life.
[02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:58.360]  I'm definitely a Rastafarian.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.360]  That's why my company is called Iry Genetics.
[02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:06.360]  I try to honor the parents, the parent plants that I'm using when I create a new strain.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:10.360]  But sometimes that just gets redundant and you can't be creative.
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:17.640]  So I like to draw from Rasta culture, Grateful Dead culture, and like positive, loving hippie
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:17.960]  culture.
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:20.040]  That's why I've got a strain called Heart of Gold.
[02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:23.000]  It's the golden goat crossed to the grateful dog.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:28.360]  It almost got called horn dog, but that didn't sound as good for the vibe I'm trying to promote.
[02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:29.640]  Heart of Gold.
[02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:32.520]  When you smoke that weed and you meditate, your heart is calm.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.440]  Your heart is filled with love.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.880]  What's better than a Heart of Gold, right?
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:36.760]  You got a big Heart of Gold.
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:39.480]  That's just pumping love and positive energy.
[02:06:39.480 --> 02:06:40.760]  And it's got golden goat in it.
[02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:41.720]  So it's Heart of Gold.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:47.480]  Lemon Jeffrey is golden goat crossed to the lemon skunk.
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.360]  So there's lemon, obviously the lemon, right?
[02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:57.480]  And my name is Jeff and I wanted something like you got Arjen's Hayes and there's Neville's Hayes.
[02:06:57.480 --> 02:07:00.600]  Why not have a Lemon Jeffrey that's named after me, the guy that made it.
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:03.640]  That was kind of my little stingy move on the cannabis world there.
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.600]  These guys were talking about Agent Orange.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.560]  I know who made Agent Orange.
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:08.280]  That was sub cool.
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:09.160]  It's orange velvet.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:11.320]  It's an orange velvet to Jack the Ripper cross.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:13.800]  And I think Agent Orange was a perfect name.
[02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:15.560]  And then I just said another name, Jack the Ripper.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:19.160]  It's Jack Herrera crossed to other stuff, basically.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.720]  And sub cool didn't want to use the name Jack Herrera.
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.680]  So it's Jack the Ripper.
[02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:24.680]  It's just, that's how these names come up.
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.160]  I've got a strain that I wanted to call it the golden road.
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.280]  It's a golden goat cross.
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.200]  And of course that's a Grateful Dead song.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:35.880]  So my name's come from trying to honor the parent strains.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:39.000]  And so I did get creative.
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.160]  I'm going to say this name here on the show that it's not out yet, but I've, this is my cross.
[02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:50.200]  Gorilla Glue number four crossed to the Grateful Dog is called Grip Tape.
[02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:51.480]  And that's for my skateboard friends.
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:52.920]  You know what grip tape is on your skateboard?
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:54.920]  It's that shit that makes your feet stick to the board a little bit.
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.040]  I call it grip tape because it is sticky.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.800]  It would be called fly paper, but fly paper is already taken.
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:04.280]  And grip tape kind of honors my skateboard friends.
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:05.560]  So that's where the names come from.
[02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:07.480]  We're not just spouting out random shit.
[02:08:07.480 --> 02:08:08.120]  Some guys are.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:13.160]  One of my best sellers lately has actually been a strain that's called Blue Healer.
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:15.960]  That was named by our good buddy Spence from the Garden of Whedon.
[02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:18.840]  It's actually Blue Dream crossed to the Grateful Dog.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:22.440]  So Grateful Dog gives you a dog name, the blue, Blue Healer.
[02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:25.960]  It's named after a dog to keep the Grateful Dog reference.
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:30.120]  And it's also got the word healer in there because it's going to make you feel better.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:34.200]  So it's just me trying to be silly and trying to be creative and honor the parents.
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:37.640]  And you have to name it something, you know, you can't just call it X5.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:40.600]  Maybe you can, but that would be boring, right?
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:41.640]  That's not good marketing.
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:43.160]  All right.
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.440]  So that's enough of that article.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:47.720]  I just want to just talk about how I named strains and why I named them what I named them.
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:51.000]  If you gave me like anything that I crossed to Ghost OG,
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.920]  it's going to be called ghost whatever I crossed it to.
[02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:53.480]  You know what I mean?
[02:08:53.480 --> 02:08:57.480]  Ghost dog, ghost goat, the golden ghost, you know, shit like that.
[02:08:57.480 --> 02:09:01.720]  It just, if I cross golden goat to stuff, it probably got the word gold put in there.
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:03.240]  That's just how I do it.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:04.360]  All right.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.440]  I've only been going for 32 minutes, you guys, but I don't have a lot else to say.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.760]  I honestly didn't have time to prepare for this episode.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:13.000]  I don't, I didn't want to stress out over this one.
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.720]  I wanted to hang out with you guys, take a couple dabs.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:16.440]  Let's do that.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:16.920]  Let's do that.
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:17.800]  Let's get a dab together.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:18.840]  All right, you guys take a second.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:21.800]  I'm going to ramble here while you guys get a dab together to dab with me.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.040]  I am proud because I'm going to dab shatter that I made myself.
[02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:27.000]  Oh yeah, I did that.
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.040]  I made hash and then Spence Vac purged it for me.
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:32.600]  I got it in there and got it going, but I had to leave.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.720]  So he finished it for me.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:35.560]  The stuff got purged for 35 hours.
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:37.240]  It's pretty damn dank.
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:38.360]  I hope you got a dab ready by now.
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.600]  Let's take a dab together and then we'll start wrapping up the show.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.040]  I'm going to hit the, uh, I've got the hit man E-series sidecar
[02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:49.320]  with a highly educated infinity nail on it.
[02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:55.960]  Attached to the highly educated infinity nail is the Emotech, uh, G nail.
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:09:56.920]  That's always on.
[02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:02.200]  I've got mine set to 850 right now, which people say is kind of high,
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:06.520]  but honestly, if I put any lower, I don't get a big chunky dab when I carb cap it.
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.560]  So here we go.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:08.440]  Shout out to Emotech.
[02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:09.240]  Shout out to hit man.
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:13.240]  Shout out to highly educated titanium and shout out to garden of Weeden
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:15.800]  and Angela too, since I'm doing shout outs.
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:16.120]  Here we go.
[02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:16.680]  Let's do a dab.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:27.740]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:35.430]  I like those big old chunky dabs and you're not sure if you're going to cry or cough or die.
[02:10:36.710 --> 02:10:37.190]  All right.
[02:10:37.670 --> 02:10:38.470]  So this will be fun.
[02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:42.150]  I'm going to try to do the show closing without coughing after a pretty good size dab.
[02:10:42.150 --> 02:10:43.350]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:45.830]  I promise you the next episode is going to be better.
[02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:47.910]  I hope Spence will be here, but I can't promise you.
[02:10:48.710 --> 02:10:51.590]  He'll be here before episode 50, if not on episode 50.
[02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:53.590]  Make sure you listen to episode 50.
[02:10:53.590 --> 02:10:54.550]  There are going to be prizes.
[02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.910]  Here we go.
[02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:58.390]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes, Stitcher.
[02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:01.110]  Go to the iTunes or Stitcher main page.
[02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:01.830]  I told you I was high.
[02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:05.270]  Search for iGrowCulture slash grow from your heart.
[02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:07.670]  Right now I've got both titles in there.
[02:11:07.670 --> 02:11:09.590]  It's iGrowCulture slash grow from your heart.
[02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:14.310]  Hopefully by the time episode 50 comes out, everyone will be caught on to grow from your
[02:11:14.310 --> 02:11:15.110]  heart podcast.
[02:11:15.910 --> 02:11:17.350]  So find the review section.
[02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:18.550]  Give me a five-star rating.
[02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:19.190]  Type in a comment.
[02:11:19.190 --> 02:11:22.630]  Let me know what you think of the podcast and I will read your comments on the show.
[02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:24.470]  Excuse me.
[02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:30.630]  Don't forget that every episode is available on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:11:30.630 --> 02:11:32.150]  Make sure you follow us on Twitter.
[02:11:32.710 --> 02:11:36.870]  Follow us on Facebook and follow iRegenetics on Instagram.

[02:11:39.670 --> 02:11:44.550]  I may cancel that Instagram and YouTube for the show.
[02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:45.670]  So don't be sad if they disappear.
[02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:46.710]  It's nothing personal.
[02:11:46.710 --> 02:11:48.390]  I just want to focus on more important stuff.
[02:11:48.390 --> 02:11:52.150]  So if you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast or if you have a product that
[02:11:52.150 --> 02:11:59.270]  you'd like us to review, send me an email to iGrowCulture at hotmail.com or I wrote
[02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:00.150]  the other one down.
[02:12:00.150 --> 02:12:00.630]  I made it.
[02:12:01.590 --> 02:12:05.750]  And it is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:11.110]  So email me at iGrowCulture at hotmail.com or growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[02:12:11.110 --> 02:12:12.230]  Both of those will work.
[02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:14.390]  I need a new logo, you guys.
[02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:18.150]  The grow from your heart logo would be really nice so that I can get everything in place
[02:12:18.150 --> 02:12:20.150]  and make the show new title official.
[02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:20.790]  I'm really high.
[02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:21.990]  I'm like talking in a circle.
[02:12:22.870 --> 02:12:25.270]  We do need a theme song if you guys want to help.
[02:12:26.070 --> 02:12:28.470]  Sounds like I should just end this show and sign off for now.
[02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:31.030]  I look forward to seeing you in seven days.
[02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:32.710]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:12:32.710 --> 02:12:33.910]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:36.710]  Big shout out to Angela for letting me go to the string cheese incident.
[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:39.030]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:40.070]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[02:12:58.550 --> 02:13:01.270]  If MC business was a school, then I would be a master.
[02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:04.230]  If a car had been a driver, if a bike had been a rider.
[02:13:04.230 --> 02:13:06.870]  If MC business was a church, Pato would be the picker.
[02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:09.750]  Then instead of calling me MC, you all would call me preacher.
[02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:12.550]  But fun and joke aside, I want to get serious in this matter.
[02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:15.270]  And dedicate this style to each and every cocaine dealer.
[02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:18.070]  I do not sip the coke, I only smoke sensimila.
[02:13:18.070 --> 02:13:20.870]  I do not sip the coke, I only smoke sensimila.
[02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:23.590]  Nah, I don't sip no coke, I only smoke sensimila.
[02:13:23.590 --> 02:13:26.310]  I do not sip the coke, I only smoke sensimila.
[02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:44.800]  Yeah, what's up guys?
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.760]  It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:50.640]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:50.960]  Welcome.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:52.560]  It's episode number 48.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.320]  We're creeping up on number 50.
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:57.360]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff, and I am dabbed the fuck out.
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.400]  But I've got good reason.
[02:13:58.400 --> 02:14:01.360]  We are joined today by Spence and Maddie from the Garden of Weed.
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.320]  How you guys doing over there?
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.960]  We're doing good, smoking OG.
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.080]  Damn, I'm yelling into that mic.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:06.880]  That music was loud.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.400]  I apologize for yelling at everybody.
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:08.960]  Holy shit.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.520]  Maddie, I'm going to push the mic right in your face so that we can hear you.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:12.720]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.600]  How you doing, Spence?
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:14.400]  What up?
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:14.880]  What up?
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:16.880]  I'm high.
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:18.320]  We were just smoking through the end of the OG.
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:19.600]  Oh my God.
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:21.920]  Started the podcast off a little crazy.
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.680]  Well, that's tradition over here, but I think we kind of went a little extra today.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:26.320]  Holy crap.
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:29.120]  You guys said you wanted to go hard on the dabs and we did it.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:31.840]  The first thing Maddie said when she walked into the house was, I need a dab.
[02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:33.200]  And I got one.
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:34.960]  Well, I got two so far.
[02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:36.080]  Welcome.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.680]  If you need another one, dude, there's dabs over here.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:39.040]  There's a hot, I've got the e-mail on.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:41.440]  Shout out to Giddy Up and Emotech for the g-mail.
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:42.800]  We keep it on most of the time.
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:47.200]  I was just complimenting the USB port that he installed into it.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:48.000]  Isn't that dope?
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  Charge your phone all the time while you're taking dabs.
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:52.560]  And on Instagram.
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:55.360]  And on Instagram, you charge the phone, take dabs and be on Instagram.
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:56.320]  Is that what you're doing over there?
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:14:57.840]  Pretty much.
[02:14:58.400 --> 02:14:59.760]  I got a lot of questions for you, bro.
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:00.800]  So you got to be a part of this show.
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:01.040]  That's okay.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:01.600]  You're going to wake up.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:04.640]  Maddie, you are, go ahead and drag the chair around.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:05.680]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:06.800]  Go ahead, scrape it around.
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:07.440]  There you go.
[02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.440]  You're the, ah, dude.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:11.440]  So this headphone mic is fucking up.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:14.720]  Don't ever buy the Live Wire Solutions HA04.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.600]  Don't ever buy one of those.
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.400]  It's a piece of shit.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:16.800]  Get a better product.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:17.840]  Negative shout out.
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:18.800]  Yeah, hate that piece.
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.560]  It craps out on us a lot.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.840]  So we were saying that Maddie was going to be the first female on the show.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:29.280]  Actually, that's inaccurate because I took the podcast to the Brickyard one time and we had-
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:31.040]  You made me feel special for a second.
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:32.560]  You're going to be special in just a second.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.800]  Okay, I'm going to skip bragging on the other people that were.
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:37.520]  There were other females, but you're the first female to be here on the show.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.920]  We went somewhere else and there were females there that were on the show,
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:42.400]  but you're the first lady to come be in the IRIE studio.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.120]  Home field.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:43.680]  Welcome.
[02:15:43.680 --> 02:15:44.240]  Thank you.
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:44.560]  For sure.
[02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.280]  I appreciate it.
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:46.240]  Oh, glad to have you here.
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:46.960]  It's a big accomplishment.
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:50.400]  Is Spencer the first black person on the podcast?
[02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:51.200]  Spencer's probably the first-
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.280]  I'm always the first black person in anything Jeff does.
[02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:57.120]  Yeah, he's the first black person in my house.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:58.720]  So yeah, shout out to that.
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:02.080]  Not in a bad way though, just coincidence.
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.760]  There's not any other black people around here.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:05.040]  We live in fucking Pueblo.
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:05.440]  True.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.000]  There's been a lot of white people and a lot of Mexicans here, but you know,
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:08.800]  that's just because of where we live.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:09.680]  I was supposed to say that.
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:11.200]  Oh yeah, everybody knows about Pueblo by now.
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:12.000]  You could say where we are.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.440]  These guys came in to visit me.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.720]  So dude, welcome to the show, you guys.
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:16.480]  I like having some of my best friends here.
[02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.240]  I have to do a couple of ads right quick.
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:18.960]  That's tradition.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:21.920]  You guys can laugh at me and take dabs while I do ads, however you want to do it.
[02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:25.360]  The first ad, naturesgreenremedies.com.

[02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:03.680]  Yeah, big shout out.
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:05.360]  Dude, I saw those trays you got.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:05.920]  Those are dope.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:06.960]  I think I'm going to copy you.
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:09.600]  I work there part-time now, so also come check me out.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.640]  I will be there two days a week now.
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:14.480]  You can go see Miss Whedon and stalk her.
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:15.840]  I don't know if you wanted to say that on the show.
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.640]  You might get some stalkers.
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:17.600]  No, it's okay.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:18.640]  I'm happy to help.
[02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.400]  No, I'm happy to help people.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.680]  I'm enjoying it.
[02:17:21.680 --> 02:17:23.680]  I'm learning a lot from it, actually.
[02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:24.880]  A lot more than I thought.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:27.760]  It's great to have my friends working at Hydro shops.
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:30.080]  When I go in there, you don't try to hustle me and sell me some shit.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:30.480]  For sure.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.000]  I definitely think Hygro Pueblo has the best prices in town.
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:37.680]  Actually, if you listen to the Hygro Culture or the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:38.560]  we're changing the name, you guys.
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:40.640]  I'm going to stutter and say the wrong name a few times.
[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.400]  I'll remind you about that later on in the show.
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:45.040]  If you go in there and you tell me to listen to this podcast,
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:47.840]  you will get commercial pricing on everything you buy.
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.640]  Maddie's looking at me like-
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:51.360]  Very exciting.
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:52.480]  Maddie didn't know how to do that.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:54.800]  She's going, I might have to learn how to work the cash register.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:55.520]  That's new shit.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:17:57.920]  That's all the ads.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:17:59.200]  Let's not do any more commercials.
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:02.000]  Everybody else that paid for ads, you'll get them some other time.
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:03.120]  That's cool.
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:04.400]  All right.
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:06.960]  So I got to do also a shout out to Mystic Roots for letting me play their music.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:08.240]  They let me play all of their music.
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:09.840]  They gave me full access to everything.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:10.320]  That's kind of cool.
[02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:10.880]  That's awesome.
[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.880]  Yeah, that's usually that costs a lot of money for a band.
[02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:13.840]  Shout out to them.
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.120]  Yeah.
[02:18:15.120 --> 02:18:15.600]  What was it?
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:16.640]  Shout out to Peaches.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:17.760]  Is it Peaches or Pears?
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.440]  Shout out to Pears.
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:20.480]  Shout out to Pears.
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:22.240]  Oh, Jeff is in on it.
[02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:22.480]  I know.
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:22.960]  What's up?
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:23.680]  What's up, Big Mike?
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:26.080]  I wish you were here with the crew, but someone's got to take care of the dogs.
[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:28.400]  Shout out to Sirak at Nonna.
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.280]  Scratches on the head.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:30.240]  Hey, when is this posted?
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:30.640]  Monday?
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:31.520]  Yeah, Monday morning.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:32.240]  7, 10 in the morning.
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:34.000]  I got people asking me already.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:34.960]  Nice.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:35.360]  Nice.
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:37.600]  I hope you guys are following everybody on Instagram and stuff.
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:38.640]  All right.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:40.000]  So, dude, we just took some dabs.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.600]  I want to give Spence a huge shout out on the show.
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:44.160]  Spence taught me how to make my own dabs.
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:45.040]  That's freaking awesome.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:45.680]  I appreciate it.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:46.720]  I'm self-sufficient.
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:50.640]  It's great to learn from one of who I consider the masters and also a brother.
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:51.760]  So it means a lot.
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:52.880]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:53.680]  No problem, bro.
[02:18:53.680 --> 02:18:55.840]  Well, it's about time you have great product.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:59.040]  In turn, that's going to make great oil.
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:00.240]  I appreciate that.
[02:19:00.240 --> 02:19:01.440]  I want to brag on Maddie.
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:03.360]  I want to tell a story about Maddie, introduce you guys.
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:05.440]  Maddie and Spence hang out together.
[02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:06.000]  They live together.
[02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:06.880]  That's how I met them.
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:11.520]  So one time, Spence made Earl and Maddie, she's great already.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:12.800]  She knows where I'm headed with this.
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:16.400]  She took that Pyrex dish that had a little bit of BHO left in the bottom that we didn't
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.880]  feel like scraping out, and she decided to heat it up and make brownies in that pan with
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.080]  the BHO mix in there.
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:28.640]  And she's laughing because Spence and I are on the 6'4", 6'5 level of life, close to 200
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.680]  pounds each.
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:33.760]  And there was another guy and another guy in the room that's about the same weight class,
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:37.440]  and she fucking wrecked four dudes, maybe five or six dudes.
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:41.120]  And I didn't even know that it was going to be that potent.
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:42.320]  Oh my God.
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:48.640]  The whole outer layer of the brownie was literally covered in a layer of shatter almost.
[02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:54.880]  It coated inside of the brownie, but it worked itself in perfectly to where it got us all
[02:19:54.880 --> 02:19:55.680]  so fucked up.
[02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:56.400]  You could taste it.
[02:19:56.400 --> 02:20:00.640]  It made like a, it was like a pineapple upside down cake layer of hash on the outside of
[02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:01.280]  the brownies.
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:03.440]  It was so, it was tasty, but God, I was high.
[02:20:03.440 --> 02:20:06.640]  I had to leave about 30 minutes after I left or ate that shit.
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:09.360]  I felt my arms drooping and I was like, I got to go home.
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.280]  Everybody went to bed.
[02:20:11.280 --> 02:20:12.080]  It was fun.
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:18.720]  Well, back in the day, that was the only way I could really utilize a Pyrex dish without
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:19.520]  wasting it.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:21.840]  So you said back in the day, I'm going to ask a tech question now.
[02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:22.480]  What do you do now?
[02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:31.280]  Definitely do not blast into a Pyrex dish or use a Pyrex dish in our process anymore
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:31.840]  at all.
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:38.400]  Everything's closed loop and use parchment when we process it to go through the back
[02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:38.880]  oven.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:41.280]  So there's no Pyrex dish needed now.
[02:20:41.280 --> 02:20:41.680]  Nice.
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:41.840]  Yeah.
[02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:45.120]  You guys taught me a way to do it and there's no Pyrex dish involved in how I was taught,
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.960]  which is kind of neat, kind of smooth.
[02:20:46.960 --> 02:20:48.880]  These guys are fucking bad-ass at what they do.
[02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:51.920]  So thanks for coming, you guys, by the way.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:52.240]  Welcome.
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:54.080]  Thanks for having us.
[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.680]  Spence was like, what are we going to talk about?
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:58.080]  He kind of said, let's do a year in review.
[02:20:58.080 --> 02:20:59.680]  And I thought that would be kind of cool.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:03.280]  The one thing that stood out to me too, is you got super fucking sick at the end of the
[02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:03.840]  year.
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:04.480]  Yeah.
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:06.800]  You back, you like a hundred percent or you 95?
[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.600]  I'm good.
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:08.320]  You look good, bro.
[02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:08.880]  You look good.
[02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:10.000]  I'm getting on my way back.
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:14.080]  I lost a bunch of weight and being skinny and losing a bunch of weight.
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:14.720]  Ain't really good.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:18.160]  So you looked, uh, you looked anorexic and scary skinny for a minute there.
[02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:19.040]  You had everybody worried.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:23.920]  I think we realized in 2014 health is one of the most important things that we have
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:27.200]  taking care of our bodies is really.
[02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.240]  Sorry, where it should happen on the computer here, but it's all right.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:31.120]  We're recording.
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:33.360]  Taking care of our bodies is really important.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:37.920]  And with him getting so sick now, we're trying to get him back together and get him healthy
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.600]  and gaining some more weight.
[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:43.440]  Eating properly is one thing we've kind of clicked into doing.
[02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:45.520]  I've seen you guys taking great care of yourselves.
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.880]  Going to the gym too now.
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:49.440]  Well, this will be Spencer's first time going to the gym today.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:49.940]  True.
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:56.560]  Dude, I got them long spaghetti arms and spaghetti legs.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.280]  I know how it feels.
[02:21:57.280 --> 02:21:59.280]  I don't want to go exercise in front of anybody.
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:01.280]  It's Planet Fitness though.
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:02.560]  They accept everybody.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:05.680]  Ah, so, and it's in our location, there are a lot of large people.
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:07.760]  So I'm sure you guys don't even look that silly there.
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:11.040]  I'm about to look like an Olympic athlete out there.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:13.120]  They're both like, damn, he's in the NBA.
[02:22:13.120 --> 02:22:14.400]  Yeah, well, yeah.
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:16.240]  Man, you're the only black person around here.
[02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.000]  Well, if you go by the college, but there are a lot of black folk.
[02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.040]  You should wear your grill to the gym and just go hard.
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:24.240]  Just go hard all day.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.640]  Stunned on him at the gym.
[02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:27.680]  You lost your grill?
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:29.920]  He loses his on a weekly basis.
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:30.960]  I just missed a place today.
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:31.440]  Okay.
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:33.280]  It's on a different shelf for a minute.
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.320]  It's in a different pocket.
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.200]  I'm glad you're back to health, bro.
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:42.720]  I forgot to mention Maddie grew my Girl Scout Cookies x King Kim Grape Snopper OG Cross
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:44.080]  and it looked beautiful.
[02:22:44.080 --> 02:22:46.080]  Yeah, I had two different phenos.
[02:22:46.080 --> 02:22:49.680]  I had four plants altogether, but two phenos of the same thing.
[02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.640]  And one got huge and the nodes were really far away.
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:56.640]  Totally different color.
[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:04.080]  The smaller plant, the other pheno turned purple at the end of flower, but was super frosty.
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:05.680]  The other one wasn't as frosty though.
[02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:08.480]  I thought you did a good job.
[02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.400]  I'm not sure if that thing is ever going to get to market.
[02:23:10.400 --> 02:23:13.440]  I think that might just be something that the crew around here gets to grow, but you
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.160]  did a good job with that.
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:16.320]  So shout out to the owners of that on the show.
[02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:16.960]  All right.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:20.400]  So for a year in review, both of you guys are involved in these questions.
[02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:21.360]  You can both have an answer.
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:22.080]  You can take turns.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:25.600]  What were some of your favorite strains to grow since we're all growers in the room?
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:28.560]  And I might answer on some of these questions too, since we'll do a year in review.
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.560]  Oh, let's see.
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.520]  I don't know.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:36.000]  I think at the beginning of the year, I was still stuck on the whole Girl Scout cookie
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:36.560]  thing.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:40.960]  I was anything Girl Scout cookies I was kind of running through and I still currently still
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:44.800]  have a lot of different, you know, just different unique cookie stuff.
[02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:47.040]  But I, what did I grow?
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:52.640]  I grew that Yeti OG and that kind of put me on to the OG side of, you know, things.
[02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:56.480]  So now I've been kind of trekking and trying to find different strains.
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:59.120]  Like I picked up triangle the other day, so that's a good one.
[02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:02.880]  But I'd probably say Yeti probably was my favorite plant of the year to grow.
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.360]  Wow.
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:04.400]  That's a huge compliment.
[02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:04.880]  Yeah.
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:05.440]  Shout out to Jesse.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:07.360]  I was going to say that's the one Jesse found for us.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:07.920]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.200]  And that's your favorite oil.
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:10.960]  And it's one of my favorite oils.
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:14.080]  And I was, one of my follow-up questions was going to be, do you prefer to grow different
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:16.960]  stuff for oil to, if you're going to smoke it for flour?
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:17.920]  Do you grow it for yourself?
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.000]  Do you grow a different strain and then grow different for Earl?
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:26.080]  Um, a lot of times oils just depending on what we have available.
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:26.880]  At the time.
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:31.040]  So like, if we have certain strains that we know that are better in oil than they are
[02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:32.640]  in flour, we'll make oil.
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:38.400]  And then same, like we have can of tonic right now, which we're going to split and do some
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:40.000]  oil and then some like capsules.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:41.520]  So there's a little bit of mix of.
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:42.080]  Oh yeah.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:43.040]  That's why I feel real high.
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:46.880]  They also gave me two, uh, two of those hash capsules right before we started the show.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:49.440]  And we've done a lot of, yeah, I'm going to be pretty lit.
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:50.720]  I feel it in my eyes right now.
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:52.240]  I was like, how, why am I getting heavy?
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:52.880]  And then you said that.
[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:54.480]  I was like, oh, I'm going to be pretty lit.
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:55.360]  Why am I getting heavy?
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:56.240]  And then you said that.
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:24:59.040]  So can of tonic, is that the super high CBD strain?
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.480]  Um, it's not a crazy high.
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:01.920]  It's a good ratio.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:05.440]  It's a three to one THC or CBD to THC ratio.
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:06.960]  So it's nice and great medicine.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:07.520]  Great medicine.
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:08.160]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:08.320]  Yeah.
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:10.560]  That'll make great medicine for people.
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:13.840]  Are you going to take it to, do you have a specific patient in mind or a type of patient,
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:16.560]  like an epileptic or someone with MS or something?
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:17.440]  I have a couple of people.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:20.960]  I have a couple of people who are also like cancer patients that I want to try to get
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:24.880]  some stuff to and see if, you know, just, it's not going to hurt to give it a try,
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:28.320]  especially when it's, you know, you're fighting cancer.
[02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:29.840]  You might as well try all you can.
[02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:30.320]  Hell yeah.
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:30.960]  I agree.
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:32.240]  That's cool that you guys help people out.
[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:32.720]  Oh, for sure.
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:36.160]  These guys came from North Carolina and set up shop in Colorado and they give away a lot
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:36.720]  of medicine.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:40.320]  And for people to be able to move out from out of state and do that is really cool.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.800]  Cause there are a lot of people that are really stingy with what they grow.
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:46.400]  We just love to share with other people and show people what we do.
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:46.640]  Yeah.
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:47.920]  That's why you guys are so well known.
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.360]  Cause you share and you're super kind.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:49.840]  I don't know.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.560]  I think why we moved from North Carolina is cause I wanted to, when I lived in North Carolina,
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:57.200]  I wanted to tell everybody I grew weed.
[02:25:57.200 --> 02:25:59.840]  Like it was illegal, but I was like, yo, come look at this room.
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:02.800]  Like I'd crack the door open and people would be like, what the f-
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:03.520]  What's going on?
[02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:05.760]  People think there is a UFO in our closet or something.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:06.560]  Oh hell yeah.
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:09.360]  Then now when you're here, you know, there's so many people that, you know, like you,
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:10.160]  you do the same thing.
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:12.080]  So it's like, let me see your weed.
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:12.320]  Okay.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:12.880]  Here's my weed.
[02:26:12.880 --> 02:26:13.440]  Here's my oil.
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:14.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  So it's just, you know, everything's common.
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:20.960]  One thing I do wish, I do wish the barter system was pot was a little bit better
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:24.000]  cause it would take money out of the equation.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:24.240]  Yeah.
[02:26:24.240 --> 02:26:26.480]  If I could just go to the restaurant and pay for it in an eighth.
[02:26:26.480 --> 02:26:27.920]  I know a couple of places you can do that.
[02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:31.440]  You'll have to hook me up cause we're going out to dinner one night here.
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.520]  Cause you know, Maddie, what was your, some, some of your favorite shit to grow this year?
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:37.440]  Definitely.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:41.680]  I don't know who it's from, but there was a New York city diesel Fino we had
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:45.440]  and it tastes like, and smells like red wine.
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:49.360]  And we had put it in this big circle jar and all of our friends,
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:55.280]  including me would just literally stick their faces in it for hours and just talk about it.
[02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:56.240]  It was insane.
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:59.040]  And then the oil from it was even crazier.
[02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:00.880]  It just had such a potent flavor.
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.920]  It was almost, you had to mix it with something else to kind of dial it down a little bit.
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:07.440]  And then definitely at the end of the year,
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:10.400]  one of my last favorites is a tangerine Hayes times the white.
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:10.640]  Yeah.
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:14.960]  I just found out that I have two packages of that in my little vault and that shit is going to be
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.880]  Oh, you're looking at me like, well, let's you run it and give me clones of the keeper.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:23.040]  Unfortunately, we were in the middle of a process where we didn't know what we were doing with our
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:25.600]  garden or if we were relocating.
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:30.240]  So I decided not to take clones of it, which was a huge mistake because I had a Fino that was
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:33.520]  heavier in the white and had a really good flavor to it.
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:38.400]  Um, the oil of course is amazing.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:40.320]  Tangerine oil tastes crazy.
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:40.720]  Yeah.
[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:43.280]  She gave me a couple of dabs of this tangerine oil.
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:44.880]  So I'll give you, I've got two packs of seeds.
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:46.720]  I'll give you a pack, maybe both of them.
[02:27:46.720 --> 02:27:50.240]  You run them and you find that tangerine Fino and then you give me a clone of it
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:51.360]  and then that'll be a good trade.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:52.720]  I'll take a keeper out of that shit.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:53.200]  Okay.
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:54.560]  The nice tangerine flavored one.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.120]  And then maybe I'll breed to that tangerine flavored female.
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:59.680]  I'm so glad you said that because that was definitely one of my favorite strains.
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:01.760]  That's from a down with dirt seeds.
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:02.480]  Shout out Riley.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:03.520]  That's a great strain, bro.
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:04.240]  Good selection.
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:09.440]  Usually if you breed to the white, it either comes out nothing like you don't get any flavor
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:11.120]  or you get all that dank and.
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:16.640]  I had, yeah, like I said, I had one Fino that came out a really strong white flavor and
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:21.520]  the tangerine was still there, but it was definitely a back note to it, which was nice.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:24.560]  Whatever you were giving me dabs of was delicious.
[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:24.960]  For sure.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:27.760]  I was like, y'all got some more of those dabs and you're like, bye Felicia.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:29.760]  We don't really have any left at all.
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:30.400]  And it's sad.
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:32.800]  The good dabs go away quickly.
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:36.000]  I've been trying to conserve what I made and it's hard.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.840]  I just want to dab the shit out of my dabs all day.
[02:28:37.840 --> 02:28:38.800]  We're going to have to take a dab here.
[02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:40.800]  We keep saying the D word so many times.
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:41.920]  What do you want to take a dab of?
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:42.400]  Oh shit.
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:43.600]  Got that Yeti OG over here.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:44.640]  What do you got?
[02:28:44.640 --> 02:28:48.320]  I've got a little bit of live that I got from my good friend Spence a while back.
[02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:49.440]  It's the Gorilla Haze.
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:52.320]  And then I've also got some of the Chatter that I made.
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:55.120]  That's parchment paper, y'all.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.800]  Imagine the size of parchment that it takes to make that sound, you guys, listeners.
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:00.160]  That's a pretty big rip.
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:01.200]  Yeah, that's a nice piece of...
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:03.600]  Yeah, here, you got that out.
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.160]  Give me a dab.
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.360]  I'll keep talking.
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:05.920]  There you go.
[02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:07.680]  Nicely medicated, highly educated.
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:10.720]  My next question that I want to talk about for the year,
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.240]  I might mention a couple of strains.
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:13.760]  I don't even want to talk about my own strains.
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:15.120]  I should, but that feels...
[02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.800]  The lemon Jeffrey, dude.
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:17.520]  What's your own?
[02:29:17.520 --> 02:29:18.400]  Well, something that...
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:19.840]  Did you grow anything that you...
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:21.920]  There's a few strains you grew this year that you don't...
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:24.720]  That White Widow that I got from Spence was amazing.
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:26.720]  I like the platinum.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.920]  The platinum OG is pretty killer.
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:28.640]  It was unique.
[02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:30.720]  There's some of it over there in a jar curing still.
[02:29:30.720 --> 02:29:32.880]  And I took a bunch of that to the string cheese shows.
[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:34.720]  And when I would light it, the people around me would be like...
[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:37.280]  They got a puff on that one for sure.
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:39.040]  And then the glue came around.
[02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:41.440]  I think everybody's impressed with what it does.
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:43.360]  Yeah. I want to grow that again.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:45.200]  I took cuts to grow it again a couple more times
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:47.120]  because I definitely want to put it in a bigger pot
[02:29:47.120 --> 02:29:49.600]  and give it more love, more training, more nitrogen.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.600]  Guys, if you grow the gorilla glue,
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:53.600]  feed the shit out of that plant early.
[02:29:54.240 --> 02:29:55.520]  Like, yeah, it's hungry.
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:57.040]  It wants a little bit of everything.
[02:29:57.040 --> 02:29:57.920]  Just overfeed it.
[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:00.400]  If you think you're going to fuck it up in week four, feed it more.
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:01.200]  Just feed it more.
[02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:02.400]  It should be okay.
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:03.120]  I'm going to take a dab.
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:04.080]  Somebody's got to say something.
[02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.040]  So I'll ask a question.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:08.640]  What were some of your biggest growing evolutions?
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:10.880]  And one of my favorites is Lemon Jeffery, the White Widow,
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:11.680]  and the gorilla glue.
[02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:12.720]  I guess we'll settle on those.
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:14.000]  And the Yeti, of course.
[02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:17.040]  What was some of your favorite biggest growing evolutions
[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:19.200]  that you guys made at the Garden of Weden this year?
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.320]  And I kind of know what you're going to say,
[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:22.240]  and I'm going to give a shout out to somebody after you do it.
[02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:23.760]  Oh, damn.
[02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:25.040]  I don't know what you want to say.
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:25.680]  Shit.
[02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.040]  Let's go with the cage thing.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.760]  Well, yeah, we kind of changed.
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:34.080]  Well, with stuff changing and regulation and laws and stuff like that,
[02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:35.840]  you kind of got to change with the game.
[02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.400]  So now we're kind of, instead of doing a room full of multiple plants,
[02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:45.600]  we're doing less plants, same space, but just bigger, longer veg plants.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:48.240]  So we really get to take care of a lot of, you know,
[02:30:48.240 --> 02:30:50.720]  get to spend more time with each plant,
[02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:53.440]  work on canopy management, you know, stuff like that.
[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:57.120]  So shout out to Greenworks.
[02:30:57.120 --> 02:30:58.560]  Check it out right there on my paper, bro.
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:30:59.680]  Shout out to Greenworks.
[02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.760]  Because I knew that's where this conversation was headed.
[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:07.520]  They have really set up an awesome plan for their grow.
[02:31:07.520 --> 02:31:11.040]  And a lot of people are catching on to what they're doing
[02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.840]  because with the plant count now, we have to do something.
[02:31:15.360 --> 02:31:16.800]  So bigger is better.
[02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:17.200]  Yeah.
[02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:19.920]  As a breeder, it's scary to see these plant count limitations come in.
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:21.840]  But luckily I just teamed up with the spot.
[02:31:21.840 --> 02:31:22.720]  Shout out to the spot.
[02:31:22.720 --> 02:31:24.720]  So I get to do some breeding in there.
[02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:29.760]  So are those cages pretty much your biggest evolution of growing?
[02:31:29.760 --> 02:31:30.400]  Yeah.
[02:31:30.720 --> 02:31:31.760]  We kind of learned.
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:33.120]  You did a lot of tea stuff.
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:34.160]  You advanced your teas.
[02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:35.520]  I saw the alfalfa sprouts.
[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.720]  I saw some shit like that happened.
[02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:37.360]  I did.
[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:38.320]  What did we do this year?
[02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:45.360]  We did the barley straw that has like natural barley seeds and it grows.
[02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:48.320]  We did a lot of stuff with the-
[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:49.760]  Grokashi.
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:50.480]  Grokashi.
[02:31:50.480 --> 02:31:51.200]  Like-
[02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:52.400]  That was a big hit this year.
[02:31:52.400 --> 02:31:53.840]  A lot of grokashi is a big hit.
[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:58.880]  And then just kind of going back, a lot of going back to the basics.
[02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.240]  Oh, the Govitas.
[02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:03.360]  And then everybody went to Govitas and Nanowasas, right?
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:04.160]  Hello, Govitas.
[02:32:04.160 --> 02:32:04.400]  Yeah.
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:07.040]  I've been talking about the light that Jesse gave me.
[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:08.720]  I might not even be able to run it, you guys.
[02:32:09.440 --> 02:32:12.160]  My grow room's got like a seven foot ceiling.
[02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:14.720]  I grow my plants to usually five and a half feet tall.
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:18.880]  And I've been told that you got to keep the plants three feet from those lights or you'll
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:19.280]  burn them.
[02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:20.240]  I mean-
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:20.800]  Definitely.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:22.240]  I don't know.
[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:25.200]  I don't want to say you will burn them because there's probably a couple of strains that could
[02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:27.920]  grow closer than three feet.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:31.680]  But I just think that it would definitely stress them out.
[02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:34.320]  It's just too much spectrum and too much just-
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:40.160]  Man, if you've never been under Govitas or anything like that, you know how powerful
[02:32:40.160 --> 02:32:40.480]  they are.
[02:32:40.480 --> 02:32:46.160]  At the spot they just hired me at, the spot, there's 227 Govitas and they turn on a small
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:48.800]  portion and it's like you just woke up.
[02:32:48.800 --> 02:32:49.440]  Oh, shit.
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:50.240]  Come on.
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:50.800]  He doesn't have to-
[02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:53.520]  Are they about to buy you Method 7?
[02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:54.240]  What's up, Method 7?
[02:32:54.240 --> 02:32:55.680]  If you guys are listening, I could use a sponsorship.
[02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:57.200]  Are they about to buy you at the spot?
[02:32:57.280 --> 02:33:01.680]  Yeah, they said they would, but I mean, still, if I can get them on the deal from the discount
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:02.000]  or something.
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000]  I'm trying to cop a pair wholesale.
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:07.360]  Actually, Harvest Tony, head up Harvest Tony.
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:08.000]  She'll help you out.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.080]  Sorry, Harvest Tony, I don't mean to bust you out on the show.
[02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:13.440]  Actually, I do because she's trying to be Miss High Times, so check her out.
[02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:15.040]  That's why I don't say vote for her, but check her out.
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:15.680]  Give her a good run.
[02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:17.200]  Do what you think.
[02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:18.720]  Where the fuck was I?
[02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:19.600]  Shout out to Greenworks.
[02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:20.560]  Follow those guys.
[02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:22.320]  Is it just at Greenworks on Instagram?
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:23.360]  Something like that.
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:24.560]  Maddie's going to search right quick.
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.600]  They're the guys that kind of inspired the idea for Spence's Cages.
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:30.960]  Single plant scrogs.
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:32.960]  Single plant, yeah.
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:34.960]  Single plant scrogs in gigantic containers.
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:36.720]  But did you tell them how we switched ours up?
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:38.320]  I mean, yeah, ours are...
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:40.080]  People have seen pictures.
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:40.880]  I don't have to tell people.
[02:33:40.880 --> 02:33:42.320]  Yeah, check out Garden of Weeden on Instagram.
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:44.240]  Instead of using the big squares, start using-
[02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:46.480]  Yeah, I don't want to copy my man's shit from TV.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:48.000]  We switched ours up just a little bit.
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:48.880]  It had to be a little bit different.
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:50.640]  You got to do your own OG status.
[02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:51.120]  Yeah.
[02:33:51.120 --> 02:33:52.160]  Got to do what you're doing.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.800]  Shout out to the plug on the scrogs there.
[02:33:56.560 --> 02:34:00.560]  It is green underscore works underscore.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:01.200]  Yeah, check them out on Instagram.
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:02.080]  Go check them out.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:03.840]  They have an awesome feed.
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:06.240]  Yeah, and make sure you follow Garden of Weeden.
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:07.920]  Don't follow one of the fake Garden of Weeden's.
[02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:09.280]  Look for pictures of these folks.
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:11.680]  Yeah, don't do that.
[02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:12.880]  Yeah, don't follow the bunk one.
[02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:14.960]  There's a couple of the bunk Garden of Weeden's
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.800]  and they always send me messages and shit.
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:19.360]  And I don't reply because I don't want to be a hater.
[02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:20.480]  So I just ignore it.
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:22.320]  But make sure that you find a picture of...
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:25.440]  It's Vince is a six foot, six foot four,
[02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:27.680]  six foot five black guy with a beard and dreadlocks.
[02:34:27.680 --> 02:34:29.680]  I mean, if there's not pictures of that dude on there,
[02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:30.400]  don't follow that one.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.520]  And then Maddie's a pretty lady.
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:32.400]  They're standing together.
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:33.680]  So I mean, it's easy to spot them.
[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:36.080]  They're probably hitting an expensive rig
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:39.760]  or taking too big of a dab in the picture.
[02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:41.760]  We have an expensive rig.
[02:34:41.760 --> 02:34:43.680]  At least we know we worked hard for it.
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:44.240]  Yes.
[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:45.920]  I'm just saying you guys are always at the...
[02:34:45.920 --> 02:34:46.560]  Not just your own.
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:48.480]  You guys are at all the cool events and shit.
[02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:49.440]  Yeah, we're so lucky.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.280]  We have so many friends with awesome toys
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:52.880]  that we get to play with all the time.
[02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:54.160]  Yeah, this industry is so great.
[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:56.720]  When you make friends in this community slash industry,
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.280]  you get to hit so many cool rigs and smoke so much great ash.
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:00.240]  Speaking of, where's your little...
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:00.960]  Master Shake?
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:01.460]  Yeah.
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:02.880]  He's up on the shelf.
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:03.600]  Maybe later.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.100]  Yeah.
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:06.560]  That's a good competition there.
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:08.720]  Master Shake against the rig that Spence brought over.
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:10.720]  Who made that rig you brought?
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:15.680]  I don't know his name, but it's BC Glass.
[02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:18.800]  With a Quave club in it.
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:21.200]  Yeah, with a banger on it.
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:22.560]  And this motherfucker.
[02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.920]  Yeah, that thing kicks you right in the dick and smiles.
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:26.640]  It looks at you like,
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:28.720]  you should name it Nelson.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:29.840]  Is that the guy from the Simpsons?
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:30.480]  Is that his name?
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:32.080]  They should name it Nelson because it's just like,
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:35.760]  hits you and just kicks you right in the dick and laughs.
[02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:38.480]  It's a great rig, but I'm kind of offended by the way it hit me.
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.000]  I had to look at it a second time and reconsider if I wanted to hit it again.
[02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.040]  Oh, I wanted to hit it again.
[02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:46.320]  I will hit it again, but god damn.
[02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:47.040]  Can you tap that?
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.200]  Yeah, I'll get that again.
[02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:49.840]  I ain't scared.
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:51.200]  All right.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:51.680]  Spicy?
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:55.360]  So we talked kind of about growing evolutions.
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:35:56.400]  I didn't change too much.
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:35:59.120]  I'm learning more about breeding and I learned that one of the methods I tried,
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:03.280]  I overdid it and I don't need to apply so damn much because it fucked up my plants.
[02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:07.600]  I tried to, I make my own silver thiosulfate and I applied way too many applications
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:11.520]  and I learned that if you overdo it, it just pisses the plants off and you don't get enough
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:13.200]  pollen and it sucks.
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.160]  So that's what I learned.
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.680]  That's my growing evolution.
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:17.920]  Who'd you guys notice this year other than Greenworks?
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:19.520]  Who stood out in the weed community?
[02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:24.400]  You can talk about good and or bad stuff because you covered your face like you fucking were like,
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:25.760]  well, all right.
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:28.320]  Man.
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:29.600]  Let's see.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:32.000]  I'll give a shout out to like all the people that are, you know,
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.680]  not necessarily going away from bottle nutrients, but people who are, you know,
[02:36:37.680 --> 02:36:41.280]  expanding their grow game into biologicals.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.560]  Um, I was actually just in Denver on Monday and I got to meet up with the
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.600]  micro fusion guys.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.440]  I got some bags of micro fusion for you.
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:49.760]  Nice.
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:51.360]  Shit rocks.
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:53.600]  Um, and then shout out to the mills guys.
[02:36:53.600 --> 02:36:55.520]  Um, always hooking me up when I see him.
[02:36:56.080 --> 02:36:57.600]  Mills pays the bills.
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:57.920]  Yes.
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.840]  I've never used mills.
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:00.320]  Never have.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:01.760]  Yeah.
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:02.400]  You look like you're impressed.
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:04.880]  We just started and honestly, we're really impressed so far.
[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:06.480]  Didn't you use it back in the day too one time?
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:08.960]  No, I used, what was that stuff?
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:10.480]  One of your homies used it on Instagram.
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.400]  I used to follow somebody that talked about mills.
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:15.600]  People are still talking about it.
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:17.200]  So it's doing something right.
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:22.000]  I have a friend in Seattle that started using it and she raved about it for outdoor.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.920]  Her plants were beautiful too.
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:25.520]  And she is all about mills.
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:29.280]  So when he started talking about it, well, I talked to her a lot a bit about it and she
[02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:30.320]  said that it was a good idea.
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.960]  So we went ahead and got samples.
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:37.360]  And then when we met him and we, they teamed up with micro fusion.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:37.600]  Yeah.
[02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:39.520]  Then they're doing something together now.
[02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:39.840]  Yeah.
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:44.240]  So it's biologicals and their line is now teamed up.
[02:37:44.240 --> 02:37:48.560]  So they have their whole feeding chart with the micro fusion mixed in also.
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:51.440]  So one of these days soon, we're going to make a field trip, bro.
[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:53.520]  It's going to be Spence and Jesse and myself and Maddie.
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:54.480]  You can come to, if you want.
[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:59.600]  We're going to go to the worm company in Springs, the Rocky mountain worm company and go visit
[02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.280]  Jay and stock up on some organics.
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:02.160]  Get some worms.
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:03.120]  Get some worm poop.
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:04.720]  Wow.
[02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:05.360]  What was that?
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:07.120]  Something I was about to cross somebody out.
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:12.640]  It's playing basketball in my kitchen.
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:13.040]  All right.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:17.120]  So all the, all the organic growers, like probiotics, farmers, Alliance, those types
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.280]  of guys that were, who shot, who were shotting out for who we noticed.
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:19.440]  All right.
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:19.920]  That's cool.
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.440]  Also noticed on a lot in Colorado this year, miss green thumb.
[02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:26.880]  I don't know her personally.
[02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:27.120]  Yeah.
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:29.360]  We haven't met her yet, but we haven't met her yet.
[02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:32.720]  Her and she is doing some great things.
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:32.800]  Yeah.
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:34.720]  I met Jess, a shout out Jess, miss green thumb.
[02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:36.000]  I met her one time on accident.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.960]  I bought a beer rig and I had, you know, the purple one.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:40.160]  I love it.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:43.600]  She was sitting across the table, dabbing her and I had my shirt on and she complimented
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:44.400]  it and I was like, you want to hit it?
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:44.960]  And she's like, yeah.
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:46.720]  And then she goes, you're, you're that guy.
[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:47.520]  And I was like, I am.
[02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:49.040]  Cause she recognized me from Instagram.
[02:38:49.040 --> 02:38:50.640]  So yeah, we've, yes.
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:51.120]  Awesome.
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:53.520]  Is everybody at the secret cup.
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.520]  A lot of people had ran her, her, yeah.
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:01.920]  Guys, check out miss green thumb on Instagram and check out her Kong on her feet.
[02:39:01.920 --> 02:39:02.400]  So awesome.
[02:39:02.400 --> 02:39:05.840]  When everyone's saying compliments to the grower, miss green thumb, and she got a lot
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:08.960]  of recognition for her, for her work this year.
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:10.400]  So compliments to her.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:10.800]  Yeah.
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:11.040]  Yeah.
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:14.240]  She grew arms the size of my arm, buds the size of my arms for sure.
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:14.960]  They were long.
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:15.680]  Yeah.
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:16.160]  Yeah.
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:20.960]  You and her are probably some of the, are the two best female growers that I know.
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:22.880]  That's a hell of a compliment.
[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:23.680]  I appreciate that.
[02:39:24.640 --> 02:39:25.040]  For sure.
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:27.120]  Maybe we can get her on the podcast one day.
[02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:27.440]  Yeah.
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:28.880]  I've told her she can come.
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:31.040]  I've told her so people live in Denver and shit.
[02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:33.680]  They don't want to drive down to this town to be on a podcast.
[02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:36.960]  Number one, the dangerous city in Colorado.
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:40.720]  It's probably been like fucking 10 years in a row.
[02:39:40.720 --> 02:39:46.480]  That's so frustrating though, because it's not like every day there's just violent crimes,
[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:46.640]  right?
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:48.240]  It's just because of the population.
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:51.040]  It's the people that other people are around.
[02:39:51.840 --> 02:39:52.960]  It's just the population.
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:53.680]  That's all.
[02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:54.000]  I don't know.
[02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.640]  I mind my own business and I don't have any problems.
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:39:59.600]  Do my own thing.
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:00.400]  All right.
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:04.240]  So I guess since we're talking about fucking the town and stuff that we see, here's a great
[02:40:04.240 --> 02:40:04.560]  question.
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:08.560]  After seeing, it's been a full year of legalization, like a year and five days now since we've
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:11.920]  legalized recreational adult use cannabis in the state of Colorado.
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:19.280]  I remember the moment that you could buy a weed at a store in Colorado, but after this
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:21.120]  full year, how do you feel about it and what have you seen?
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:22.880]  Does it make a difference?
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:24.560]  Yes.
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:26.080]  You guys are from a whole nother state.
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:26.720]  I don't know.
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:29.760]  It's legal.
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:31.520]  They have to regulate it.
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:38.720]  Some of the regulations are shitty, but it's stuff that has to be done.
[02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:48.000]  The whole country wants to use Colorado or Washington as an example to go legal across
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:48.320]  the board.
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:53.040]  They're going to have to be regulated like it if it wants to be everywhere.
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:55.440]  So eventually it's going to happen.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:01.280]  It sucks for small people like myself who are small business, mom and pop.
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:03.680]  We're trying to be small business and it kind of got squished.
[02:41:03.680 --> 02:41:05.840]  Always remember, go to the mom and pops.
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:12.240]  You always find better stuff there than you will the big store, for sure.
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:12.480]  Yeah.
[02:41:12.480 --> 02:41:14.000]  Check the spot first.
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:14.480]  The spot.
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:17.200]  Shout out to the spot.
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:18.880]  I got to do what I got to do.
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:22.640]  All right, Maddie, what did you notice over the last year?
[02:41:23.600 --> 02:41:27.600]  So many people from out of state are flooding into Colorado.
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.480]  I can't say anything negative about that at all.
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:32.800]  Yeah, we can't say much because we've been removed.
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:34.240]  Because I moved here two years ago.
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.040]  No, you're not being hateful.
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:35.680]  You're just noticing.
[02:41:35.680 --> 02:41:36.800]  February, two years.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:37.600]  You know what?
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:39.200]  A lot of people are from North Carolina.
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:41.360]  It's North Carolina and Texas that have moved here.
[02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:42.640]  Yeah.
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:43.760]  And also that's another thing.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:44.800]  That's just because you know us.
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:47.680]  That's the only reason North Carolina is because we are all from there.
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:48.240]  Yeah.
[02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:50.160]  And you brought the town of Dixie with you.
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:51.920]  Dixie is empty now.
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:55.840]  Just dust and fucking tumbleweeds in Dixie because y'all left.
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.360]  Truly.
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:01.200]  And all of our friends though learned how to grow amazing weed this year.
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.640]  All of our friends really caught on quickly and learned a lot from us and also yourself.
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:13.760]  And Instagram is not only a social network, a great media to learn a lot.
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:18.400]  Your guys's table at the new and the old house is part of what started me thinking about,
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:19.600]  I should do something.
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.320]  Because I would go to your place and guys at Spence and Maddie's old place and the new place,
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:28.640]  but people would fly from North Carolina and come visit these guys and just hang out for the weekend.
[02:42:28.640 --> 02:42:31.840]  And when I would show up to come dab them out and kind of maybe give them some
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:35.920]  ivory seeds and a t-shirt and some stickers for visiting and maybe a hat pin.
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:40.080]  They would start asking weed questions and no shit.
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:44.320]  10 guys came and nine of them asked the same exact first three questions.
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:47.840]  And I was like, I should just record this somewhere and play it back at him.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:51.440]  Here is my answer, like an automated weed service or some shit.
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:57.120]  But I got good at talking to people at the table and talking about growing weed like that.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:42:59.520]  And so your guys's table kind of opened this up a little bit.
[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:01.520]  And now you're here.
[02:43:01.520 --> 02:43:02.320]  So that's kind of silly.
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:09.120]  Our table is a hot topic because we're always just taking dabs and talking about different
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.160]  growing subjects.
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:12.480]  And there's always so many different people there.
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:13.840]  It's always a different conversation.
[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:14.960]  There's always something to learn.
[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:17.280]  Such a crazy mix of people.
[02:43:17.280 --> 02:43:20.960]  Black guy, white guy, Persian girl.
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:23.120]  Hey, I'm Middle Eastern.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:23.840]  Syrian.
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:24.320]  Syrian.
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:25.680]  Whatever, dude.
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:26.880]  I still got to watch out for that.
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:29.360]  I threw a dart at that part of the map and I missed.
[02:43:29.360 --> 02:43:30.800]  Tried to figure out where I was aiming for.
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:35.040]  And then there's an Asian guy from his Vietnamese dude.
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:36.960]  Then you got a couple of white dudes.
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:38.160]  Couple of chihuahuas.
[02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:39.520]  Couple of chihuahuas.
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:41.360]  People that I can't even tell what they are.
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:42.320]  I'm my wook ass.
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:43.920]  It's a nice mix of people over there.
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.160]  People just flood in when there's legal weed.
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:49.280]  Why wouldn't you?
[02:43:49.280 --> 02:43:56.720]  We come from a place where you can't have more than a gram on you without possibly going to jail.
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:01.040]  Well, you get a citation if it's under an eighth or half eighth or something like that.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:01.520]  I don't know.
[02:44:01.520 --> 02:44:02.800]  Don't quote me.
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:06.480]  But if it's more, you have the possibility of going to jail.
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:09.600]  That's still real in places.
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:11.280]  Here, I'm so free.
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:12.880]  We're going home at the end of the month.
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.280]  It's almost nerve wracking because we can't be ourselves there.
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:19.360]  We're so used to Colorado.
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.920]  Everything's so easy going and free here.
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:22.880]  I'm staying inside.
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:26.800]  Yeah, that's smart.
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:27.360]  That's smart.
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:33.840]  People forget that there's an open container law that applies to cannabis here.
[02:44:33.840 --> 02:44:37.360]  You're supposed to have your weed in a container that's sealed up and out of your reach.
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:39.760]  It's probably supposed to be in the trunk.
[02:44:39.760 --> 02:44:40.640]  Honestly, I put mine.
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:41.760]  I've got an SUV.
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:43.680]  I can reach the trunk in my car.
[02:44:43.680 --> 02:44:44.560]  I can reach everything.
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:46.240]  I'm fucking six five and I have an SUV.
[02:44:46.240 --> 02:44:47.040]  The longest arms ever.
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:48.240]  It's an unfair advantage.
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:50.320]  Yeah, so no matter where I put it.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:55.600]  I put it in the backpack in a container and my dabs are always out of reach and in the back seat.
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:57.360]  That's how I roll.
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:44:58.960]  Sometimes there may have been car dabs.
[02:45:05.730 --> 02:45:06.930]  I wanted to be a smart ass.
[02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:07.250]  It's okay.
[02:45:07.250 --> 02:45:08.050]  He can edit it.
[02:45:08.050 --> 02:45:11.890]  I wanted to be a smart ass and ask why he had to know what time it was, but none of my jokes are
[02:45:11.890 --> 02:45:12.770]  going to be appropriate.
[02:45:13.330 --> 02:45:14.690]  She's got to go to the gym.
[02:45:14.690 --> 02:45:15.490]  Get swole.
[02:45:15.490 --> 02:45:17.330]  Oh, you're going to get swole up tonight.
[02:45:17.330 --> 02:45:17.730]  Nice.
[02:45:17.730 --> 02:45:19.090]  Get blazed and then go work out.
[02:45:19.090 --> 02:45:20.530]  Shit heavier when you're high though.
[02:45:21.170 --> 02:45:23.250]  I ain't going to live too much today.
[02:45:23.250 --> 02:45:23.570]  All right.
[02:45:25.170 --> 02:45:25.730]  What are you?
[02:45:25.730 --> 02:45:27.090]  Did you know what you're going to do?
[02:45:27.090 --> 02:45:28.370]  I'm going to try to run a mile.
[02:45:30.530 --> 02:45:31.650]  About 30 minutes later.
[02:45:31.650 --> 02:45:32.210]  What are you going to do?
[02:45:32.210 --> 02:45:34.370]  Spencer quit smoking cigarettes this year.
[02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:36.050]  That's a good, good change for the year.
[02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:38.050]  Team Weeden all quit smoking cigarettes.
[02:45:38.050 --> 02:45:41.650]  Yeah, I noticed that when everybody got sick, everybody got like deathly ill at the end of
[02:45:41.650 --> 02:45:44.690]  the year and then you guys all were like fuck cigarettes and then he came back strong.
[02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:45.250]  So that's good.
[02:45:45.250 --> 02:45:46.050]  Congrats on that.
[02:45:46.050 --> 02:45:46.930]  I'm proud of you guys.
[02:45:46.930 --> 02:45:47.730]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:45:47.730 --> 02:45:49.170]  That was a big accomplishment.
[02:45:49.170 --> 02:45:53.650]  Definitely dabs taste completely different once you get your, once you get your full
[02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:54.370]  palate back.
[02:45:55.170 --> 02:45:57.010]  I still haven't gotten mine for one back.
[02:45:57.010 --> 02:45:57.890]  I don't think so.
[02:45:57.890 --> 02:45:59.890]  That means I used to smoke Newport.
[02:45:59.890 --> 02:46:02.050]  I don't know if it'll come back within two years.
[02:46:02.050 --> 02:46:03.890]  I'll shout out to Newport running.
[02:46:03.890 --> 02:46:07.010]  They got me through some years through some stressful times.
[02:46:07.810 --> 02:46:09.010]  My life is hard.
[02:46:10.690 --> 02:46:10.930]  Yeah.
[02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:12.930]  The only black person in this town and shit.
[02:46:13.730 --> 02:46:14.610]  Shit is hard.
[02:46:15.170 --> 02:46:16.930]  You know what we didn't see after legalization?
[02:46:17.650 --> 02:46:21.010]  A whole bunch of crime, a whole bunch of murder, a whole bunch of rape, a whole bunch of little
[02:46:21.010 --> 02:46:24.450]  kids running around smoking spliffs, a whole bunch of people walking in the park, just
[02:46:24.450 --> 02:46:25.010]  getting high.
[02:46:25.890 --> 02:46:27.330]  Everyone's happy.
[02:46:27.330 --> 02:46:27.650]  Yeah.
[02:46:28.770 --> 02:46:29.010]  Yeah.
[02:46:29.010 --> 02:46:30.130]  Cause yeah.
[02:46:30.130 --> 02:46:32.850]  What is there to fight over when it's legal?
[02:46:33.730 --> 02:46:36.290]  It is, it's like the no brainer.
[02:46:36.290 --> 02:46:39.090]  I just don't understand why other States don't follow.
[02:46:39.730 --> 02:46:40.210]  Hear that?
[02:46:40.850 --> 02:46:42.450]  Maddie's got a point guys.
[02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:45.170]  If you're in another state, if I can legalize weed there, what the hell?
[02:46:45.890 --> 02:46:48.450]  Legalize cannabis around the country would make things so much easier.
[02:46:48.450 --> 02:46:52.210]  Crime and have less people in jail for pointless crimes.
[02:46:52.210 --> 02:46:56.290]  And make some money off of cannabis taxes because the state of Colorado makes a shit
[02:46:56.290 --> 02:46:56.530]  ton.
[02:46:56.530 --> 02:46:58.930]  I could Google it, but that'll give me, give me sidetracked.
[02:46:58.930 --> 02:47:01.250]  They make a whole shit ton of money off.
[02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:03.730]  They just released everything since it's 2015.
[02:47:03.730 --> 02:47:04.210]  They released.
[02:47:04.210 --> 02:47:04.690]  Yeah.
[02:47:04.690 --> 02:47:07.410]  I'll probably try to do that on episode 49 or 50.
[02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:08.370]  We'll talk about those numbers.
[02:47:08.370 --> 02:47:09.570]  I'll get Mike here.
[02:47:09.570 --> 02:47:10.930]  Mike's good with numbers.
[02:47:10.930 --> 02:47:12.610]  It'll make it sound eloquent.
[02:47:12.610 --> 02:47:13.330]  I would like to know.
[02:47:13.330 --> 02:47:14.530]  Shout out to Mike.
[02:47:14.530 --> 02:47:15.010]  What's up, Mike?
[02:47:15.010 --> 02:47:15.890]  You've been working hard, bro.
[02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:18.210]  What's up, Adam, Jesse, that whole crew, Tony.
[02:47:18.210 --> 02:47:19.650]  Uh, they all been working their asses off.
[02:47:20.370 --> 02:47:21.170]  Uh, proud of them.
[02:47:21.170 --> 02:47:22.290]  They're getting some shit done.
[02:47:22.930 --> 02:47:24.290]  Uh, what am I supposed to say?
[02:47:24.290 --> 02:47:26.530]  Uh, fish cut faster.
[02:47:26.530 --> 02:47:28.050]  I think that's what I'm supposed to say.
[02:47:28.050 --> 02:47:28.290]  Yeah.
[02:47:28.290 --> 02:47:29.970]  They listened to the podcast at the work site.
[02:47:29.970 --> 02:47:31.410]  Fish do something, bro.
[02:47:31.410 --> 02:47:32.690]  Fucking do something.
[02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:33.410]  Come on, man.
[02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:34.850]  You can play Xbox later, brother.
[02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:35.570]  Come on, man.
[02:47:36.770 --> 02:47:37.250]  All right.
[02:47:37.250 --> 02:47:40.530]  So full year of legalization and nobody's been fucking raped and killed.
[02:47:40.690 --> 02:47:41.410]  Kids with joints.
[02:47:41.410 --> 02:47:42.690]  What's my next question?
[02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:43.810]  Oh, the garden of Weeden, bro.
[02:47:43.810 --> 02:47:45.410]  You guys won a bunch of awards this year.
[02:47:45.970 --> 02:47:49.090]  Um, what are some of your proudest achievements?
[02:47:50.690 --> 02:47:51.970]  Sorry, I just got deep on you.
[02:47:52.770 --> 02:47:56.370]  We had to go through a lot of hardships this year.
[02:47:56.370 --> 02:48:02.370]  So definitely getting our win for secret cup mountain was awesome for us.
[02:48:02.370 --> 02:48:08.850]  Pulling everything together and getting our entry right and perfecting live resin or not.
[02:48:08.850 --> 02:48:14.050]  I don't know if you'd consider it perfecting, but working on, we just got really good at it.
[02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:20.050]  You guys are part of the pioneering process of libraries trying to perfect libraries and
[02:48:20.050 --> 02:48:21.730]  shit, but I haven't had what I call perfect.
[02:48:21.730 --> 02:48:23.170]  I don't know what else you're going to do.
[02:48:23.170 --> 02:48:24.210]  Shit's good enough.
[02:48:24.210 --> 02:48:24.770]  All right.
[02:48:24.770 --> 02:48:25.170]  Damn.
[02:48:25.970 --> 02:48:29.890]  Yeah, it was so awesome to win the secret cup because we were with all of our friends
[02:48:30.530 --> 02:48:33.170]  and it was an awesome competition.
[02:48:33.170 --> 02:48:38.290]  It's pretty fair in my opinion, because you have for, if anybody doesn't know, you have a box with,
[02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:39.810]  how many entries were there this year?
[02:48:39.810 --> 02:48:42.050]  I think there were 32, maybe 30 something.
[02:48:42.050 --> 02:48:43.090]  It's just cool.
[02:48:43.090 --> 02:48:47.010]  Cause you know, you get to compete with, especially Colorado, Colorado's like.
[02:48:48.930 --> 02:48:52.210]  The first place to do weed stuff.
[02:48:52.210 --> 02:48:52.770]  Yeah.
[02:48:52.770 --> 02:48:55.890]  So like now you got, it's supposed to be like the Mecca of oil makers.
[02:48:55.890 --> 02:49:01.170]  So it's cool to try to win that, you know, or win it for Colorado and compete against
[02:49:01.170 --> 02:49:06.370]  people, you know, who, cause she can't, it just won the Amsterdam cup with the Kong.
[02:49:06.930 --> 02:49:10.930]  But when I was standing there, I was standing next to my girl and they're like,
[02:49:10.930 --> 02:49:14.210]  when Big D announced it, he goes like, you all know who won first place.
[02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:15.410]  Or you already know who it is.
[02:49:15.410 --> 02:49:16.770]  And I was like, well, I don't know.
[02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:17.490]  I feel dumb.
[02:49:17.490 --> 02:49:22.050]  Cause I was like, well, I don't like, I was like, well, then that made me think, well,
[02:49:22.050 --> 02:49:23.170]  obviously it's not Spence.
[02:49:23.170 --> 02:49:26.370]  Cause it's something that would be, it's like going to be one of those popular guys.
[02:49:26.370 --> 02:49:29.250]  It's got stickers everywhere and fucking everyone knows him and they were all high
[02:49:29.250 --> 02:49:30.770]  fiving him as he walked in.
[02:49:30.770 --> 02:49:35.330]  And I was like, I didn't fucking see bomb anywhere, but then he's like fucking garden
[02:49:35.330 --> 02:49:35.810]  of Wieden.
[02:49:35.810 --> 02:49:39.010]  And I was, I, all I could say was, holy shit.
[02:49:39.010 --> 02:49:42.930]  And I just looked at my girl, like, dude, but really do we know them?
[02:49:42.930 --> 02:49:46.290]  Like, and you guys walked up to the front and she's like, shouldn't you go up there?
[02:49:46.290 --> 02:49:50.050]  And I was like, let my homie have his minute for a minute, like let him do his thing.
[02:49:50.050 --> 02:49:53.090]  And then everyone in the crowds are going to be like, dude, they moved out of my way
[02:49:53.090 --> 02:49:54.930]  so that I could walk up towards you guys and shit.
[02:49:54.930 --> 02:49:55.810]  And I was like, oh, okay.
[02:49:55.810 --> 02:49:56.850]  I'll just go hang out.
[02:49:56.850 --> 02:49:58.050]  I was so shocked.
[02:49:58.050 --> 02:50:00.610]  I had, I had no idea we were going to win.
[02:50:00.610 --> 02:50:04.610]  When they called three and two, I was like, fuck, we have lost.
[02:50:05.890 --> 02:50:08.050]  Me and Maddie were literally standing right next to each other.
[02:50:08.050 --> 02:50:14.130]  And they did like all like the lower, the next, the bottom awards, not bottom, but like
[02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:17.170]  yeah, all that.
[02:50:17.170 --> 02:50:18.370]  And we didn't win none of that.
[02:50:18.370 --> 02:50:19.250]  And I was like, shit.
[02:50:19.970 --> 02:50:21.250]  And then they did third place.
[02:50:21.250 --> 02:50:23.490]  And it was, who was third place?
[02:50:23.490 --> 02:50:24.210]  Kind Bill.
[02:50:24.210 --> 02:50:25.330]  Kind Bill was third place.
[02:50:25.330 --> 02:50:26.770]  And I was like, oh shit.
[02:50:27.570 --> 02:50:30.450]  And then second place was a cushy candy.
[02:50:30.450 --> 02:50:31.330]  And then I looked at Maddie.
[02:50:31.330 --> 02:50:32.770]  I was like, we ain't winning.
[02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:35.410]  And then he, he went through that whole round.
[02:50:35.410 --> 02:50:38.690]  When I was like, damn, it was tight.
[02:50:38.690 --> 02:50:39.010]  It was cool.
[02:50:39.010 --> 02:50:40.210]  The look on your face was great.
[02:50:40.210 --> 02:50:42.130]  It was, you guys were kind of in shock for a minute.
[02:50:42.130 --> 02:50:43.410]  I think Maddie was so shocked.
[02:50:43.410 --> 02:50:44.690]  He didn't even know what to say.
[02:50:44.690 --> 02:50:47.330]  So he just had to, you know, his speech was great though.
[02:50:47.330 --> 02:50:47.730]  Yeah.
[02:50:47.730 --> 02:50:48.450]  Perfect.
[02:50:48.450 --> 02:50:48.770]  Yeah.
[02:50:48.770 --> 02:50:50.050]  It's something about running from here.
[02:50:50.050 --> 02:50:51.090]  So this is fucking cool.
[02:50:51.090 --> 02:50:53.090]  Like I moved here to do this and I did this.
[02:50:53.650 --> 02:50:57.570]  The best part about it is we had all of our friends pretty much from North Carolina.
[02:50:57.570 --> 02:50:59.010]  We're at the event with us.
[02:50:59.090 --> 02:51:02.770]  So the best thing is to win with the people beside you that you started with.
[02:51:03.490 --> 02:51:06.850]  A lot of people thought that I grew that material and I had to correct a lot of them
[02:51:06.850 --> 02:51:09.010]  because Spence was wearing his Irie genetics hoodie.
[02:51:09.010 --> 02:51:09.890]  And so was Maddie.
[02:51:09.890 --> 02:51:11.490]  I just rocked that shit all the time.
[02:51:11.490 --> 02:51:11.890]  I rocked it.
[02:51:11.890 --> 02:51:12.850]  They're so comfy, bro.
[02:51:12.850 --> 02:51:13.810]  Those are some great hoodies.
[02:51:13.810 --> 02:51:14.130]  Perfect.
[02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:15.010]  The logo is awesome.
[02:51:15.010 --> 02:51:16.290]  Mine's in the washer right now though.
[02:51:16.290 --> 02:51:16.850]  Getting cleaned.
[02:51:16.850 --> 02:51:20.210]  I got two of them because I got a, I got the dog hair situation going on.
[02:51:20.930 --> 02:51:22.610]  Shout out to all the dogs.
[02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:26.610]  What's up, Jerry boy.
[02:51:26.610 --> 02:51:27.330]  Are you listening?
[02:51:27.890 --> 02:51:28.210]  Maybe.
[02:51:28.770 --> 02:51:29.570]  Stella, are you there?
[02:51:30.850 --> 02:51:31.890]  Shout out to all the dogs.
[02:51:32.690 --> 02:51:33.890]  Uh, where was I?
[02:51:33.890 --> 02:51:34.370]  Oh yeah.
[02:51:34.370 --> 02:51:35.410]  Proudest achievements.
[02:51:35.410 --> 02:51:37.490]  So yeah, winning that secret cup, dude, that was fun.
[02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:38.370]  I was there with you.
[02:51:38.370 --> 02:51:40.930]  What's the other stuff you guys keep winning on Thursday nights?
[02:51:40.930 --> 02:51:43.090]  We won a top shelf Thursday in Denver.
[02:51:43.970 --> 02:51:48.290]  Um, it's at a, there's a social, there's like, there's multiple social clubs in Denver too.
[02:51:48.290 --> 02:51:51.970]  So if you're ever bored and you want to go smoke somewhere, just drive to Denver and
[02:51:51.970 --> 02:51:53.810]  Google social smoke club.
[02:51:53.810 --> 02:51:55.570]  This one particular is an Aurora.
[02:51:55.570 --> 02:51:57.570]  And this one's an Aurora off of Colfax.
[02:51:57.570 --> 02:52:01.250]  It's called seven, 10 social lounge therapy.
[02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:01.970]  Either one.
[02:52:01.970 --> 02:52:02.210]  Okay.
[02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:05.410]  I'm going to try to remember those, but you can pay like a member price.
[02:52:05.410 --> 02:52:09.650]  They pay like 25 bucks and you can go in there for anytime you want for a month and smoking.
[02:52:09.650 --> 02:52:10.370]  It's good to know.
[02:52:10.370 --> 02:52:10.850]  It's nice.
[02:52:10.850 --> 02:52:11.410]  It's really nice.
[02:52:11.410 --> 02:52:12.850]  And they've done last month.
[02:52:12.850 --> 02:52:14.610]  They did our last time.
[02:52:14.610 --> 02:52:20.130]  They did a 16 person bracket and then it broke all the way down to the finals.
[02:52:20.130 --> 02:52:21.250]  And then I won the finals.
[02:52:21.810 --> 02:52:24.370]  Um, got a free rig, got a bunch of stuff like that.
[02:52:24.370 --> 02:52:27.250]  Now they're doing another round and now it's 32 people.
[02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:32.530]  So it's a bigger bracket and they wanted me to do it, but I was just, I want to focus
[02:52:32.530 --> 02:52:33.970]  more on growing weed this year.
[02:52:33.970 --> 02:52:34.690]  There you go.
[02:52:34.690 --> 02:52:39.650]  And I still make oil, but I want to focus on making sure my weeds at where it should
[02:52:39.650 --> 02:52:41.090]  be at before I even make oil.
[02:52:41.090 --> 02:52:44.450]  And see, that's why I wasn't even making oil before I wanted to breed and make sure that
[02:52:44.450 --> 02:52:45.170]  shit was on point.
[02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:47.650]  Like do that and let you hash makers make my hash.
[02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:48.450]  It was working well.
[02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:50.370]  But it was a lot of fun making hash.
[02:52:52.130 --> 02:52:52.610]  Go ahead.
[02:52:52.610 --> 02:52:54.530]  Oh, one thing with all these competitions this year.
[02:52:55.250 --> 02:53:01.250]  We met a lot of amazing people in Denver specifically because when we used to go to
[02:53:01.250 --> 02:53:03.570]  Denver, we used to not really know that many people.
[02:53:03.570 --> 02:53:06.850]  And then when we started going to the social club, we kind of connected with a lot of other
[02:53:06.850 --> 02:53:07.250]  people.
[02:53:07.250 --> 02:53:12.850]  So if you are new to Colorado, that's a good opportunity to meet a lot of other fellow
[02:53:12.850 --> 02:53:13.410]  dabbers.
[02:53:13.410 --> 02:53:18.690]  Even if you're just somebody that's in the seven, 10 or four 20 community and you're
[02:53:18.690 --> 02:53:22.450]  from Colorado and you want other people to smoke with like feel free for sure.
[02:53:23.410 --> 02:53:26.210]  Find us at like, I'll be at the cannabis cup for sure.
[02:53:26.210 --> 02:53:28.850]  I don't really rep the high times events, but I'll be there.
[02:53:28.850 --> 02:53:30.370]  It's the high times cannabis cup.
[02:53:30.370 --> 02:53:31.730]  It's April 19th.
[02:53:31.730 --> 02:53:33.650]  It's like the 18th, 19th, 20th.
[02:53:33.650 --> 02:53:33.810]  Yeah.
[02:53:33.810 --> 02:53:35.250]  It's three days this year.
[02:53:35.250 --> 02:53:37.490]  It's got a lot of dope ass events planned out.
[02:53:37.490 --> 02:53:38.050]  I'll be there.
[02:53:38.050 --> 02:53:39.090]  I will not have a booth.
[02:53:39.090 --> 02:53:39.890]  I was offered a booth.
[02:53:39.890 --> 02:53:40.530]  I declined.
[02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:43.330]  I'd rather roam around and do a task rock style.
[02:53:43.330 --> 02:53:45.010]  Just take my backpack and do what I can.
[02:53:46.370 --> 02:53:47.410]  Yeah, it'll go quickly.
[02:53:47.410 --> 02:53:47.810]  I'm sure.
[02:53:48.370 --> 02:53:49.410]  But it's more fun that way.
[02:53:49.410 --> 02:53:51.170]  I don't, I feel tied down when I have a booth.
[02:53:51.170 --> 02:53:55.010]  I can walk around and go see who I want to and then get the fuck out when I'm ready.
[02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:57.090]  And then actually enjoy it.
[02:53:57.090 --> 02:53:57.490]  Yeah.
[02:53:57.490 --> 02:53:58.050]  Yeah.
[02:53:58.050 --> 02:53:59.410]  I'll get a booth in a couple of years.
[02:53:59.410 --> 02:54:00.290]  I'm just not ready for that.
[02:54:00.290 --> 02:54:02.370]  I don't want to invest into that and be tied down.
[02:54:02.370 --> 02:54:05.570]  I need to have some employees that'll run the booth the whole time for me.
[02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:06.770]  That's what I want before I'm there.
[02:54:06.770 --> 02:54:07.250]  Sure.
[02:54:07.250 --> 02:54:07.730]  Yeah.
[02:54:07.730 --> 02:54:08.530]  I'm not ready for that.
[02:54:09.170 --> 02:54:13.170]  So if you're looking forward to me having a booth at the cup, I apologize, but I'm really
[02:54:13.170 --> 02:54:16.370]  tall and really white and I got really long dreadlocks and I'm wearing an Irie genetics
[02:54:16.370 --> 02:54:18.610]  t-shirt and or hoodie and I got a backpack.
[02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:19.410]  You ain't gonna miss it.
[02:54:19.410 --> 02:54:19.650]  Yeah.
[02:54:19.650 --> 02:54:20.930]  I'm easy to spot.
[02:54:20.930 --> 02:54:22.210]  We're easy to find.
[02:54:22.210 --> 02:54:22.610]  All right.
[02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:24.210]  So what's next for the garden of Weeden, you guys?
[02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:27.170]  Oh, I don't mean like the gym after this.
[02:54:27.170 --> 02:54:28.850]  I mean, you know, 2015.
[02:54:29.890 --> 02:54:35.970]  Spencer just said focus on growing and get back to the basics and really work.
[02:54:35.970 --> 02:54:39.890]  Well, particularly lately, we've been working on our veg, just getting our veg.
[02:54:39.890 --> 02:54:40.930]  Absolutely.
[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:41.650]  Perfect.
[02:54:41.650 --> 02:54:42.450]  Nice.
[02:54:42.450 --> 02:54:47.250]  And just making sure all of our stuff is top of the line, getting all of our equipment
[02:54:47.250 --> 02:54:47.890]  in check.
[02:54:49.330 --> 02:54:50.210]  We just.
[02:54:50.290 --> 02:54:52.690]  For you new growers, did you hear what Maddie just said?
[02:54:52.690 --> 02:54:53.810]  Pay attention to the veg.
[02:54:53.810 --> 02:54:55.650]  You guys don't pay enough attention to veg.
[02:54:55.650 --> 02:54:56.850]  I'm not scolding any of you.
[02:54:56.850 --> 02:54:58.930]  I'm just saying a lot of people don't pay enough attention.
[02:54:58.930 --> 02:55:00.290]  Not you specifically, not you.
[02:55:00.290 --> 02:55:00.770]  Sorry.
[02:55:00.770 --> 02:55:02.530]  You guys don't pay enough attention to veg.
[02:55:02.530 --> 02:55:03.650]  You could, you could pay more.
[02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:04.050]  I'm sure.
[02:55:04.850 --> 02:55:07.970]  Love that bedroom as much as you love the flower room because that's where it all starts.
[02:55:07.970 --> 02:55:09.730]  Healthy children make healthy adults.
[02:55:09.730 --> 02:55:10.530]  If you neglect your kids.
[02:55:10.530 --> 02:55:15.250]  You can't expect your flower plants to be amazing when you have a shitty veg.
[02:55:15.810 --> 02:55:22.770]  And sometimes even us, we sometimes start to get so caught up in our flower room that,
[02:55:22.770 --> 02:55:24.930]  like I said, our veg started falling behind a little bit.
[02:55:24.930 --> 02:55:30.210]  So we're going to work on just making sure all of our garden is in check.
[02:55:30.210 --> 02:55:31.010]  In check.
[02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:31.970]  You guys have a nice team.
[02:55:33.090 --> 02:55:34.370]  I like how you guys can handle shit.
[02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:35.170]  I've seen it happen.
[02:55:35.170 --> 02:55:36.210]  You're like, we got to do something.
[02:55:36.210 --> 02:55:38.770]  Well, squad stands up and it happens, bro.
[02:55:38.770 --> 02:55:39.250]  It's awesome.
[02:55:40.050 --> 02:55:41.490]  So fucking awesome to see it happen.
[02:55:41.490 --> 02:55:43.890]  We have a big Mike and he's our other part of.
[02:55:43.890 --> 02:55:44.850]  Shout out to big Mike.
[02:55:45.490 --> 02:55:46.210]  Bigger Mike.
[02:55:47.490 --> 02:55:49.650]  Call me big Mike 9 1 9 on Instagram.
[02:55:49.650 --> 02:55:50.050]  Check them out.
[02:55:50.050 --> 02:55:51.250]  That's one of our good homies.
[02:55:51.250 --> 02:55:53.330]  AKA Barack Oganja.
[02:55:53.330 --> 02:55:54.130]  That's him.
[02:55:54.130 --> 02:55:54.850]  That's him.
[02:55:54.850 --> 02:55:56.370]  It's a rock and Nana's bodyguard.
[02:55:58.050 --> 02:55:58.610]  What's up, Mike?
[02:55:58.610 --> 02:56:01.570]  You can come be on the podcast whenever you want, bro, but we're going to give you big dabs.
[02:56:01.570 --> 02:56:04.050]  Mike isn't into the giant dab thing like we are over here.
[02:56:04.930 --> 02:56:05.890]  Glob squad.
[02:56:05.890 --> 02:56:07.250]  Glob squad.
[02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:08.370]  What's up, sloppy?
[02:56:08.370 --> 02:56:08.850]  Love you, bro.
[02:56:08.850 --> 02:56:10.450]  Haven't heard from you in a little while.
[02:56:10.450 --> 02:56:11.650]  I don't have your new phone number.
[02:56:11.650 --> 02:56:12.770]  That's my excuse.
[02:56:12.770 --> 02:56:14.930]  And I really don't because I'm texting the old phone number.
[02:56:14.930 --> 02:56:16.370]  Apparently, I didn't know you had a new number.
[02:56:16.930 --> 02:56:17.430]  Oops.
[02:56:18.450 --> 02:56:21.410]  I wonder who I'm texting because they shouldn't get those messages.
[02:56:22.210 --> 02:56:23.010]  Probably nobody.
[02:56:24.130 --> 02:56:24.850]  A dead phone.
[02:56:24.850 --> 02:56:25.350]  Oopsie.
[02:56:26.370 --> 02:56:27.490]  You guys got anything left for the show?
[02:56:27.490 --> 02:56:29.010]  We've been going like 45 minutes.
[02:56:29.010 --> 02:56:29.570]  We should start.
[02:56:29.570 --> 02:56:30.370]  In the garden.
[02:56:30.370 --> 02:56:31.330]  You want to do that part?
[02:56:32.610 --> 02:56:33.810]  I'll go find that on YouTube.
[02:56:33.810 --> 02:56:34.450]  I think I got it.
[02:56:34.450 --> 02:56:34.950]  Save it.
[02:56:35.810 --> 02:56:37.090]  Spence is thinking.
[02:56:37.090 --> 02:56:37.970]  Don't think too hard, bro.
[02:56:37.970 --> 02:56:38.850]  It's just a podcast.
[02:56:38.850 --> 02:56:44.690]  I have just put the seeds that I germinated of the Lemon Jeffrey Times cross.
[02:56:46.210 --> 02:56:47.810]  I hate when I say that.
[02:56:47.810 --> 02:56:48.930]  So you want to have that conversation?
[02:56:48.930 --> 02:56:49.650]  I hate when I say that.
[02:56:49.650 --> 02:56:50.130]  What do you guys think?
[02:56:50.770 --> 02:56:51.330]  Lemon Jay.
[02:56:53.170 --> 02:56:53.490]  King Kim.
[02:56:53.490 --> 02:56:54.770]  KCGS.
[02:56:54.770 --> 02:56:55.270]  Oh, nice.
[02:56:55.810 --> 02:56:56.610]  Nice.
[02:56:56.610 --> 02:56:57.570]  So when you guys are...
[02:56:57.570 --> 02:56:58.050]  When we're talking...
[02:56:58.050 --> 02:56:59.490]  This is just random side talk.
[02:56:59.490 --> 02:57:02.290]  When we're talking about strains, a lot of times people...
[02:57:02.290 --> 02:57:06.450]  And I tried to avoid it also, but so many people said it that I got sucked into it.
[02:57:06.450 --> 02:57:11.810]  A lot of people will say the Lemon Jeff Times, the Grateful Dog.
[02:57:12.690 --> 02:57:14.210]  I like to say crossed too.
[02:57:15.010 --> 02:57:15.970]  But so what do you guys think?
[02:57:15.970 --> 02:57:16.850]  Tweet me that.
[02:57:16.850 --> 02:57:19.730]  It's at I Grow Culture, which I wish I could change that, but I can't.
[02:57:20.850 --> 02:57:24.050]  The show name is different and I don't want to lose all my Twitter followers.
[02:57:24.050 --> 02:57:24.610]  I'll think about it.
[02:57:24.610 --> 02:57:25.810]  We'll see what we could do.
[02:57:25.810 --> 02:57:29.010]  Just make a new one and then add the link to that one and that one.
[02:57:29.010 --> 02:57:29.490]  All right.
[02:57:29.490 --> 02:57:30.450]  And just double click it.
[02:57:30.450 --> 02:57:31.090]  I might have to do it.
[02:57:31.090 --> 02:57:31.810]  I'm going to write it down.
[02:57:31.810 --> 02:57:32.370]  New Twitter.
[02:57:33.810 --> 02:57:34.770]  But tell me what you think.
[02:57:34.770 --> 02:57:35.730]  How should we say that?
[02:57:35.970 --> 02:57:37.010]  What does that X mean?
[02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:37.810]  Because it's not math.
[02:57:37.810 --> 02:57:39.410]  It doesn't mean times.
[02:57:39.410 --> 02:57:39.890]  Yeah.
[02:57:39.890 --> 02:57:44.210]  Personally, when I just said it, it's a pet peeve of mine.
[02:57:44.210 --> 02:57:47.170]  Two times two would make the four.
[02:57:48.050 --> 02:57:50.930]  If two boned two, it would have four was what would come out.
[02:57:52.450 --> 02:57:54.210]  Still though, I just don't...
[02:57:54.210 --> 02:57:55.810]  I mean, it technically could be right.
[02:57:55.810 --> 02:57:59.890]  Me personally, I just think when it comes out of my mouth, it just does not sound right.
[02:57:59.890 --> 02:58:00.850]  Because we're not doing math.
[02:58:02.210 --> 02:58:02.530]  All right.
[02:58:02.530 --> 02:58:04.130]  So let's start something new.
[02:58:04.130 --> 02:58:04.370]  Yeah.
[02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:04.930]  What's a new one?
[02:58:05.570 --> 02:58:08.930]  If you come up with something in the next three seconds, I'll give you the opportunity to create.
[02:58:08.930 --> 02:58:11.490]  Tweet if you can think of something better.
[02:58:11.490 --> 02:58:13.010]  No, we're putting you on the spot.
[02:58:13.010 --> 02:58:13.330]  Me?
[02:58:13.330 --> 02:58:13.970]  Yeah, you.
[02:58:13.970 --> 02:58:14.850]  I have to think of something?
[02:58:14.850 --> 02:58:15.250]  Yeah, come on.
[02:58:15.250 --> 02:58:18.130]  Oh, well, can I get like phone a friend or something?
[02:58:18.130 --> 02:58:19.330]  I don't know right now.
[02:58:19.330 --> 02:58:19.410]  You can take a dab.
[02:58:19.410 --> 02:58:20.610]  You can take a dab live.
[02:58:20.610 --> 02:58:21.970]  That's how long you get to think it through.
[02:58:22.930 --> 02:58:24.850]  I'll try to get this dab of live resin for you.
[02:58:26.370 --> 02:58:27.090]  Man.
[02:58:27.090 --> 02:58:29.250]  One time I'm going to have you come on the show until the whole process.
[02:58:31.810 --> 02:58:32.690]  I can't afford that.
[02:58:32.690 --> 02:58:33.170]  That shit costs money.
[02:58:33.170 --> 02:58:34.450]  I got to pay money for that shit.
[02:58:35.570 --> 02:58:37.650]  You just beatbox it.
[02:58:37.650 --> 02:58:39.090]  You ain't going to pay money for that.
[02:58:39.090 --> 02:58:39.490]  Right.
[02:58:39.490 --> 02:58:40.130]  I may have to.
[02:58:40.130 --> 02:58:41.170]  That's why I was cutting her off.
[02:58:42.370 --> 02:58:43.250]  Turn it over her.
[02:58:43.250 --> 02:58:44.930]  You can just do an F for fuck.
[02:58:46.530 --> 02:58:47.410]  Yeah, we said that.
[02:58:47.410 --> 02:58:48.370]  That one was cool.
[02:58:48.370 --> 02:58:49.810]  Yeah, but just to not.
[02:58:49.810 --> 02:58:50.850]  Yeah, we're not going to be all.
[02:58:50.850 --> 02:58:51.970]  It doesn't beat times.
[02:58:51.970 --> 02:58:53.250]  I can't think of anything.
[02:58:53.250 --> 02:58:54.930]  The lemon Jeff, fuck the grateful dog.
[02:58:54.930 --> 02:58:57.730]  I can't say that when I talk like at the cannabis cup to people.
[02:58:57.730 --> 02:58:59.250]  They were going to be offended.
[02:58:59.250 --> 02:59:00.610]  Some people might like it.
[02:59:00.610 --> 02:59:00.850]  Yes.
[02:59:01.730 --> 02:59:05.570]  And F is for finial for a generational label.
[02:59:05.570 --> 02:59:06.610]  Okay.
[02:59:06.610 --> 02:59:09.090]  All right, Maddie, I'll let you take the dab and we'll let you try again.
[02:59:09.090 --> 02:59:10.450]  I'll let you try again.
[02:59:10.450 --> 02:59:10.770]  All right.
[02:59:12.770 --> 02:59:13.570]  Oh, you guys hear that?
[02:59:13.570 --> 02:59:14.290]  I was trying to let her.
[02:59:15.970 --> 02:59:16.450]  There it is.
[02:59:18.450 --> 02:59:19.890]  This chick takes big dads, dude.
[02:59:20.930 --> 02:59:22.530]  Maddie takes bigger dads than you.
[02:59:22.530 --> 02:59:22.930]  I'm sure.
[02:59:23.650 --> 02:59:23.890]  Yeah.
[02:59:24.770 --> 02:59:26.130]  In the garden, we can get weeded.
[02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:27.890]  All right.
[02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:30.610]  Now that you're blowing out a fat dab and starting off into the sky.
[02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:31.410]  What's the new word?
[02:59:36.220 --> 02:59:37.500]  Nobody else can help.
[02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:40.220]  No, you're the one that you're talking about.
[02:59:40.220 --> 02:59:42.780]  If you're the one protesting, you should find a solution.
[02:59:42.780 --> 02:59:43.020]  Okay.
[02:59:43.020 --> 02:59:47.740]  Can we, can we, you want me to pause and let you take a drink and cope with life for a minute?
[02:59:47.740 --> 02:59:49.420]  Can we, can I think about it?
[02:59:49.420 --> 02:59:52.380]  And next podcast, we can come back with something better.
[02:59:52.380 --> 02:59:52.700]  Okay.
[02:59:52.700 --> 02:59:54.380]  Hey, do you guys want to be on episode number 50?
[02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:59.500]  We'll try to get you to and Adam and Jesse and Mike.
[02:59:59.500 --> 03:00:00.860]  I think I can do that.
[03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:02.700]  I think I can fit that many people.
[03:00:02.700 --> 03:00:03.420]  That's that's a lot.
[03:00:03.420 --> 03:00:03.820]  Just let me know.
[03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:06.220]  I'll go buy some mics and then return it, motherfuckers.
[03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:11.820]  That's the shit your black friends will do.
[03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.020]  Hey, I want to give you guys a shout out.
[03:00:13.020 --> 03:00:15.500]  You were on time as fuck and that's crazy.
[03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:16.060]  Yeah.
[03:00:16.060 --> 03:00:18.620]  That's only because I dragged him out of the house.
[03:00:18.620 --> 03:00:19.420]  This nigga Michael May.
[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:22.460]  You know your house is that close to Amy Donut?
[03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:22.940]  Oh yeah.
[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:24.620]  I got some Amy's Donuts on the counter.
[03:00:24.620 --> 03:00:25.660]  Shout out to Amy's Donuts.
[03:00:25.660 --> 03:00:27.660]  I got a stomachache and a toothache both from them.
[03:00:27.660 --> 03:00:31.660]  But this nigga Michael May, Sam and what, wow, Rice.
[03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:33.900]  He tried to tell me that wild rice ain't rice.
[03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:35.180]  I was like, bro, what the fuck?
[03:00:35.180 --> 03:00:36.220]  They call it wild rice.
[03:00:36.860 --> 03:00:38.540]  Then he made what kind of carrots he made?
[03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:41.980]  Glazed carrots.
[03:00:41.980 --> 03:00:47.500]  Glazed carrots with lemon and some portabella mushrooms sautéed with spinach.
[03:00:47.500 --> 03:00:48.300]  That was banging though.
[03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:49.020]  I fucked with mushrooms.
[03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:53.100]  And Spencer's reply when it all got sat down was, this is some white people shit.
[03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:56.140]  Yeah, but I bet you ate it up just like he did.
[03:00:56.140 --> 03:00:59.340]  I ate the salmon, the rice and then the mushrooms.
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:00.220]  I just like mushrooms.
[03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:00.700]  I'm cool.
[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:01.100]  I fucked with mushrooms.
[03:01:01.100 --> 03:01:02.460]  Yeah, I got us here on time.
[03:01:03.100 --> 03:01:03.660]  Yeah, you did.
[03:01:04.460 --> 03:01:05.580]  I appreciate it.
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:09.420]  I don't know if I'm going to double up if I play the Gardner Whedon song.
[03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:10.700]  I don't know if I have some other shit playing.
[03:01:10.700 --> 03:01:11.980]  I don't want to play two songs at once.
[03:01:11.980 --> 03:01:12.940]  See, I'm glad I checked.
[03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:14.060]  See, I'm learning, bro.
[03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:15.340]  So learning.
[03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:17.180]  We aren't going to double up on two songs.
[03:01:17.180 --> 03:01:18.780]  That would have been awkward sounding.
[03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:19.340]  Way too much.
[03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:21.020]  It would have fucked everyone's heads all up.
[03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:23.260]  All right, we're going to start wrapping up the show.
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:24.700]  Before we go, I do want to say a couple of things.
[03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:25.980]  First, I want to thank you guys for coming, dude.
[03:01:25.980 --> 03:01:27.020]  That was an awesome podcast.
[03:01:27.020 --> 03:01:27.660]  That was fun.
[03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:30.540]  The problem happened to be the first girl on the, or the-
[03:01:30.540 --> 03:01:31.500]  The first woman, shit.
[03:01:31.500 --> 03:01:33.020]  I need a woman credit.
[03:01:33.020 --> 03:01:36.940]  Woman on the show at your location.
[03:01:36.940 --> 03:01:37.420]  It's awesome.
[03:01:37.420 --> 03:01:37.740]  Thank you.
[03:01:37.740 --> 03:01:38.140]  Thank you.
[03:01:38.140 --> 03:01:38.700]  Fist bump.
[03:01:38.700 --> 03:01:39.980]  Oh, Spence is looking at the weed.
[03:01:39.980 --> 03:01:42.140]  There's some Lemon Jeffrey over there in a jar that I grew.
[03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:45.660]  There's some Platinum OGs, some Girl Scout cookies, some Grateful Dog, and some Lemon Jeff.
[03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:47.980]  Grown by me.
[03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:48.700]  Take a peek.
[03:01:48.700 --> 03:01:50.140]  Oh, I can't tell what it is from that angle.
[03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:51.340]  That's Grateful Dog, I think.
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:53.100]  I think so.
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:53.900]  Crack it open.
[03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:55.180]  Crackin' Nugs.
[03:01:55.180 --> 03:01:56.620]  I'm going to talk while he does that.
[03:01:56.620 --> 03:01:58.140]  Uh, yeah, guys, thanks for coming.
[03:01:59.100 --> 03:02:00.460]  Let me remind you guys a couple of things.
[03:02:00.460 --> 03:02:01.420]  I am changing the name.
[03:02:01.420 --> 03:02:02.460]  It's not I Grow Culture.
[03:02:02.460 --> 03:02:04.540]  It's the Grow From Your Heart Podcast now.
[03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:06.780]  I don't want to get sued by that other company.
[03:02:06.780 --> 03:02:08.620]  You guys, I could use a new logo, by the way.
[03:02:09.580 --> 03:02:10.860]  Why are you trying to sue you, dog?
[03:02:10.860 --> 03:02:12.060]  Well, it's my fault.
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:14.780]  That weed's about to fall out there, but it's so sticky, it won't.
[03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:16.860]  No, it's, uh, I stole somebody's name on accident.
[03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:21.020]  I didn't realize it, but they got all popular, and now they're like, oh, you do weed?
[03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:22.300]  You gotta fuck with that, bro.
[03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:23.820]  Yeah, they don't like that, so.
[03:02:23.820 --> 03:02:24.300]  But it's cool.
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:24.940]  I got a cool name.
[03:02:24.940 --> 03:02:25.980]  Grow From Your Heart sounds good.
[03:02:25.980 --> 03:02:26.780]  It's what it's all about.
[03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:27.820]  For sure.
[03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:29.020]  Could use a logo.
[03:02:29.020 --> 03:02:30.220]  You keep asking for a new song.
[03:02:30.220 --> 03:02:30.540]  You know what?
[03:02:30.540 --> 03:02:34.060]  I'm gonna keep playing that song from the Mystic Roots Band and other Mystic Roots Band songs,
[03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:35.820]  because they said I could, and they're free, and I like it.
[03:02:36.540 --> 03:02:38.700]  I'm canceling the Instagram for the podcast.
[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:43.820]  There won't be an I Grow Culture podcast Instagram, but the Iree Genetics one will exist.
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:46.620]  When are you gonna take, are you gonna leave it up for like a week or something?
[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:48.940]  Yeah, I'll leave it up so you can go steal all the pictures or whatever.
[03:02:48.940 --> 03:02:50.140]  And see links.
[03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:51.660]  That's all you need to do?
[03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:55.900]  I'll just start posting those pictures to the Iree Genetics Instagram and have one feed
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:57.740]  instead of having two feeds I'm trying to keep up with.
[03:02:57.740 --> 03:02:59.020]  It's just a lot of shit.
[03:02:59.020 --> 03:03:01.660]  I know that sounds like a bunch of bitching, but it is.
[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.140]  And I'll probably cancel the YouTube for the podcast also, and just keep the,
[03:03:06.140 --> 03:03:09.020]  and start doing something with the Iree Genetics YouTube or something.
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:14.060]  Just so much goddamn media I can't keep up, and I want to focus on doing a good podcast
[03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:15.500]  is really what I'm wanting to do.
[03:03:16.140 --> 03:03:19.260]  If you guys want to email me, you can use igrowculture at hotmail.com
[03:03:19.260 --> 03:03:21.420]  or growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[03:03:21.420 --> 03:03:22.140]  I check them both.
[03:03:22.700 --> 03:03:24.300]  Episode 50 is coming up.
[03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:25.340]  I think Spence will make it.
[03:03:25.340 --> 03:03:26.300]  I think Maddie will make it.
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:27.660]  We'll have Jesse, hopefully.
[03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:29.420]  I'm trying to get Mike, trying to get Adam.
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:31.100]  You guys are invited if you're listening, you guys.
[03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:35.500]  I'm going to make Jesse come.
[03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:36.460]  Yeah, there we go.
[03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:39.420]  Jesse, Adam, Mike, Maddie, Spence, myself.
[03:03:40.540 --> 03:03:42.220]  That might fill this little space we got.
[03:03:42.220 --> 03:03:43.260]  We might have to fucking go.
[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:45.900]  This is going to be hot boxed.
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:46.780]  Yeah, it is.
[03:03:46.780 --> 03:03:47.020]  Yeah.
[03:03:47.020 --> 03:03:48.780]  So episode 50 will be a small celebration.
[03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:51.500]  Jesse teased that he would have some prizes.
[03:03:51.500 --> 03:03:57.020]  I definitely have at least an iRegenetics t-shirt or three to give away, like a hat pin.
[03:03:57.020 --> 03:03:58.780]  But he's got any prizes or something.
[03:03:58.780 --> 03:03:59.580]  I got some t-shirts.
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:03:59.980]  Okay.
[03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:02.300]  Yeah, let me check.
[03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:03.100]  We got something.
[03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:03.740]  I got something.
[03:04:03.740 --> 03:04:04.460]  I got something.
[03:04:04.460 --> 03:04:07.420]  Yeah, see, we got some Garden of Weeden prizes coming on episode 50, guys.
[03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:09.820]  As always, we'll leave it like that, random prize.
[03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:11.180]  Yeah, yeah, that's kind of what I'm doing too,
[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:13.260]  until I run downstairs and check the little box that I've been-
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:13.500]  It's going to be good, though.
[03:04:13.500 --> 03:04:16.700]  I've been just throwing shit into a pile, you know, I don't want to dedicate too much.
[03:04:16.700 --> 03:04:19.020]  But when episode 50 comes, Jesse promised some stuff.
[03:04:19.020 --> 03:04:20.380]  So what's up, Jesse, if you're listening, bro?
[03:04:20.380 --> 03:04:22.940]  Episode 50 is in like a week and a half, if you're listening to this.
[03:04:24.860 --> 03:04:26.140]  Guys, I want you to message me.
[03:04:26.140 --> 03:04:28.380]  Let me know what you learned on the podcast,
[03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:30.860]  because we want to talk about that on episode 50 and recap for you.
[03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:31.900]  Like we did the year in review.
[03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:34.060]  I kind of want to know what you learned from the show.
[03:04:34.060 --> 03:04:35.500]  I want to know who your favorite guests were.
[03:04:35.500 --> 03:04:36.780]  I think I just listed them, right?
[03:04:36.780 --> 03:04:40.540]  It was fucking Spencer, Jesse, Mike, Adam, Maddie.
[03:04:40.540 --> 03:04:41.900]  Who else has been on the show lately?
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:42.220]  Clint.
[03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:43.340]  Clint's an awesome guest.
[03:04:43.980 --> 03:04:44.860]  Sean, dude, fucking-
[03:04:44.860 --> 03:04:46.700]  I think Sean got the most listens.
[03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:49.420]  Sean definitely got the most listens.
[03:04:49.420 --> 03:04:50.060]  Yeah.
[03:04:50.060 --> 03:04:53.020]  If you want to come be on episode 50, you can, bro, but it's going to be a party.
[03:04:53.020 --> 03:04:56.220]  I'd kind of rather reserve your knowledge for when it's just you and I face to face,
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:04:58.220]  because you fucking school me and it's awesome.
[03:04:58.940 --> 03:05:02.300]  So guys, if there's somebody around here you'd like to have on the podcast, let me know.
[03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:04.380]  It's hard for me to reach out to people.
[03:05:05.020 --> 03:05:07.580]  If you have something you want me to ask other people and you have some ideas,
[03:05:07.580 --> 03:05:11.340]  if you're like, get this person on, back that up with a like and ask them this.
[03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:13.020]  And I'll do that because that'll help me out.
[03:05:13.020 --> 03:05:13.260]  Cool.
[03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:16.620]  I'm going to turn off your mic.
[03:05:16.620 --> 03:05:17.100]  There you go.
[03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:17.580]  Turn it down.
[03:05:17.580 --> 03:05:17.980]  Go for it.
[03:05:18.060 --> 03:05:22.060]  I was going to say now that I can, now that you can, nobody can hear you now, so go for it.
[03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:22.540]  Finch.
[03:05:22.540 --> 03:05:23.020]  All right.
[03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:24.060]  We got you back.
[03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:24.860]  I got you back.
[03:05:24.860 --> 03:05:25.420]  I'm back.
[03:05:26.460 --> 03:05:28.060]  He's doing black folk business over there.
[03:05:29.020 --> 03:05:30.380]  So send me some input, you guys.
[03:05:30.380 --> 03:05:33.340]  It's igrowculturehotmail.com, growfromyourhearthotmail.com,
[03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:34.620]  or you could tweet me.
[03:05:35.580 --> 03:05:36.540]  It's igrowculture.
[03:05:36.540 --> 03:05:39.340]  I might make a new one since Finch had that idea.
[03:05:39.340 --> 03:05:39.980]  It's kind of smart.
[03:05:39.980 --> 03:05:41.180]  I probably will.
[03:05:41.180 --> 03:05:42.060]  Grow from your heart.
[03:05:42.060 --> 03:05:43.340]  We'll have a new Twitter page.
[03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:45.340]  I'm sure there's something that's growing from your heart somewhere else
[03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:46.940]  that's going to fucking try to sue me for that too.
[03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:48.860]  But that's what we're going to do.
[03:05:48.860 --> 03:05:49.420]  Or no.
[03:05:50.140 --> 03:05:52.220]  Yeah, we'll just, we'll stand up for this one.
[03:05:52.220 --> 03:05:54.940]  I've had that on my website for a long time, so I think I own that one.
[03:05:55.580 --> 03:05:56.140]  All right.
[03:05:56.140 --> 03:05:56.620]  Cool.
[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:57.980]  Big fist bump to everybody at the table.
[03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:58.940]  I'm going to read this part.
[03:05:58.940 --> 03:06:01.500]  It goes, now that the show is over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[03:06:01.500 --> 03:06:04.700]  Go to the iTunes or Stitcher main page and search for the I Grow Culture podcast.
[03:06:04.700 --> 03:06:06.780]  Oh, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast, or one of the two.
[03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:07.340]  Search for both.
[03:06:08.060 --> 03:06:09.100]  Find the review section.
[03:06:09.100 --> 03:06:10.140]  Give us a five-star rating.
[03:06:10.140 --> 03:06:11.260]  After that, type in a comment.
[03:06:11.260 --> 03:06:15.020]  Let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comments on the podcast.
[03:06:15.100 --> 03:06:18.060]  Guys, don't forget that the show is available on iTunes and Stitcher,
[03:06:18.060 --> 03:06:23.580]  and every single episode will always be archived at iRegeneticsColorado.com.

[03:06:30.140 --> 03:06:31.420]  It's Garden of Weeden.
[03:06:31.980 --> 03:06:33.420]  All one word with an N.
[03:06:33.980 --> 03:06:35.020]  The Garden of Weed-en.
[03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:37.180]  Make sure you follow those guys.
[03:06:37.180 --> 03:06:39.660]  Make sure you follow Greenworks.
[03:06:39.660 --> 03:06:40.860]  We told you how to spell that earlier.
[03:06:40.860 --> 03:06:42.700]  I hope you caught it, because I forgot, because I'm high.
[03:06:43.260 --> 03:06:44.300]  High is fine.
[03:06:44.300 --> 03:06:45.340]  High is fuck.
[03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:46.380]  Right on for the dabs, you guys.
[03:06:46.380 --> 03:06:47.740]  You showed up with a bunch of great dabs.
[03:06:48.540 --> 03:06:48.860]  Man.
[03:06:49.580 --> 03:06:50.140]  No problem.
[03:06:50.140 --> 03:06:51.660]  Definitely brought the Yeti OG.
[03:06:51.660 --> 03:06:53.500]  That's one of our favorites.
[03:06:53.500 --> 03:06:55.020]  The flavor on it's ridiculous.
[03:06:55.020 --> 03:06:56.620]  That rig, dude, broke my face.
[03:06:56.620 --> 03:06:59.580]  It made a whole challenge to do a podcast at the beginning.
[03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:00.780]  It was kind of neat.
[03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:02.780]  Make sure you follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[03:07:02.780 --> 03:07:03.660]  Please do that.
[03:07:03.660 --> 03:07:07.420]  We're at like 10,000 and some change now, so that's kind of cool.
[03:07:07.420 --> 03:07:09.740]  If you guys are interested in sponsoring the podcast,
[03:07:09.740 --> 03:07:11.820]  or if you've got a product you'd like us to review,
[03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:14.540]  send me an email to igrowculturehotmail.com
[03:07:14.540 --> 03:07:16.860]  or growfromyourhearthotmail.com,

[03:07:19.020 --> 03:07:19.980]  I do need a logo.
[03:07:19.980 --> 03:07:20.860]  Keep saying that.
[03:07:20.860 --> 03:07:22.140]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[03:07:22.140 --> 03:07:23.260]  Shout out to Angela.
[03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:24.540]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[03:07:24.540 --> 03:07:26.540]  Until next time, take a fat dab.
[03:07:26.540 --> 03:07:27.500]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:30.220]  We're going to end the show with a song by our boy Sloppy.
[03:07:30.220 --> 03:07:31.420]  It's a Garden Weeding song.
[03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:32.940]  It takes a second for it to roll in,
[03:07:32.940 --> 03:07:34.620]  so we might just ramble for a second.
[03:07:35.180 --> 03:07:37.820]  I'm actually going to fire up a big dab of this live resin,
[03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:40.220]  and then we'll turn the mics down and let the song kick on.
[03:07:40.220 --> 03:07:41.500]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:07:42.940 --> 03:07:43.820]  Goodbye.
[03:07:43.820 --> 03:07:44.380]  Bye, y'all.
[03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:48.070]  Squat.

[03:07:56.370 --> 03:07:56.870]  you know?
[03:08:01.890 --> 03:08:03.490]  Garden weeding in this bitch.
[03:08:17.850 --> 03:08:19.690]  Back for you, squat, like you know no other.
[03:08:19.690 --> 03:08:21.530]  Turn on each other and kill your brother.
[03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:22.330]  Trust no bullet.
[03:08:22.330 --> 03:08:23.370]  I'm going to call it how I see it.
[03:08:23.370 --> 03:08:24.090]  Today, you got fire.
[03:08:24.090 --> 03:08:25.290]  I'm going to call it how I breathe it.
[03:08:25.290 --> 03:08:25.930]  Always got work.
[03:08:25.930 --> 03:08:27.130]  You can call me when you need it.
[03:08:27.130 --> 03:08:28.450]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:28.450 --> 03:08:28.970]  Weeded.
[03:08:28.970 --> 03:08:30.410]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:32.570]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:34.090]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:34.090 --> 03:08:34.590]  Aye.
[03:08:34.590 --> 03:08:36.410]  I'm just going to call it how I see it.
[03:08:36.410 --> 03:08:38.210]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:38.210 --> 03:08:39.390]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:39.390 --> 03:08:39.890]  Weeded.
[03:08:39.890 --> 03:08:41.350]  In the garden, weeding getting weeded.
[03:08:41.350 --> 03:08:45.560]  weeded.
[03:08:45.560 --> 03:08:47.280]  Only fire when I breathe it.
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:48.440]  In the garden weeding, when you're
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:49.100]  groping getting weeded.
[03:08:49.100 --> 03:08:50.600]  Fucking all week, until the weekend.
[03:08:50.600 --> 03:08:52.560]  Don't hate if I want it, and then I need it.
[03:08:52.560 --> 03:08:53.940]  All enemies get defeated.
[03:08:53.940 --> 03:08:54.880]  Drama don't need it.
[03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:56.520]  They're eye strong when I wear these on.
[03:08:56.520 --> 03:08:57.320]  Blow like a bomb.

[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:29.320]  Better be your own hero
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:31.320]  Break your own chains
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:33.320]  Control your own lane
[03:09:33.320 --> 03:09:35.320]  Influence your own brain
