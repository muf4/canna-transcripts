For decades there have been two families in cannabis.
The outdoor growers who use the sunshine and indoor growers who used lights.
They each developed their own approaches. Both dabbled in synthetic nutrients but
indoor growers really approached synthetic and processed nutrients as an
art form.
Outdoor folks generally were using less processed inputs but certainly not
always and both groups tended to use chemical pesticides when needed.
Over the last 20 years as people became more aware of eating organic food,
health-conscious cannabis farmers both indoors and outdoors began reducing
their synthetic inputs and using more raw natural materials. Very generally
though it was the outdoor folks who were leading in that direction and indoor
growers were still focused on bottled nutrients especially hydroponic folks.
All of that has been turned upside down as more cultivators in every part of the
industry began to use more natural inputs and then with state taxation of
cannabis came regulations that nearly demanded the exclusion of many of the
traditional chemicals growers would use. As a person who's dedicated to living
soil you can imagine my curiosity and glee when I came across images on
Instagram of grow operations in just about every legal state beginning to
bring living soil techniques indoors. The lushness of the polyculture and
companion planning but done indoors in raised beds or on tables. I started
talking to other folks like me about these amazing photos I was seeing and
they were all jazzed about these new possibilities too. A bright future of
climate-controlled indoor growing but with real living soil and worms instead
of mechanized hydroponics. If you want to learn about cannabis health business and

host Shango Lose. My guest today is Joshua Steensland. Joshua Steensland is a
lifelong cannabis cultivator and educator. He is presently lead cultivator
at Freshwater Farms in Oregon. He also has a very active YouTube channel where
he teaches cannabis horticulture. Formerly he was a hydroponics store
owner with a heavy emphasis on customer education and has himself evolved from
using synthetics to using organic bottled nutrients and is now dedicated to living
soil, no-till and raw amendments. Today we're going to talk about all those
things. Welcome to the show Joshua. Hey thanks for having me. Oh so glad to have
you on. So let's start by giving a little context to folks about where you come
from kind of I don't know philosophically. So how did you find your
way to indoor polyculture? Like were you an indoor guy who wanted to be more
natural or were you an outdoor guy who then you brought your outdoor skills
indoors for work? Yeah I'm actually always been an indoor cultivator and I
just I never had the space to do it outdoors and always just kind of was
really intrigued with the idea of being having a controlled environment and
being able to control all those different atmospheric variables and and
eventually just kind of gravitated towards wanting to do things in a more
natural fashion and that's how I ended up where I'm at. It's really interesting
because you know for so long you know a lot of the indoor folks were like listen
you just can't use these outdoor techniques indoors they just don't make
the transition and for a long time people kind of you know some people
believe that and now suddenly in the last few years people like you are
actually doing it. So when you first started you know implementing this stuff
and you know telling your buddies about it did you get some disbelief and push
back and you had to push you know you know prove them wrong or were people
like hell yeah man go that direction? There was a fair amount of healthy
skepticism and and as I just kept progressing and kept kept pushing
forward people were seeing the results I was getting and they're kind of
speak for themselves. Yeah they sure do I mean that's that's what started all of
this with me reaching out to you is I just started following you on Instagram
and the the the images of your poly cultured tables at Freshwater which is
like astonishing it was you know just like looking them and and making the
picture big you know and so that you can look really closely and going oh my god
he's actually doing this. So that was all really exciting so so you know aside
from the cannabis chemovars that you're choosing how did you go about
choosing your companion plants because you've got a lot of options to choose
from how did you think through that that that challenge? That's a good question I
mean there's a lot of really good information and there's a lot of great
companies like Build A Soil that put together cover crop blends that are kind
of pre-made for living soils that have lots of clover and you know nitrogen
fixing companion plants. With that available that kind of information
available readily available it was really easy to kind of just dive in and
start learning what was happening below the surface you know not with just the
cannabis roots but with the roots of the other plants and and even like the
foliage with the dynamic accumulators like comfrey and whatnot that I just
really just dove in and started looking into what all those what all the benefits
are and everything that I kept coming up with was diversity is key you know you
really you really want a diverse population of companion plants to
because they all do something different they all have their their little part to
play in this symphony and it just seems to me that the more parts the more
things that allow to play their part the sweeter the music. Oh right on that's
nicely put so so how many notes do you use you know this may be a question that
you don't actually know but do you know how many other species of companion
plants you've got outside of the cannabis? Oh my goodness it's it's pretty
considerable I started with the 12 seed cover crop blend from Build a Soil and
then which is you know like 60% clovers different clovers and and vetch and
whatnot and then I started adding other things like daikon radish, beets, broccoli
we have and and I've recently learned that broccoli might actually not be good
because of a potential fungal inhibiting component of it of it so I have to some
research to do on that but so we're always learning you know we're all I'm
forever educating myself and if I learn that something's not good for the bed
like if I learn that broccoli is not good I'm taking it out for sure but I've
got so many so many things in there I'm really just not afraid to throw anything
in there. So so so all right so the broccoli may not make it or may not stay
but have you already experimented with any other plants that you decided don't
work for you? To be honest with you no you know everything tends to the things
that some things just don't come back from the flowering period because the
canopy gets so dense there's a relatively large die-off that happens
underneath so during the vegetative stage when there's lots of light
penetrating the cover crop flourishes and then your companion plants flourish
and then the canopy kind of overtakes things and you get a lot less light down
there to the soil surface and then there's this die-off and sometimes
things just don't come back like I've had comfrey die-off and not come back
and I don't really fuss or worry about it I just figure if the conditions
weren't right for that particular one to come back then I'm not really worried.
That's that's really interesting I've never really considered how the the dense
canopy of a cannabis plant would block out the light from the unders and
suddenly it's like you know like when you visit the the the giant redwoods
right it's mostly just ferns and and you know duff on the ground at that point
and so a lot of the plants that when the plants are when the cannabis plants
are young they're getting full light suddenly they're gonna get choked out
it's have you ever like replanted or added low-light plants like when you
start bloom? That's a that's an interesting consideration I really have
I haven't though I do reseed occasionally like if we get a
significant die-off and for one reason or another sometimes the the large
leaves like say especially of comfrey they'll die off and they'll completely
choke out any light from the soil surface so you end up once the comfrey
leaves have been kind of consumed by the soil biology you're left with a bare
spot and so occasionally I'll have to reseed those bare spots and but us
making specific light low-light plant considerations I just haven't done that
I really kind of appreciate the nutrient cycling faction factor that happens when
the cover crop flourishes it's got all this nutrient capacity in its leaves and
then the flowering period starts and then so it dies off and creates like a
mulchy layer over the soil so it's just building to the humus layer it's
contributing to a nutrient cycling and more importantly it just allows me to
spend less time in the garden and just allow that kind of little micro
ecosystem to do its thing. So I certainly get the value of when you get the die
off that that nutrient cycling is natural and good I've got I've got
two I guess really specific questions about that so the first one would be you
know if if having the cover crop with one of the benefits of it is that it
creates this like mini rainforest down near the bottom so it holds in moisture
and and water vapor down towards the the top of the soil so that your microbes
can live closer to the top of the soil does it do you do worry at all that if
you've got these patches that you're losing that advantage or over the over
the size of an entire bed it doesn't really matter that much? I think when you
take the whole bed into consideration it's it's not as big of a factor and
that's the benefit I think of having a larger soil volume I've often used the
analogy of aquarium keeping your fish tanks and that I used to keep little
nano reef tanks and 55 gallon tanks and and for obvious reasons the smaller the
tank the harder it is to keep things in equilibrium you know and the larger the
volume of water in a tank it's a lot easier to keep it pH stable and and
everything so it's really similar in soil beds if you've got a larger 4 by
8 you got 1.2 or 1.3 yards in of soil in your bed little pockets of case a
anaerobic bacterial activity or you know little pockets of areas that are
running less than optimally aren't aren't such a big deal. Right on I'm gonna
take a little sidebar here you mentioned aquariums and and I too have got a
background in aquariums and actually after my brain injury one of the only
things I could do was raise specialty aquarium shrimp and sell those other
aquarium people and you know not only do like you know stoner folk just like
looking at fish right but other than that I find that people who are into
aquariums and building that kind of natural and yet artificial environment
also take quickly to growing cannabis because they are similar ideas
where it's like okay I want to make this as natural as possible but I want to do
it in this artificial environment and encapsulate nature you know inside my
home. Was that kind of an experience for you too? Absolutely I've said I've had
similar conversations with people about this very topic that and at the time at
one point in time I was really big into hydroponics and recirculating deep water
culture and and I very often just kept feeling like it was back in my aquarium
days because we're really in both of those instances you're just water
keepers you know your water tenders and it's your and it's your job to keep the
water you know the water conditions perfect and so there's a there's that
obvious correlation there and I think you you kind of touched on it too that
there's this kind of desire to recreate something natural and and do it you know
in the most pristine way possible and there's just there's kind of this
intrinsic reward there. I like your idea of aquarium being we're water keepers it
reminds me it reminds me of the famous natural farming guy Joel Saladin who
always said listen I don't I don't farm foods and chickens and cattle he's like
I'm a grass farmer and so long as the grass is healthy and pesticide and
chemical free all the animals that live upon it will do well and I always thought
that that you know related really well to regenerative cannabis growing as well
where a lot of what we're doing is is we're soil farmers we're microbe farmers
and as long as that soil is bountiful it will offer the buffet of all the
nutrients that our cannabis plants need and then they just do it on their own.
Without question it's it's a it's a wonderful beautiful miracle that we've
been you know that we've been given and I'm really proud and impressed to see
the speed at which people are starting to kind of reclaim this old you know
this old ways you know there's like this revival of the old ways people are
sick of you know being lied to and being poisoned and and and you realize that
there's just a simpler way and if you just take care of the soil it takes care
of you. So circling back to when we were talking about some of the spots of the
the cover crop dying out do you ever find that that is helpful like a canary
in a coal mine where if something's going on with your cover crop maybe it's
it's like letting you know of a problem early that you might experience with the
cannabis plants themselves? Yeah I mean I think if you allowed yourself to kind of
hyper analyze things you could definitely kind of postulate what's
going on. I tend to I'm really tend to be very very very hands-off I'm very
fukuoka-esque in I like to just observe you know once once the plants are in
once things are going you it's really just our job to observe and kind of do
gentle steering and guiding and and that's what really works for me. My days
of being kind of the mad scientist in the grow room and spending hours in
there you know fussing over pH levels and all these other things those are
over those are long gone. So to get to your question is when I see bare spots
on there it's usually always been because of a thick patch from the die
off and if it and when I re-veg if it doesn't get kind of repopulated by their
the bloom of regrowth then I'll you know the next cycle I'll re-seed
it and I really don't worry or concern myself too much because you know it's a
it's a really simple process and if you as long as you follow a few a few simple
rules it's really hard to go wrong. Right on. So this next question I'm gonna I'm
gonna suggest three categories of polycultural planting and and you are
clearly more advanced than I am on this so I'm gonna I'm gonna suggest this
theory and then I just want to hear your your thoughts on it even even if
you vehemently disagree. So I find that so far in my learning about
polyculture planting they seem to fall into three categories like first is
companion planting of plants that seem to encourage cannabis plant growth and
then there seems to be inter planting which is just simply green filler to
cover soil so that the moisture is higher up in the soil towards the
surface and they you know they participate in a generally healthy
rhizosphere and then and then there's I guess there's four categories. IPM
planting of plants that has something to do with keeping pests away and then some
people add a fourth category which is as food right so if you're gonna go through
all this this effort you might as well get some you know you know some cherry
tomatoes to eat while you're there or to the extreme example you know Nick and
Liz over at Green Source Gardens where where they're getting huge amounts of
food out of their outdoor gardens. So with this in mind you know how do you
think about the different categories of polyculture plants when you are
strategizing? That's a really good question and I've just got to give huge
shout out to Green Source Gardens those guys are just the shining example of
regenerative homesteading and I just you know what they have is something we
should all be striving for you know it's just they've got a really beautiful
thing and I can't say enough good things about what what they do. I second that
the tour I got there this summer floored me it's like this is the gold standard
for what we're all trying to do. Yeah without question without question they
are the shining example the tip of the spear and they they deserve all the
alkylates that that come with that. As far as the polyculture you know all the
categories that you mentioned I think we should when when participating in
this cultivation style you we should try to achieve all of those things in the
beds you know I think at first my first concern was maybe just kind of nutrient
cycling and moisture retention. So there was a time when I just used ryegrass one
time I just planted a bunch of ryegrass just just specifically to kind of
eliminate a lot of the composting material that I had because I had a
problem with woodlouse and roly-polies and so I was trying to eliminate their
food source you know just kind of messing around with things. And I didn't
I didn't really like how the how it felt and then what what I got in the end when
the die-off happened I ended up with just this huge mat of ryegrass and it
just didn't really work for me and and I've really learned that the once again
the greater diversity I had the healthier things seem to be and that's
when I started to include the food crops that I don't really harvest I just leave
in to rot like the beets and the daikon parsnips and those kinds of things you
know I think they're just just wildly valuable to the the soil. That's
interesting that you leave them in because I can see the advantages from
that of course as well I mean I like the idea of growing the food and being
able to extract extra value out of the garden and also you know that the
novelty right oh hey look what I grew next to my cannabis plants indoors right
that's kind of cool but the idea of letting it go through its life cycle and
then rotting there in the soil of course that's gonna create the opportunity for
so many micronutrients that you wouldn't normally have so now I want to play
with that. Sure yeah I think of it as just varying the kind of the nutrient
volumes in the earthworm castings they would the natural earthworm castings
that we get you know if we give them various food sources you know then the
the quality of the castings that we get fresh from the source in the beds is
gonna be better. So you know when we design our our arc of light if we will
for the cannabis plants and you know I think I think you do 18-6 a lot of folks
do 18-6 and then we switch to 12-12 for the bloom but that's not really true for
a lot of the plants that we are putting into our polyculture and I'm curious
what your experience has been finding these other plants these multitude of
plants that you're putting alongside the cannabis how do they react to 18-6 and
then 12-12 and specifically when you flip because I would think that while we
do that to kind of startle the cannabis plants to suddenly bloom that may well
freak out a lot of the companion plants but I've never grown it at the level as
you have to like you know have a good set of data. That's a really good
question I mean what I've observed over time is the like for instance the
broccoli never flowers it just for whatever reason and I don't know enough
about how broccoli works necessarily that it just is all it just stays in
this perpetual vegetative state and so that's the one one thing that I've
noticed different it's hard to tell what differences what the differences
are attributed to when we flip flipped a flower because the canopy is so dense by
that time that changes have kind of already started to happen at the lower
levels before we even flipped it to 12 and 12 because of the reduced light so
it's really difficult to say you know there's a pretty drastic and pronounced
die-off you know late in veg once the canopy is thick enough you know to
initiate flower at that point in time they've been under reduced light for
several weeks and it's really hard to say what what light is doing at that
point yeah you got a lot of variables at that point and no control group yeah
that makes sense so as far as like water usage goes you know I find that
generally the way that I've done in the past kind of pre polyculture since this
is new to me as well but I have found that indoor generally needs to be
watered more than outdoor but when you companion plant this much you know
you're retaining a lot of water and the plants create that moist rainforest
effect at soil level so how does planting polyculture impact the water
requirements it's it's incredible how little water is needed for a for a 4 by
8 bed when it's when it's properly cultivated the the companion plants do
such a good job or even if you just used a straw mulch and you weren't even
companion planting the anything covering the soil is gonna help retain that
moisture and help prevent you know the transpiration of it and and yeah so I
get by like in my home grow I got three four by eight beds and they're fed by a
like a seven gallon reservoir to blue mat drippers and if I had to turn the
water off that seven gallons would last me four or five days maybe even a week
so the water requirements are so nil and it I think it's just insanely
valuable especially as we you know when we start thinking about conservation
yeah that polyculture plus blue mat really is a nice system game-changer
yeah totally so hey let's take our first short break and be right back you're
listening to shaping fire and my guest today is Joshua Steensland lead
cultivator at freshwater farms living soil and regenerative cannabis
agriculture are surging in popularity and to implement these biological
solutions real science education is vital if you are interested in all
things probiotic growing you will probably want to attend the upcoming
science of organic regenerative cannabis cultivation conference Joshua
Rutherford of Dutch blooms has lined up an incredible array of educators for the
traveling event the teaching staff includes Layton Morrison and Elaine
Ingham on soil biology Chris Trump talking Korean natural farming Kevin
Jodry on cannabis genetics Kelly and Josh from dragonfly earth medicine
Suzanne Wainwright the bug lady dr. Robert Faust on natural biostimulants
Stephen Reisner on aquaponics and chip Osborne on soil testing and even more
folks will be there there will be a grower panel a breeding panel and a dem
certified farmers panel Joshua has even built in significant informal time for
you with the teachers as well the teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending and there's no advertising at
the event no vendor booths your tuition is what is paying the staff so they all
be very present and attentive to you not a corporate sponsor even better the
conference is not just for folks on the West Coast Humboldt California is
hosting one event for sure but the show is going on the road to Vancouver
British Columbia Portland Maine and Ann Arbor Michigan get out your pen now
because I'm about to give you the website this is a fabulous opportunity
for you to hear from an array of nationally recognized top-shelf soil
educators all in one place not only that this isn't just beginner stuff like you
get at most conventions this is an intensive for people like us who totally
nerd out on the rhizosphere the website is regenerative organic cannabis calm
that's regenerative organic cannabis calm you can also find a link on the
shaping fire Instagram and newsletter cut through all the misinformation out
there and don't miss this opportunity to learn real soil science as a listener
of shaping fire you already understand the importance of living soil when
growing cannabis when you have active microbe communities in your substrate
you go way beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and potassium
having active microorganisms in your substrate supports vigorous plant growth
throughout the plants root zone making for higher yields and thriving flowers
mammoth pea is the first organically derived microbial inoculant that focuses
on your plants nutrient cycling processes to release soil phosphorus and
other micronutrients from their bound forms making them more available to the
plant increased levels of phosphorus will also keep inner nodes shorter and
focus your plants energy on bud production not only that but the
microbes act as a defense shield for the plants rhizosphere by out competing
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes pretty cool right mammoth pea not only
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but it also helps protect your plant from
disease mammoth peas beneficial bacteria act like micro bioreactors continually
producing enzymes that release nutrients mammoth pea was developed at a US
University has been extensively tested by Colorado growers and independent
laboratories mammoth pea is proven to increase growth and enhance blooming one
of the great things about supplementing with microorganisms is that they won't
compete with whatever fertilizer program you're already running simply dose on
top of your fertilizer schedule for increased benefits to learn more and to
find out where you can buy mammoth pea near you check out their website at
www.mammothmicrobes.com partner with microorganisms to create beautiful
thriving cannabis mammoth pea welcome back you are listening to shaping fire
and I'm your host shango lows and our guest this week is Joshua Steensland
lead cultivator at freshwater farms so before the break we were talking about
the variety of polyculture plants and the positive impacts that they offer in
your indoor grow I'm really curious when you are choosing your plants for
integrated pest management did you choose for all potential pests that
could happen or did you choose plants that would be helpful for the ones that
you usually have to deal with locally in your bioregion that's a good question I
didn't give it a heck of a lot of consideration aside from just just basic
knowledge like I meant I use mint and marigold at times mint has been my main
kind of IPM companion plant but but mainly I tend to use companion plants
less for IPM and more for pests kind of like the canary in the coal mine for
pest ID I've learned that clover flower when it's allowed to flower really the
thrips really like clover flowers so once you have flowering clover if you
they're gonna thrips are gonna attack that clover first spider might seem to
really like clover over cannabis as well so I mean these are the those that's
kind of a low-hanging fruit so to me the companion plant is really more of an
observational tool to to kind of help me see where we have a potential hot spot
and and then and also just knowing things that like clover flower attracts
thrips you can take some preventative measure preventive IPM measures by
adding the proper beneficials say before your clover is flowering to tackle the
potential influx of thrips I like that idea of the plant as the canary in coal
mine because I you know I had not really considered that perspective in for when
planting companion plants to for IPM normally it's either okay I'm gonna add
this plant because it gives off terpenes that wards off pests right so that's one
and then and then just simple trap plants which is kind of what you're
talking about about the clover flowers because it will attract the thrips to
your clover flower instead of to your cannabis but but this idea this
additional idea that oh it's a third you know these these trap plants are
actually a thermometer letting me know how how much my my pest infants
infestation is because you know as as all of us living soil folks know it's
not about having zero trips it's about keeping the thrips you have in balance
and never letting them you know overrun the grow and I think that's a really
novel idea yeah it's it's it's one of those things that you know clover
spider mites like the clover it doesn't mean they're not gonna make their way
onto your cannabis but they certainly hit the clover first and same definitely
with the thrips and it's just one of those deals or like I said the low
hanging fruit and if you're observing that that's usually where you're gonna
start to get your first signs and indications and it's been an insanely
invaluable tool over the years while we're talking about pests let's uh let's
talk about the use of essential oils so a lot of folks you know there's a there's
an ongoing debate right people say that if you foliar feed certain essential
oils that the the pests don't like it and so they'll avoid your cannabis
plants and certainly we're talking about you know veg or only in the first you
know maybe week of flower we're not talking about late in flower but but then
other folks right the other folks will say nah nah nah you don't want to spray
essential oils on your plants because the oils plug stomata and make it more
difficult for the plants to breathe and and I've watched enough of the videos on
your fabulous YouTube channel to know that you've got a pretty strong
understanding of cannabis botany itself so so what were your thoughts be on on
this ongoing debate um well I think I think context is important here I mean
if if if we're talking about just you know you're like if we're talking about
like say a method one PPS which is essential oils and I think a little bit
of alcohol you know I'm I've no problem with those I I think that there is a
potential before cuz say neem oils or some really heavily applied essential
oils to clog the stomata especially if you're using them in in succession like
you just one essential oil spray after another yeah I think there's a potential
for buildup and and and possible stomata blockage but I think that if you're if
your IPM practices were such that you're hitting it with an essential oil on day
one and so maybe day three doing like an aloe rinse on your leaves or whatever as
a foliar like that those if you're practicing your IPM in that fashion I
think if that's drastically going to reduce the possibility of that happening
I think that if you went with kind of a commercially produced oil product those
tend to be really light in the oils it's gonna be your DIY guys that might go a
little heavy with the oils and whatnot or and they could run into potential
issues I think I think adding a rinse is is important yeah I have been that place
myself when I was more of a rookie than I am now where it's like well if it says
this much is good if I add three times that amount it's gonna be triple
strength you know what in the end it doesn't really work and like most of
these ideas that we're talking about it's about balance right so and our
moderation is what I meant to say moderation so so yeah if you're gonna
use these foliars use them in moderation don't plan on leaning on them to do to
do all the lifting definitely definitely less is more I it's easier to add than
subtract in situations like this if you've overdone it it's especially with
foliar feeding or with with IPM or even like if if you're feeding some kind of
bottled nutrient regime it's it's always you always want to start with less
because it's easier to add the things that maybe you didn't get in the first
time than it is to kind of take it back once you've applied it to the plant yeah
it's way hard to take so you know pretty much everybody has been in the
situation where they're they're late into bloom and you get a pest
infestation at you know the worst possible time and and granted you know
if if you've got a clean room if you've got you know IPM plants planted if you
are are doing foliars in in in vegetative state if you are you know if
you're doing all of this stuff your likelihood should be very low however
you know sometimes bad things happen to good people so so if you were to get an
infestation let's just pick spider mites but you can give you know whatever
example you most appropriate to you but something like that in week say four
where you're not going to be doing a lot of these sprays because it'll mess with
the taste of the flowers and then could potentially risk molds then because the
the flowers will be getting wet what are your go-to solutions at that point where
everything is so limited our options yeah I mean I think if nobody wants to
be in that position and at some you have to kind of just gauge how how severe
your infestation is and in the beautiful thing about about this situation is is
that if you've had had good practices like you were saying up to step to four
weeks and you just got kind of an incidental exposure that could that could
be pretty easily fixed with a heavy dose of beneficial predators you know that
that's pretty much your only go-to in this in this instance and you know if if
you're at week four and you have a severe infestation with webbing and
whatnot you messed up so so there's some serious user error so if that if
that week for you've got just kind of a light little hot spot in your grow you
know things to consider are hitting it with a very heavy dose of like you know
facilities are really like very hungry predators or just kind of rooting that
spot out and cutting it out and cutting your losses so if it's one or two plants
in the back of your greenhouse or one or two plants in one of your beds it
might be worth it to just kind of cut your losses get rid of the ones that
that could be problematic but I tend to want to throw live stuff at it and and
try my luck with that I'm glad you mentioned the beneficials because I've
become a big fan of beneficials and this year was the first year that I use them
heavily from veg all the way through the end with other three different
applications and it was it was delightful I didn't have any pest issues
this year which was like astonishing and fantastic so did you find that your
companion plants especially the trap plants were also attracting your
beneficials or were you able to choose trap plants that were more interested
that the pests were more interested in them than any of the beneficials you were
using well that's a good question I think that anytime that I've had that
experience where I've seen it on the clover we took really quick and decisive
action so we didn't really don't give it much time to to observe whether it
liked the cannabis more or what are the predators had more of an effect at first
the first sign of any kind of nonsense we just throw an obscene amount of bugs
at it and and and that you that's every time has done the trick you know I I
really think that I would love to be able to do a no spray IPM on the
commercial scale and I think it's doable I think that no spray IPM is is really
like the most ideal way to go about that way you can just focus on your foliar
feeding and and know that your pests are are handled by the predators but
unfortunately a lot of times like in our situation of freshwater farms we are
in or we're surrounded by hemp fields and we're also surrounded by other
cultivated cultivation facilities and so it it became really apparent to us in
our first cycle that we were not going to be able to get away with a no spray
IPM that because the influx of bad guys was just more than we we could throw
bugs at that's an interesting idea the idea that you know if you were by
yourself over there that you would not attract nearly as many from all the
dirty ass farms around you yeah absolutely absolutely well you know and
I've got no you know no no problem with anybody else I think that there's just
kind of a natural thing that happens to you know you get that many cannabis
plants in one area they just send a signal out you know like the bugs just
know like oh in that building there's a bunch you know or there's a huge hemp
field so everywhere in the area they're just kind of migrating that way and they
just find their way into the facilities so during the first set we were talking
about water and how between all of the companion plants and the blue mats that
your water requirements are actually really low I wondered what your thoughts
were about nutrients because for folks new to companion planning it's a pretty
common pushback for them to say well you know my nutrients are really
expensive and I don't want them to be all taken up by the companion plants and
and and I get that I usually start with hmm what nutrients are you're buying
that are so expensive right but but to their point I was curious if you find
that to what degree the companion plants swipe nutrients from the cannabis plants
and so how does that impact your feeding sure that's a that's a good
consideration to have I mean I had the same thoughts when I was first getting
into this and I think I think we as a whole don't really understand the
vastness of what's available in the soil and and in a properly amended soil so
like in my situation we don't I know that Tad with keep it simple he always
recommends that we reamend every cycle and and I really value his opinion but I
I really hold fast to my minimalist approach and we do it every other cycle
and and we're still finding that even though we're waiting you know six months
we're basically a reamending our beds twice a year that there's plenty to go
around in that six months and you just kind of have faith you kind of have
faith in the in the process and the system and know that those those plants
they are there they are up taking some minerals and some nutrients but they're
also going to give it back in that cycling process you know and even if you
were cutting down your cover crop and then fermenting it and applying it back
to your soil as a tea you know you can you can capture all you can capture a
percentage of those nutrients that the plants took and give it back or just
allow the plant to give it back when it when you go through your die-off process
so going further down that line of thought you know when when when people
ask me about the nutrients that the companion plants take up and and it's
taking away from my cannabis plant what I normally tell them is if if you are
going to go to the point of having companion plants and to be feeding a the
whole bed a natural diet whatever you are out financially for the nutrients
that the companion plants are going to uptake you will end up receiving far far
more from the additional micronutrients and nutrients that are germane to the
soil that will be created because you've got all these additional plants and and
the mycelium that comes with it and they are you know all the additional microbes
so so you may be putting in some nutrients and those plants may be taking
them up but the symphony like you were talking about will actually cause far
more nutrients than you paid to put in the backs absolutely it's over unity
it's an investment you know it's just like in the old days when I used to own
a brick-and-mortar hydroponic shop in Southern Oregon and you know the thing
we would always say is you know you if you're in here spending $1,000 you
shouldn't feel terrible because that thousand dollars is gonna earn you
ten thousand you know so it's kind of a similar thought process you know what
you've got to sacrifice a little but in the bigger picture you know you get more
in the end so that's really really well put I like that so along that same vein
my favorite part of polyculture is the interplay of the roots of the different
plants right and and you know my science knowledge is is growing but I
would still call it somewhat limited so so as that assert it's like when when
you know people say any justifiably evolved technology is indistinguishable
from magic you know for me soil science still I since I consider myself still a
novice at a certain point I get down a level of a detail and then it's just
magic right so so one of my favorite parts is the interplay of roots and my
celium and the soil through the soil and the rhizosphere speaking you know these
these networks where they're they're moving around nutrients and they're
sending signals about pests that are on the other side of the bed and for
some because of some reason this the symphony as you put it it really seems
to increase the thriving nature of the entirety of the bed even though this is
mostly invisible to us so over time you know I know that you spend a lot of time
with your beds and you've got you know at this point decades of experience so
as the cultivator over time can you sense any of that activity below the
soil and since you're with them for such long periods of time yeah I mean without
sounding too you know starry-eyed you there's definitely there's something
that happens when you like when you feel like you've achieved homeostasis when
everything is just firing on all cinder cylinders you your plants and your
yours there's this kind of iridescence that happens with your plants the lipid
layers on your cannabis are thick and beautiful and and it's when you show
people pictures they're just like oh my gosh supreme health like it's that
feeling you get when you look at a plant that's just you can tell that it's had
its maximum genetic potential is expressed you know there's just a
feeling that happens and and I think that's what calls a lot of us to this
living soil process it allowed a lot of us to kind of put our ego aside because
it's really hard really to take credit for the cannabis that I've that I grow
in these systems because I literally don't do anything I literally plant them
in and observe I mean I'll lollipop all thin a little bit but I'm not in there
fussing over things and I'm not and I'm just observing in that and that's that's
when having the trust in the in the process and having faith in that magic
that happens because I'm not I'm no soil scientist I'm a high school graduate
and I went to I went to school for I went to trade school for audio
engineering so you know I'm pro tool certified I have no idea about the soil
science right I just know what has worked and from what my you know very
basic understanding and I think you know your actual soil scientists themselves
like dr. Lane Ingram and and low and fells they'll be the first ones to tell
you that we're only at they are only at a 10% knowledge of what's happening so
there's still a lot of magic that needs to be deciphered there so even though
that you say that you don't mess with it much and then earlier on you said that
that you're kind of past your days of bothering about pH because of how you
grow your pH is going to be correct and stable I'm curious where you fall I mean
how regularly do you test your soil this is something that I wanted to
tighten up on my regime at my home grow I've never tested my soil so my soil has
been in a tad has been really wanting me to get soil samples in just just to kind
of get the data because I've been I'm over three years on these beds and I
just have kind of like if the plants look like they're doing good I'm not
fussing about it but now that we're on this commercial level with freshwater
we're gonna start to implement you know at least twice a year soil samples and
soil analysis so we can kind of see what's being consumed what's being left
behind and then maybe move forward with kind of a more conscientious amending as
opposed to just kind of throwing a basic amending kit that's kind of got a little
bit of everything you know it's a soil analysis I think is crucial for data and
crucial for moving forward and keeping costs down and those kind of things
because now that we're not black market or medical you know we're really
concerned with cost of goods produced and all these type of things so analysis
and data is is crucial taking another step down this this science path you
know when when in medical days in each state before the heavy regulation and
taxing comes along we all had a lot more flexibility in our grow locations
and so places that I have worked in places that I have visited very often we
I would see two stations there would be a DAB station and then there would be a
science station and and and you know they'd have a rig on one side and then
they have a microscope on the other side so I was curious you know clearly you
know you can't have the DAB station anymore under under the new regulations
but but perhaps you are the kind of guy who keeps a a microscope station in case
you know maybe maybe to check out your bugs or whatever I think so I was just
curious if you if you keep a microscope in the grow we I have a like your little
USB 400 times scope that you see lots of folks have and I think that sometime in
the next six months to a year I'm definitely gonna be interested in taking
some actual courses on microscopy because Elaine Ingham has some really
good courses and I'd like to get into that because I think that that's kind of
that's the next level is being able that's why one of the reasons why I
don't like doing aerated compost teas because I just don't you don't know what
you're getting really until you can get in there and look at what you're
actually cultivating in that tea and so I've been hesitant to go down that route
simply because my skill set just kind of didn't didn't allow for me to know
exactly what was happening in the soil I think it's a very very valuable skill to
have and it's something that I'm definitely gonna be putting into my
future toolkit isn't it cool that so much what what I'll just throw in one
big basket and called soil science that this stuff is becoming so much more
available to all of us you know when when cannabis had to be you know in the
dark and in the prohibition days and even farther back when all we could find
was you know a column or two in high times magazines in the Stone Age right
nowadays though not only can we talk more publicly about soil cultivation and
soil science as it relates to cannabis but now like you know you you mentioned
Elaine you know you can you can take her classes you can take her online
classes there's a there's that great traveling science classes that Joshua
Rutherford is running what is that organic regenerative cannabis calm I
think but he's you know he's taking these soil scientists and you know you
know taking them across the country so people you know in Michigan and and Maine
can get the same kind of stuff too it really is a game changer I think from
everybody from you know the high commercial level who certainly needs it
but really you know so many patient and just you know enthusiastic homegrowers
are diving into the soil science which always brings me back to the idea that
that really cannabis cultivation is a you know is an entryway to all sorts of
horticulture you know absolutely yeah I I really love what Joshua was doing I
went to his first one last year in in Portland and he's got such a great
vision and really proud to know him and happy that he's doing that because
you're right this is a it's a very interesting time because you bet we have
a lot of people we touched on it earlier a lot of people that are just kind of
sick of the system as it is as it's been presented and are realizing that there's
a safer way to produce your medicine or to produce your cannabis and and not
have to sacrifice yields or or anything you actually it's a win-win you're
producing a safer higher quality medicine and it's and it's a better
product than you would otherwise and and in doing so I've seen lots of people go
from cannabis and now they've got hugelkultur veggie beds and and they're
taking this living soil idea and bringing it once again back to the old
days like this is how we grew you know before commercial fertilizers so that so
it's people just really reclaiming our past and there's this kind of maybe this
inherent nostalgia that happens you know when we when we participate in that yeah
I want to I want to go back and fix the the URL that I put out because I'm sure
that that Joshua is out there listening to this going you gave the wrong domain
because I wasn't planning on mentioning it so it wasn't in my notes but but it's
regenerative organic cannabis calm and so he's doing four or five of these that
are going across the entire u.s. and he's bringing people like you know Kevin
Jodri and laying Ingham with him across the country that's super cool so so let's
go ahead and take our second commercial break you are listening to shaping fire
and my guest today is Joshua Steensland lead cultivator at freshwater farms now
that the health benefits of terpenes have become well known in the cannabis
industry people everywhere are looking for the purest terpenes without
adulterants the problem with most terpene providers is that they're not
sourced naturally and instead are made as a byproduct of refining petroleum and
that's so sketchy the terpenes sold by true terpenes are
entirely different they are certified organic non-gmo and food grade that
means that they are extracted from real plant sources there are no solvents of
any kind they are distilled only with steam that's right only steam in fact
terpenes from true terpenes are so pure that you can eat them not only that but
you can stack them with better results too what I mean is other companies
terpenes have got a few percent of impurities and when you stack those
terpenes to make your blend you're adding a variety of impurities that
degrade your final product true terpenes also have strain specific terpenes
for a wide range of cannabis strains like Durban poison sunset sherbet and
granddaddy purple true terpenes has robust and supportive customer service
so your questions will get answered fast and efficiently if you shop for terps
before you know how rare that is so whether you want to cup your hands to
smell some beta-caryophyllene to calm down after getting too high or if you
want to dab some pinene so your lungs feel fabulous and your mind feels
liberated true terpenes will provide you with a truly natural experience if
you are a cannabis product developer these are the terps you want to add to
your oil or edible or capsule or whatever true terpenes are simply the
best your money can buy don't try and make a premium product with substandard
terps choose true terpenes for a top-shelf experience go to shapingfire.com

week's newsletter as a business owner you are incredibly busy in reality you
are responsible for everything your company does you've got so many
responsibilities every single day that often you just don't have the time to
really dig into your marketing as deeply as you'd like you know there's more that
you could do to reach out to new customers and encourage loyalty in the
customers you do have but you certainly don't have the time for it and you're
not really ready to hire someone full-time for that role either for you I
recommend blunt branding at blunt branding Kirsten Nelson and her team are
focused on improving your bottom line you know most marketing firms are
excited to make your logo packaging and website very pretty but they leave
responsibility for improving your bottom line up to you they don't want that kind
of responsibility but that's pretty much the most important part of marketing
right Kirsten and her team will help you engage new customers funnel them to your
point of sale whether it be online or storefront and keep them coming back to
you and telling their friends now if you happen to be a new cannabis company or
an established company moving from medical to adult use in your state
Kirsten especially can help you not only is she well versed in marketing and
finance but she totally gets cannabis whole plant medicine terpenes heritage
farmers and the particular needs of startups check out what she did recently
for Moon Time Medicinals in Humboldt County at MoonTimeMedicinals.com Kirsten and her team put together a whole brand package for them built their website and wrote their sales materials no doubt this is a paid commercial spot but that does not mean that they bought my opinion I've worked with blunt branding on four projects now for various clients and every single time they have done more than they've promised and over delivered on results I love how they generate new revenue and focus on that as the goal instead of just
making you a pretty logo similarly every single friend I've referred them to has come back to thank me that just doesn't happen every day grab a pen and paper because the website address is coming if you want someone to implement marketing programs that feed your bottom line give blunt branding a call they will share proven techniques to increase your audience and generate sales while using cutting-edge technology solutions in the background that make all of this easy automatic and trackable go to shapingfire.com

exceptionally popular and so would you just take a moment and explain a little bit about how you're implementing no-till in your four by eight beds and what your planting and harvesting processes look like yeah yeah yeah no-till has really become kind of a buzzword as of late over the past couple years so when I think of no-till I literally think of not tilling so you know
I try to when I plant my my crop plants my cannabis I will put them in the ground in as small a container as possible so if I can if I can take my cuttings in clone form as just rooted cubes or rooted cuttings I'll put those directly into my beds because I don't want to displace any of that soil that where we were talking earlier about the the fungal
components and the bacterial components we don't want to disturb that delicate system like if we had one gallon pots and we had 24 or 18 plants in a four by eight bed or even 12 in a four by eight bed you're displacing 12 gallons of medium that was in the beds happy doing its thing and you're just tearing it up and displacing it you know and and I think
ultimately that's not it's not the end of the world your beds will recover but I think over time there's this cumulative benefit that happens to really just allowing that soil structure to remain intact you know if you haven't disturbed areas of the bed for over three years you can imagine the the strength of that communication network that resides in there it's gonna be pretty vast
yeah it's like it's like oh we've got all this mycelium superhighways why on earth would we break that up and then start over every year when when we already have all that maturity in the soil
exactly
yeah so so okay so if if your optimum situation is just to create a little opening and put a bare rooted start in there how do you go about amending your beds without disturbing the soil
sure yeah I tend to just top dress and so when I am and I I once again I tend to under amend I know that it's been recommended that you do about 14 pounds of dry nutrients and minerals per four by eight bed I do about seven and so I do half of what's been recommended from Tad at Kiss and we've been doing quite well with that once again
and I just top dress top dress and maybe sprinkle it a little in and then what happens is the cover crop will kind of grow over it and the soil life just kind of pulls it in
oh that's interesting good wow hmm well that that actually uh speaks to my next question which was how do you actually do it because all right so let's say that today you harvest and you're going to start a new cycle in just a couple days what a lot of people do is is top dress and then kind of flood it with water to to cause the nutrients to soak in more but then you've got a really wet bed and so you need to let that even out a little bit
um but I like your idea that you are using uh less top dress over a wider area watering regular and then the idea that the soil comes up and and sucks it down you know it takes it itself right yeah that's that's kind of the the the visualization I have is like is that really just like the worms will make their way up to the surface they'll they'll know that the kelp is there the crab meal is there
they'll come up there they'll start to consume it the process of them making their way to the surface and then and then uh heading back down again is going to pull some of that down um and then just the natural the natural microbial activity is going to just break it down and and you'll get like a kind of a precipitation
so let's so let's so we talked about the the beginning of the cycle for no-till let's talk the end of the cycle of no-till so so what does your no-till harvest look like sure um it's just like any anybody else we I don't do I don't do a dry out or any kind of weird stressing um I shouldn't say weird because some people do it and they like it it's just for a living soil bed it I don't like to stress temperature stress the plants
because I don't want to affect the soil temperature and obvious for obvious reasons I don't want to dry out or over you know over stress that that soil microbiome so with no-till it's literally just cutting the plant right at the soil level and then proceed with your dry and cure um methods as normal and then after that is in my particular methodology in my minimalist kind of water only
um thought process and our methodology is we just will reamend at that time once we have no um cash crop in the bed at that time we've harvested then I'll do my reamending amendment if it's after the second cycle and then I'll let it sit for about a week before I transplant the clones in
um and that's just kind of to ease my mind I don't feel like the nutrients uh amendments that we use are necessarily hot or would or would be a detriment I just kind of like to give the soil time to acclimate to its its new influx of nutrients and minerals before putting the plugging the plants in
do you pull the root ball and plant in its place or do you plant beside the former root ball we plant beside the former root ball once again we don't want to disturb that kind of that that that delicate infrastructure in there and the the roots become worm food and they also uh leave air cavities in there for aeration and water to flow it's just a
uh really good thing to leave in your soil I always I just drove by a hemp field recently and they had 15 or 20 people out there digging the root balls of their hemp crop out and I was and piling it in a big pile and burning it and I was just like no what are you doing not only are you wasting man hours and labor you're wasting a valuable resource and you're depleting your soil they're just it pains me
yeah and if and if it was medical grade hemp instead of fiber hemp there's actually really valuable medicinal properties in those root balls as well what a waste absolutely yeah it's really a shame unfortunately there's just um still a lot of funky cultivation practices going around yeah yeah for sure so so I haven't done enough volume to have a an informed opinion on this
or experience when you plant next to the old root ball will that root ball uh break down and nutrient cycle back into the soil within one cycle or will it be there for a couple cycles
now the the delicate parts of the root ball will go away pretty quick as you can imagine so like the finer roots and whatnot those tend to go really fast and I would say that those are gone from after the first cycle and and I've never done
I've never sliced into my soil to look I mean it would be really interesting to kind of see but all I can judge is by what the the stem and stocky material that's above the soil line that I've left after clipping it's it sticks around and is visible for about six months but if you went in and touched it it would be spongy and you could break it apart really super easy so my guess is that the stuff that's below the soil
is long gone after your second cycle after the second cycle post harvest if the stuff that's
above that has access to air that tends to stay around a little more but if you touched it or it
was stepped on or anything like that it would just be nothing it would it would break apart to nothing right on right on so um in preparation for for chatting with you um you know I spent a lot of time on your youtube channel which is really easy to do
and one of the videos uh uh informs this next question you know raw inputs like kelp and crab meal
cannot be eaten directly by the plant and so one of two things either has to happen either
you have to purchase a pre-digested um you know nutrient in a bottle or you have to introduce
the whole kelp or crab meal or whatever and give the microbes time to digest it which will then be
picked up by the cannabis plant um what are your views on this which do you prefer and why well I
mean I clearly prefer the kind of the amending I don't like the plant ready soluble bottled nutrients
simply because you're not allowing the plant to regulate its own uptake at that point so when you
have a when you have a soluble plant ready nutrient it's the plant's just going to take
it up because it's it's designed to be absorbed readily by the plant and and it typically my
my very rudimentary understanding is that is that the root exudates play less of a part when
you're dealing with those kind of water soluble synthetics or even like a water soluble organic
nutrient that's just plant ready um this this came up because people there there was a question in
the community of whether uh no-till beds need to be flushed and so so this came about it basically
from that there's there's a a group of folks who think that all plants need to be flushed and that
because if you check the runoff of a no-till bed it's got three or four hundred parts per million
that that that means that it's you know your plants aren't flushed properly and and I think
that that's where that kind of video came from was me kind of addressing that aspect that you know a
a raw kelp is a lot is a lot different in the soil than a water soluble plant ready nutrient
and so I definitely am on the side of the fence that raw nutrients and minerals that you you allow
the soil biology to process and have their exchange with the plant you're gonna you're
gonna get a your maximum genetic expression your maximum terpene expression and that's just based
based on my experience I cultivated for 15-16 years with synthetic nutrients and organic bottled
nutrients and plant ready nutrients and the second I switched to living soil there was a
marked improvement the quality of the product was outrageously good and we and and it was I was never
turning back it makes a really good case too for not swapping out your soil every cycle too right
I mean oh my gosh you know uh you know in the older days it was like oh we want fresh soil
and and nowadays that seems so foolhardy because we spend all this time and effort building this
rhizosphere and all these healthy microbes and the mycelium everything and and then you throw
it out and you're like ah you know but nowadays you you know with living soil you not only are
giving your microbes say for example kelp but they may not process it all during this cycle
and so you might get some advantages from that kelp next cycle because you you've kept the same
soil absolutely absolutely and that's the other that's the other benefit of this kind of
this process is that you're allowing the plant and and in one of my youtube videos the no-till
talks series that I kind of did which was uh based on a lot of people just asking me to explain my
minimalist kind of water only approach and so I'd like to think of that
interaction between the soil and plant as this sacred union and so when the plant is interacting
with a healthy microbiome in the soil it's asking it's calling for only the stuff that it needs and
nothing more and that's that goes back to that why we don't have to flush is because it's not
overfeeding itself the plant doesn't have a capacity to overfeed itself it's a it's a highly
finely tuned mechanism in itself that allows it to to only ask for what it needs and only receive
that so there's never like an over it doesn't overfeed itself nitrogen ever so when you allow
that natural kind of process that was designed in the plant that it evolved in the plant and
you're not bypassing that I think that's the one of the contributing factors to getting plants that
so clearly are exhibiting maximum genetic expression you know their genetic potential
is fully expressed because you're allowing those little those little micro mechanisms in the plant
to play itself out I mean they're there for a reason when you put it elegantly like that it
really points out how you know the soil has an intelligence and a heart and and a strategy for
itself and and and mostly so long as we can set up the soil to succeed it will do its work
absolutely yeah so kind of changing gears a little bit I've seen from the fantastic freshwater farms
Instagram which unfortunately was deactivated but but we've got a new one we'll give you the
address for in a little bit but freshwater farms uses LED lights how what's your experience been
using LED oh boy I'll tell you what I was a really hard sell I've been an HID cultivator
from the beginning so over 20 years and I just had never had any personal experience I hadn't
seen any flowers grown with LED and having been a former owner of two brick and mortar
kind of indoor grow shops I am intimately aware of the vast quantity of snake oil that permeates
the industry and this kind of no R&D products that hit the market where the consumers end up
becoming the research and development so I was I was really really weary of stepping into this
realm and looking towards other large-scale cultivators that just simply never did that
haven't even to this to this date haven't made the transition because they're skeptical and weary
of the technology and that whether it has arrived or not so I was extremely extremely trepidatious
moving forward I had I looked to grow mouse I don't know if you're familiar with him he's kind
of a really popular DIY LED guy who's working with chilled LED now and he's I really value his
value his opinion and so I reached out to him when I connected with Mike at Freshwater Farms
you know when he was like we were discussing how we wanted to go about setting up this facility
and long story short he put me in contact with the current light company that we use now
lighting company for LED and it took about six months of talks and visiting places that were
using them and and just getting assurances from folks that I knew were using similar technology
and getting the results they were getting you know it was enough for me to move forward and try it
out so that being said we're really impressed with LED tech I think it's arrived you know we're
getting to the point where we have lights where you have independent spectral tuning abilities
you're allowed to tune your reds your yellows and your blue whites independently so you can
actually affect this how your plant grows the nodal spacing the lateral growth all those type
of things so there's a there's a bit of a learning curve for folks like me who's just used to hanging
in hid really high and letting it fly so there's there was a bit of a learning curve on my part but
I really think that you know that the chance for LEDs to kind of overtake the hid lights in the
industry it's not if it's when it's happening like where we're seeing we're seeing yields
you know that are you know three pounds two and a half to three pounds per 700 watts
of LED fixture you know which is pretty impressive and then it's we're not sacrificing
terpenes we're not sacrificing any of those things so I think I think as we refine our
abilities with the lights we'll start to they'll start to be a greater appreciation of what the
LEDs can do there's got to be some people out there who are begging that you name drop the
kind of light that you decided to use so do you want to plug your lighting phone oh yeah absolutely
we're going with the progrotech ev 700s they're a really great company and the light that they
have the fixture that they have in all of our research we went around and I'm not going to name
the ones that we didn't like but we saw and talked to many many LED lighting manufacturers
and they all seemed so cheap and they seemed so flimsy and this this unit from progrotech is really
durable sturdy it's completely waterproof uh you know there's a lot of a lot of benefits to this
fixture so I highly recommend people check them out all right fantastic so you know before we
wrap up Joshua I want to I want to give you a nice big open question uh kind of a fishing expedition
you know um I have folks with a depth of experience like you on the show and and sometimes
you know I can put together a question path like I did for today but but I'm really curious what
what did I not ask you what what what do you know that you are excited about that people in the scene
just aren't talking about yet and I'm not experienced enough to ask you so so I just want
to like you know open it up for you to say what are you excited about that we should know about
that you want to break down for us sure sure well I think that I don't think there's anything really
that you haven't touched on but I do think that um what I'm personally have been excited about over
the past six months or so is uh diving into biodynamic cultivation practices um and in looking
into that it's almost like a thinking of your soil thinking of handling your soils in a homeopathic
fashion so really very think very small powerful kind of it sounds starry-eyed again it's kind of
like you're dealing with energy almost more like so there's things like the horn manure and horn
silica where they take manure and cow manure and pack it into a cow's horn and it's specifically a
cow's horn they've tried to use other horns like goat and and ibex and it just doesn't have the
same effect they'll bury it for the winter and then what happens is this transmutation takes
place and you're left in the springtime when you dig these things up you're left with this ball of
rubbery humic material that's pleasant to smell doesn't smell like manure it's and it's a highly
valuable resource for your soil for your soil microbiology and you can use super small quantities
of this to revitalize a very large amount of area and and so the there's this horn manure
there's horn silica where they'll take quartz crystal grind it up put it into the cow horn
bury it in the summertime and then dig it out and then use it as a foliar application to help
maximize like if you have a in a cloudy day and you don't have don't have very much light it'll
help maximize the light that you do have and there's a lot of really good research validating
a lot of these things and that's just a couple of the inputs the biodynamic inputs there's a lot
of them and some of them are pretty strange when you get down into it but the science behind it is
really really interesting and there's a lot of people like wine producers that are switching
to this biodynamic cultivation because they've noticed the difference in their in their grapes
that they're more wild tasting and and the the more rich and the flavor profile is is very high
so i would like to kind of take this into the cannabis realm you know uh when the first part
putting the compost in the horn and burying it i'm like all right that sounds different and unique
but but i can see how there could be some subtle science that we haven't learned yet there but then
your second example you're like you know grinding crystals and i could almost hear like everybody in
the audience kind of together roll our eyes yeah but at the same time you know um uh i'm not so
cocky or full of myself that i think that i know all the ways that the world works right
and so if if people are getting um you know qualitative if not quantitative positive results
and lots of science supports the energetics of crystals well all right there's a whole lot of
things that science hasn't unearthed yet and maybe there's something to that but but holy smokes
right yo dude tell me about it i was hesitant to talk about it for that very reason because it
immediately puts you in this class of like starry-eyed hippie just kind of like you know well
that guy's really like you know he's on one or something but when you look into it steiner the
guy who developed this um was was no was no hack he really was a really intelligent man and he's
very gifted and when you start looking into uh some of this biodynamic stuff and you can get past
that kind of weird feeling this is like we were talking about earlier with the soil like what what
looks like magic to us there's science behind it we just haven't found it yet and so i think that's
what we're dealing with when we're talking about biodynamics now i'm no expert i'm just now starting
to kind of wet my whistle in that regard but it's wildly and insanely fascinating to me and you're
clearly a soil adventurer right you know so so this is this is novel and kind of weird and
potentially works that sounds like a recipe that like will totally attract you personally as a
cultivator absolutely so um the only thing that i had ever heard about biodynamic really up till
today i mean i see biodynamic on bottles of wine that's for sure but but you know you'll get people
arguing back and forth on forums like the probiotic farmers alliance on facebook and and and
people will talk about either popping their seeds or harvesting with different moon cycles and stuff
like that and and i don't i don't personally have an opinion one way or another because i don't know
enough to have an informed opinion but is that part of your bigger picture with attraction to
buy biodynamics are you are you popping seeds with the moon not not just yet i haven't drank the
kool-aid that much i mean i think i think that uh look the moon clearly has an effect on bodies of
water on the planet and and so the when you think about how it affects the tides you know and you
think that we are a very large percentage water the plants have a large percentage of water in
them it would stand to reason that if the moon is affecting large bodies of water like the ocean
with tides that there's some kind of effect on anything that that is water based on on this globe
so you know i can get with it i can i can i can see where they're going with it i just haven't
gone that far down the rabbit hole i think you can incorporate some of the biodynamic principles
without having to go that far into it in planting and harvesting according to um you know astrological
signs and whatnot but once again who are we to kind of say that there's nothing there you know
we just we simply just don't know we we can just shrug our shoulders and be like yeah that sounds
crazy but until we actually practically apply it if there's we we can't really formulate that
opinion what we do know is that there's lots of people who do utilize this lots of commercial farms
operate under these biodynamic principles and they crush it their their their vegetables and fruits
are routinely more nutrient and mineral dense than conventional even organic practices so there's
something there's some something that that's there that deserves a closer look right on that's
awesome i'm so glad that you were willing to go there with me joshua that was that was a really
interesting section so so before we sign off uh i want to give you props because uh it just came
out this week um we're recording this the the the week before emerald cup and uh one of your
photographs was while it did not win you got information that you were a finalist right
well i placed in the top 30 so it's really kind of a funny thing i saw that they were doing the
photo contest and i was like oh man i'll just i'll just throw something in and see so i really didn't
give it much thought i just picked a photo that i really thought was was great and sent it in with
no expectation of any acknowledgement whatsoever and they got back and said that i was in the top
30 out of a couple hundred entries so you know i was uh i was impressed i felt i felt humbled yeah
right well hey it's it's nice to get those kind of unexpected kudos man so so congratulations on that
so so joshua thanks so much for being on the show um not only do you have a wealth of experience but
