So here we are at episode 50. In some ways it feels like episode 104 because
before I started Shaping Fire I recorded 54 weekly episodes for my friends over
at gontrepreneur.com. But this episode is number 50 of Shaping Fire. The Shaping
Fire show is in its third year and some folks asked me why there are only 50
episodes which works out to about two or so a month. The long and the short of it
is that to make a quality show I can't just spit them out. For most of my guests
I need to read their research or their book or bone up on some aspect of
cannabis just so I can ask the questions that you most want to hear answered. If I
just asked generic questions the show wouldn't be particularly interesting. And
the number one piece of feedback that I get from folks is that they love my
lines of questioning. So I make sure I take my time when preparing a show. Also
as an interesting side note I went to college on a full debate scholarship so
that's probably where the question and answer skills come from. Also not only do
I like to take some time building a show but I'm out in the field constantly
learning more and meeting new experts to bring them to you on the show. I'm down
in California a few times a year hearing what farmers are saying and trying to
get introductions to hard people to reach like Caleb Inspecta who was
recently on the show. That interview took almost a year to bring together but it
was hella worth it. I also run my own test garden and spend the bulk of my
time working with cannabis patients and caregivers teaching them how to use
cannabis medicine and set up patient grows. It doesn't pay anything but it's
the most important part of all this to me. And while the podcast can now support
my basic needs through advertising I am still doing some brand strategy and
business consulting for select clients so I can afford the occasional vacation
you know. I think because I am involved in so many aspects of cannabis and am
not cloistered at home in the studio that it offers you a perspective that
you won't find anywhere else. But that also means this will probably never be a
weekly show but we'll see. And while I can finally live off the commercials on
the show you'll notice that I still don't have any bottled salt nutrient
companies as advertisers. While most of the industry is propped up by helping
sell salts there's no way I would take that kind of money while being such a
proponent of regenerative agriculture, polyculture, and organic cannabis farming
techniques. I'm doing my best to walk my talk. Similarly you may have realized
that I'm doing fewer shows on cannabis business now and more about cannabis
health and technique. Sure there are still shows about the industry because
I'm still interested in that and I'm still very much a part of that but you
aren't gonna find me doing a show about like track and trace software. The
content I am producing now is much more for hardcore cannabis enthusiasts than
it is necessarily for business owners though I love business owners too. It's
just that I'm more interested in the plant and the medicine than I am about
spreadsheets and regulatory changes. So as you'd expect Shaping Fire evolves
like it would over three years of the show. Thanks for listening the show and

Fire and I'm your host Shango Lose. Today my guest is veterinarian Dr. Gary
Richter. I had the pleasure of hearing Dr. Richter speak at Emerald Cup a while
back and have been excited to have him on the show ever since. Gary is a
holistic veterinarian and scientist with a practice in Oakland California. While
Gary cannot legally use cannabis in his practice, being in California means that
he had to research cannabinopathic medicine anyway just to answer the
questions of pet owners. He has become a national expert and is a sought-after
speaker and he's also a really nice guy. Today we're going to talk about in
detail the use of cannabis with pets and livestock. Welcome to the show Gary. Thank
you great to be here. So glad you could join us. So let's start at the very basic
because you know we talk about cannabis medicine on the show all the time and
one of the key aspects of cannabis medicine of course is that it interacts
with the human endocannabinoid system and often when we talk about cannabis
and pets people are often surprised that oh an animal has an endocannabinoid
system too and I generally explain to them that that you know all mammals do
to varying degrees and and people are surprised about that. When you talk to
people about the endocannabinoid system and their pet kind of explaining to them
how it works for the pet instead of the human how do you go ahead and explain
that to folks? Yeah that's a really good question I mean you know explaining the
endocannabinoid system can get can get tricky even when you're when you're
trying to explain it to medical professionals because you know remember
very very few medical professionals be they physicians or veterinarians learned
anything about the endocannabinoid system in medical school either but but
you know the way I approach it is is is you know the endocannabinoid system it
is a system of neurotransmitters that are present throughout the body both in
the central nervous system as well as in the rest of the body and and and while
we could talk for days about all of the various all of the various actions and
and physiologic responses that are caused by the endocannabinoid system the
overarching message is that the endocannabinoid system is designed to
promote what is called homeostasis which means balance within the body so whether
you know whether there's some sort of physiologic stress and illness and
injury emotional stress the endocannabinoid system can help balance
all of that out and keep the body on an even keel. That's fantastic and I think
it's interesting to the idea that that that the endocannabinoid system is
constantly bringing any system that is running hot or running cold back to the
center and I think that's interesting because people say how can cannabis
potentially help so many different things and I tell folks it only really
helps one thing it helps your endocannabinoid system it's just that
hat that happens to have its fingers and everything. Sure yeah I mean it's it's
almost like it's almost like when people talk about stem cell therapy and and
and stem cell therapy being able to treat this incredibly wide range of
medical conditions it's because it's because stem cells are really at the
root of of what cells can be in the body and therefore they can address so many
different body systems and and while endocannabinoids are clearly not stem
cells it is similar in the sense that the endocannabinoid system touches
almost every system within the body and therefore there is the potential to
utilize the endocannabinoid system and and phytocannabinoids to to positively
affect those systems. I think that in many cases pet owners are pretty darn
sophisticated and with access to the internet a lot of folks are doing their
research before they even go to the doctor's office. I was curious you know
when people come to your office and I know that you don't recommend cannabis
in your practice because of the laws in California but people constantly come to
you asking about it which kind of forces the question you know to be answered and
do you find that people generally already know that their their pet has
got an endocannabinoid system or is is that very advanced for just about
everybody you talk to coming in? You know what I think a lot of people that come
in while they may have seen the term endocannabinoid system somewhere either
on the internet or wherever they don't really have a firm grasp on exactly what
that means or how it applies but what they do know is that there is the
potential for cannabis as medicine to help their pet and while many of them
may not be concerned with the with the specifics in the science of the why they
certainly are concerned with what can I do to help my animal. Yeah you know
sometimes people will come to me and we'll be talking about pets and they'll
say you know I understand there's this thing called endocannabinoid deficiency
and you know they've often read Dr. Ethan Russo's papers about endocannabinoid
deficiency in humans and they're all like you know how do I tell if my my
animal has got endocannabinoid deficiency and I usually tell them you
know what there's not even tests for that in humans what do you tell them?
Well I that's that's pretty much the the long and the short of it I mean even
even for people I mean you know Ethan Russo's paper on endocannabinoid system
deficiencies which is a fantastic paper you know a lot of it is speculative you
know because we're really we're really at the very very early stages of
understanding the the more subtle nuances of how the endocannabinoid
system works and there's certainly no diagnostic testing on the veterinary
side to be able to measure endocannabinoid tone if you will. And that
actually kind of feeds into kind of a general theme today that we're probably
gonna run into a bunch of times which is these studies haven't been done yet and
so a lot of the insight that you're gonna be offering is is based on kind of
a combination of anecdotal evidence, your intuition, you know stories that you've
heard come back to you and and you know your very experienced hunches and
and I know that you know you you said that you'll point those out when there
are more hunches than anything but I think it's important for people to
realize real clearly up front that these studies generally have not been
done but people are asking so many of these questions that we decided to go
ahead and do an episode about it kind of like the this this the state of the art
like you know the best we know so far. Yeah you know and that's true and but
one other thing to mention is there's certainly a lot more clinical data out
there regarding cannabis as it as it affects humans from a medical perspective
and while clearly a person is not a dog nor nor a cat you know they are all
complex mammals and they all have an endocannabinoid system so while we may
not be able to necessarily you know draw direct correlations from one to the next
there's enough similarities here to where if we have reasonable scientific
data on the human side there is an expectation that we would see similar
effects on the veterinary side. Awesome yeah that's a really good clarification
there are there are a lot of very reasonable similarities and jumps that
we can make and we'll probably be doing some of that today so all right so now
that people generally have an idea of what we're trying to interact with in
the animals that we're talking about today I have I have taken the kinds of
animals and topics that that people ask me about most often and let's go through
them over the next you know hour or so and talk about each so that whoever's
listening their their particular animal with that particular issue will
hopefully come up and by far most everybody is talking to me about their
cats and dogs and I'm figuring that's probably the same for you and the number
one question I get is my domestic pet is getting old and their joints or
arthritis or they're just not they don't have the the same get up and go because
it hurts for them to get up and go and people are asking me all right so they
often come to me for the CBD and and then we often talk about the T we talk
about THC instead for the anti-inflammatory so when people are
talking to you about simple joint pain for a house pet what kind of guidance do
you give them or what kind of perspective do you set them up with well
you know as it pertains to cannabis that that happens to be one of the areas
where we do have a little bit of scientific data on the on the veterinary
side there was a study that was published last year out of Cornell that
looked at using CBD to treat arthritis pain in dogs and what they found was is
that is that CBD was in fact effective at controlling arthritis pain in dogs so
that is as I say it's one of the few areas where we actually have some real
data you know perhaps the the the bigger question or at least the other question
is is okay well if CBD is effective what about THC what about other cannabinoids
and that is something that we really don't know definitively yet although
again going back to the human literature we do know that THC or a combination of
THC and CBD can be very very beneficial to treat people with pain and and as
such it's it's probably reasonable to assume that similar things could be
could be experienced by dogs and cats now the so the the trick to all of this
of course is is is what product and what dose and that's you know that's
where that that's where the you know the rubber hits the road so to speak as it
as it pertains to sort of veterinary medicine or human medicine and and the
use of cannabis so that's something that you know as I'm sure you and your and
your listeners know really plays a huge bearing on the effect of any any kind of
cannabis preparation you know the varying either amounts or ratios of
cannabinoids terpenes what-have-you and that's that's that's really where we
need to be looking and where we need to be focusing yeah you know I often which
wish that I could speak to these dogs and cats that people come to me and then
they say oh we've got our dog and we we gave it just a little bit of THC based
tincture because it had joint pain and we were hoping for the inflammation to
go down enough that the dog can you know heck sometimes just go outside to to
defecate you know and and so people will give their animal just a little bit of
THC you know maybe maybe a milligram maybe a milligram and a half a very
very small amount and then and then the dog will you know you know you know get
up and kind of lumber around and seem like it's in good spirits and step out
and I'm always curious to know whether or not is this the dog experiencing
muscle relaxation and less tension of the muscles and less inflammation
somehow in the moment or is it just that the dog somehow is experiencing a
pleasant cannabis experience like so many of us have which kind of changed
their mood and caused them to get up because we try to anthropomorphize their
actions and and it's so important what the motivation of the actions are when
we're talking about dosing humans and the doses are so much more sensitive and
and lower for an animal it it it makes it very challenging to come up since
there's no studies yet yeah I mean it is very challenging but you know one thing
that we do know with dogs in particular is that dogs actually have a greater
number and a greater concentration of CB1 receptors in their brainstem then do
people and as such they are much more sensitive to the potential toxic effects
of THC then would be a human on a sort of on a per weight basis so what that
means is is that is that we do have to be very very cautious with the amount of
THC a dog gets now you mentioned like a half a milligram or one milligram of THC
now it kind of depends on the size of the dog you know for so for example for
a medium to a large sized dog probably a milligram of THC is not going to have any
any outward effects in a negative sense like the dogs not going to be high the
dogs not going to be experiencing THC toxicity but that said it's possible
that even at that low dose though you know that amount of THC could be
providing some pain relief could be providing some relaxation as you say I
mean it's very difficult to get any kind of direct feedback from a veterinary
patient so all we really have to go on is is how they're acting how you know
how they're moving around because you know from the dogs perspective there is
no placebo effect here now certainly as a human perceptual issue we we may read
things into it that aren't there and that you know that is a placebo effect
in and of itself but you know if the dog is unquestionably doing things that it
otherwise wasn't doing the only explanation for that is because they
feel better yeah yeah that makes sense and also you know kind of to relate that
to the humans and and we talk about this often on the show where people are
experiencing or they're looking for relief from something but they really
don't want to experience any level of you know THC euphoria or intoxication
and so we always tell people that you know take 2.5 milligrams four times a
day and you may never feel it but it's still at the those those clinical doses
still causing muscle relaxation and causing anti-inflammation it's just not
a high enough dose that you're getting anything in your head and and I think
that's that's exactly what you're describing for the veterinary patients as
well yeah you know that's that's very true as you know when I speak to groups
of pet owners or groups of veterinarians I mean I very frequently tell them that
that it is just like with a person it is absolutely possible to put an animal on
THC and have them not be high it's just a function of understanding how many
milligrams you're giving relative to the body weight and or species of the
of the particular animal that you're treating and and to go along with that
you know therapeutic dosing so so you know doses of say THC that have a
positive effect medically speaking do not have to be psychoactive doses
there's plenty of space in the in the in the therapeutic dosing window that are
well below whatever would cause psychoactivity in a human or an animal
and you can still get benefit from it I mean look at all these people that are
out there that are that are functioning members of society that rely on cannabis
you know to get through their day because they have pain or anxiety or
whatever it is that they may have you know those people are not walking around
high you know it's just that you you know like with any medication you have
to understand what you're giving and what dosage you're giving I think it's
important to to point out that while let's see how do I want to go into this
so I think I'm gonna start with the anecdote so over the course of my life
of using cannabis I have been in the presence of other people who have had
pets and at some point they got the the the pet high you know by blowing smoke
in their ear or whatever that you know I've seen happen and and at some point
the pet decided that it liked it so that so that when I'm over at their house and
and they light up the the let's say a dog the dog hears the lighter and so the
dog comes in the room and it's kind of begging for it I always found that to be
really extraordinary both because I did not think it was fun or funny to dose an
unsuspecting animal but since it had already been done and I was there and
the animal seemed to want more I found that to be a rather interesting data
point do you have any you know feedback from your your patients and their owners
about pets that have acquired a desire for more of it you know that's honestly
that's not something that I've really come across I mean I you know I feel
pretty strongly that that you know that kind of that kind of activity like
intentionally blowing smoke in your dog's face or something that I mean
that's that's not okay and in fact that that borders on animal abuse you know
partially because you know these animals are not equipped nor aware of what's
coming from a psychoactivity standpoint and also because you know what I mean
inhaling smoke is not necessarily good for anybody and it's certainly not good
for dogs and cats and if you know and if if if cannabis as medicine is something
that they benefit from and and one could speculate you know what if that
individual dog seems to seek it out maybe there's something that dog is
getting from it medically speaking you know maybe something hurts less or maybe
they just generally feel better and if that's the case then then you know that's
when it's time to investigate a more responsible use of medical cannabis
rather than what I would what I would describe as irresponsible use of
recreational cannabis. Yeah right on that makes sense to me so so we talked a
little bit about the potentiality for the use of both CBD and THC to decrease
you know pain and joint pain just general body aches of a older domestic
pet people have started writing online that they're using CBD to rebalance the
endocannabinoid system so their pets don't have allergies and and I've never
run into this ant with an animal before so I don't know how I would know that my
pet has an allergy what it's to and then to choose to treat it with CBD but what
do you what do you have in that category? You know of all of the things that I've
seen animals benefit from cannabis for I mean allergies is not it's not at the
top of the list you know you know as as we have mentioned I mean cannabis and
it's in its many forms it does have anti-inflammatory properties it does
have sort of overall immune system and body balancing properties by virtue of
promoting homeostasis as we discussed before I have in fact on a couple of
occasions seen topical cannabis products used on animals that seem to
have helped a little bit with itching and allergy so I think you know there
may be something there although like I say I mean you know you look at all of
the various things that cannabis is used for you know in people as well and you
know I mean treating allergies is you know it's not super high on that list of
things I think there are there are there are other options out there both natural
medicine wise and if necessary pharmaceutically speaking that probably
would work a little better. One thing I've seen for sure is when folks will
administer small amounts of THC to their you know domestic animal that for for
pain or something often they will get the munchies and you can just see them
go to town on on their food and and people are often overjoyed because like
oh my gosh the the animal had had so much it was in pain and they weren't
getting a lot of movement and they didn't even want to go over to their
food bowl and now suddenly there's movement and they just totally cleaned
out the bowl and so they they kind of help bring the pet back to health by by
leaning on what I'm assuming is going to be the mere scene in the in the THC
preparation. Have you seen that taking place in your practice? You know I'm not
honestly convinced that cannabis is is directly an appetite stimulant in
animals like you know from from like the munchies standpoint but what I think we
do see is because a lot of the animals that are receiving these medications
they're you know they're not eating or they're not eating well because they
don't feel good you know they feel sick whether they have an upset stomach or
they're in pain or there's something else going on I mean you know I think we
all know from our own health that when you you know when you feel crappy you
know going out and eating a bunch it's not necessarily always you know your
first priority and I think what happens with these guys is oftentimes we see
them eat better because they feel better so they're not they're not in pain
anymore maybe their stomach upset is is relieved and therefore they're gonna eat
more but you know like I say I'm not I'm not a hundred percent convinced it's
directly appetite stimulating in the sense that like people get the munchies
see this is another great question great place that we'd love to ask them
you know you'd really love to yeah totally so I ran into something new
recently someone using a myrcene dominant THC tincture with their pet
after surgery so they they had a pet that had normally has a lot of energy
and was gonna be jumping around and they did not wanted to give it a traditional
I don't know pharmaceuticals to dope out the animal after the surgery but they
were still concerned about the sutures getting ripped open or just give letting
them have the time to get over the trauma of the surgery and so what they
did is they they used this tincture and they intentionally got their dog a
little high but the dog seemed fine and relaxed and just kind of chilled out
around them for the next few days and then they you know then they stopped the
the dosing and the the dog kind of perked back up and went on its merry way
and you know outside of the the discussion that we've already had that
you've got to be really darn careful with dosing and we're gonna talk more
about dosing after the break what do you think about you know the use of a THC
tincture to kind of slow down or I don't know but incapacitate an animal so that
they can get through their more important healing you know it's a really
interesting question because because well like in my mind my immediate sort
of knee-jerk response was gonna be you know what that's a bad idea but you know
when I when I look at the when I look at the kinds of pharmaceuticals that we
typically use in veterinary medicine for just that purpose so so post-surgical
animals to keep them calm to keep them from being too active after a surgery I
mean effectively that's kind of what we're doing is we're intentionally
sedating the dog or the cat or whatever so they're not excessively active so you
know is giving is giving say like a pharmaceutical like trazodone is that is
that demonstrably better than somebody giving an appropriate dose of you know a
cannabis preparation with THC and mercine I mean honestly I don't actually
know the answer to that question that's one of those things that down the road I
think research would be really fascinating to start to look at like at
like physiologic parameters like you know heart rate and respiration rate and
pain you know pain response it'd be really fascinating to see if cannabis
you know can be appropriately used in that sense you know clearly it is going
to be extremely difficult if not impossible for a pet owner to get any
kind of guidance in that regards from a veterinarian so you know that as you say
that just it rolls us back around to that discussion of dosing and I think
that that's that's particularly important with this particular scenario
because now now we're talking about really getting up close to the line
between a therapeutic dose and what and what would be considered a toxic dose
yeah so so let's pick up this dosing conversation after the first break you
are listening to shaping fire and my guest today is veterinarian dr. Gary

the link in this week's newsletter cannabis is fun medicine and we love to
celebrate it cannabis connects people and creates
opportunities for new friendships at the toque shop we create custom cannabis
themed jewelry money clips rolling trays and home furnishings that you love and
they also make great gifts too I'm Ashley Villafranca owner of the
toque shop I came to cannabis as a patient seeking an alternative to the
pharmaceuticals being pushed at me for chronic pain and fibromyalgia I realized
that not only was cannabis a huge help in controlling my symptoms but I found
cannabis to be wonderfully social too cannabis makes friends so I took my love
of jewelry design and blended it with my newfound passion for cannabis and began
hand crafting bracelets earrings and friendship necklaces and then expanded
to money clips rolling trays and other home furnishings all made in sterling
silver 14 karat gold and aluminum so there's something for everyone's budget
I consider it all to be new age cannabis fashion and cannabis couture I invite
you to stop by my website at the toque shop dot co at the toque shop dot co

10 bucks and if you're fancy there are very fine luxury pieces as well and I'm
always happy to do custom orders with your name or a particular theme come
check out my array of items hand stamped with terpenes cannabinoids and other
cannabis themes that's the toque shop dot co thanks welcome back you are
listening to shaping fire I'm your host shango Lowe's and our guest this week is
veterinarian dr. Gary Richter so before the break we were talking about the
importance of making sure you get the dosing right and you know this is true
of humans as well because you can very easily move somebody from a dose that's
going to help them to an over medicated dose that's gonna have them you know
potentially upset for an hour or so and we never want to do that with animals
because they don't know what's going on to them and they trust us to take care
of them the best way that we can but it's hard because most people don't know
how to even dose humans properly and so when they're trying to apply the same
you know lack of experience to their pet things can get into trouble real fast so
Gary during the first set you were talking about how dogs have gotten more
CB1 receptors and so they they have a faster uptake of cannabinoids and I
often explain that to people it's like the difference between taking an edible
versus hitting a joint when you inhale a joint goes to your lungs and it goes
immediately in your bloodstream and hits you all at once and that's why you feel
stoned faster whereas when you take an edible or a capsule it takes a longer
time to be processed through your body and it comes on a little more slowly
well with what you educated us about earlier about the CB1 receptors and dogs
that tells me that we've got to be even more careful than I thought we needed to
be so when you're talking to people about figuring out dosing what do you
tell them when they when they're trying to weigh like how do I know how many CB
receptors my pet has got versus dog weight you know these are these are
unknowns at this point so how do you how do you help bring somebody through it
yeah you know I mean the I think the there's a couple of a couple of hard and
fast rules in this regards and and you know if I were say speaking with a group
of pet owners or or or educating veterinarians on on you know ways that
they can think about using cannabis in their practice you know the two things
that I think are important to remember as it pertains to dosing is number one
you know it's it all it's all about body weight it's all about the body
weight of the animal so you know it's interesting when you look at when you
look at dosing for humans very commonly in the literature you'll see you know
this drug X number of milligrams per adult human male or human female but
there's so much variability in sizes of adult dogs I mean you can have a 1 pound
Chihuahua or a 200 pound Great Dane so so knowing how much the patient weighs
is got to be step one and step two as as we often say even when it comes to human
medicine it is very much a start low and go slow kind of approach yeah so you know
we start them at we start them at a dose that that we know is going to be safe and
is very unlikely to cause any sorts of side effects and then slowly over time
we increase that dose until we get to until we either get to a therapeutic
effect that we're looking for or we've gone so high that we're now seeing side
effects that we don't like in which case we may need to think about a different
medication and that's why it's important to go slow because that you know if
you're gonna go step step step and like let's say that it's the fourth step
where you're starting to see adverse reaction you don't want to be taking big
steps so that there's a big adverse reaction you want it to be very very
subtle so that you can read your animals body language and then realize okay this
is this is our threshold point here and so again it's it's important what would
you call a a small step are you talking about increases of like a half a
milligram well again I mean you know it's it's it's hard to say on a per
milligram basis because it depends on the size of the animal so you know I
might look a little bit more from a percentage increase rather than per
milligram you know so probably you know a safe thing to start with would maybe
like like a 20% increase on a weekly basis and you know what people need to
kind of look out for is if as they're ramping that dose up if they give if
they give an increased dose and and the pet looks you know they look a little
glassy-eyed they look a little out of it they're sort of staring off into space
then probably that means we need to back off the dose somewhat. So Gary one of the
things that you know that that everybody wants to know is the exact dosage that
they need to start with and this is difficult right because nobody wants to
talk about it and and when I when I when I read places they don't want to go
to that level of detail so you've already spoken real clearly that there
are variations between a smaller pet and a larger pet but but there's got to be
some algorithm where we can get people to start because they're gonna do it
anyway so so what do you recommend? Yeah you know I mean that that is true and
that is that is invariably one of the questions that almost all people who
are looking at cannabis for animals have and quite rightly so. So you know to
start with as it pertains to dosing to start with CBD and and I'll start with
that because we actually do have some some research information here. The study
that I was mentioning a little bit earlier that came out of Cornell looking
at dogs with arthritis as well as another study that came out of Colorado
State University looking at dogs with epilepsy so treating seizures with CBD
both of those studies looked at dosages approximately of two milligrams of CBD
per kilogram of body weight twice daily. So you know as a doctor all of our we
sort of think in in terms of milligrams per kilogram when it comes to dosing but
what that really translates to in in plain English is about a milligram of
CBD per pound of body weight. So for example if you have a 10 pound dog
you're talking about give or take about 10 milligrams of CBD twice a day. Now
mind you if you're if you're familiar at all with with with with CBD dosing that
dose may strike you as high and and and in truth when I saw these studies
initially I kind of find that found that dose so seemingly a little on the high
side as well. I have seen a lot of animals do very well on much lower
dosages of CBD so it may be that that that even significantly lower dosages
can be beneficial but but as you know you know the the the margin of safety
for CBD is like a mile wide so so you don't you don't have a lot of concern
there from the standpoint of overdose toxicity that sort of thing. Now clearly
that's not the case when it comes to THC. So let me preface this by saying
that the dosing that I'm about to discuss is is is unfortunately not based
on any scientific research at this point. It's really a combination of
extrapolation from human research what I have seen work well in pets reports that
I've gotten from from other veterinarians from other medical
professionals etc but I think it's a I think it's a reasonably good guideline
and and the guideline from the standpoint of starting a THC dose for a
dog or a cat is going to be approximately 0.05 milligrams per
kilogram twice a day so that's 0.05 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
twice a day so again in plain English what that what that's going to translate
to is about a quarter of a milligram per 10 pounds of body weight so if you
have for example a 40 pound dog you might think about starting with a
milligram of THC twice a day and and as we discussed you know you can sort of
slowly ramp up from there but that should be a reasonably safe place to
start. So Gary of course that brings us to how do we actually get the dose into
the animal you know often I will recommend to pet owners to to use an
alcohol-based tincture because that goes through the skin so easily and following
the the the analytics on the label to dose them the proper amount on the skin
under the fur on the back of the neck and and I've heard some people do that
same technique but they'll do it with the ear because it's got you know very
soft membranes as well but in your role you are constantly teaching people how
to give their pets you know you know capsules or liquids or whatever they
normally need to take so how do you how do you advise people to actually get the
get them the cannabinoids into the animal which which who won't necessarily
recognize it as food?
Sure so you know I am I'm a big proponent of of cannabis infused oils
and I like them for a couple of reasons the first reason is is whenever you're
administering a liquid you have a lot of leeway as far as as far as dosing goes
so you know as we were discussing earlier you know if we're gonna go with
these sort of start low and go slow theory and we're gonna say okay well you
know increase by say 20% each week if you're gonna do that with a liquid it's
quite easy if you're gonna do it with some something that looks like a food
item like a dog biscuit or something you know 20% can be tricky you know it's
hard to break those things up into you know into sort of even portions and I
also do like to give the oils directly orally with the intent that hopefully
we're going to get a certain amount of transmucosal absorption so absorption
into the bloodstream directly through the mouth even prior to that medication
being swallowed and ultimately digested and absorbed through the gastrointestinal
tract so you know I think I think oral administration is is is certainly my
preferred method just to address what you were speaking about before what I
would call transdermal so putting it on the skin with the intent of being
systemically absorbed we don't have an enormous amount of information about the
efficacy of that but I can tell you that the the aforementioned study from
Colorado State University looking at epileptic dogs also looked at rates of
absorption of various methods of administration of CBD and they found
that the transdermal absorption was the most poorly absorbed preparation so so
at least preliminarily it may be that that you know that cannabis is not is
not super well absorbed in that way but if nothing else you know one thing that
I can say really just from my experience with other transdermal medications that
are used in veterinary medicine is at best absorption is is unpredictable from
one individual to the next so it's a little bit hard to tell how much is
actually getting in the patient. Yeah fair enough so if you are recommending
oral and and if I understand your vocabulary correctly you don't really
want it you know clearly we don't want to do like a preset dosed biscuit dog
biscuit or something or animal whatever but but we do want to use an oil but
you're also saying don't take a pre-measured amount of that oil and
apply it to the dog biscuit you regularly give them I think you're
saying just put the oil in their mouth is that what you're saying? I mean I
think in a perfect world yes that's what I'm saying now you know I mean that's
all well and good but I mean if an animal is just bottom line not amenable
to being medicated that way then by all means feed it to them put it on food put
it on a treat it's not you know it's you know these things are not it's not black
or white you know I think if we're looking for the most efficient means of
absorption directly orally is probably a good way to go and you know and I think
that that you know I think that that speaks a little bit to the conversation
of if you get the right preparation for the individual dosing becomes really
easy because let's say that if I'm going to dose some given dog and based
on the concentration of the medicine that I have the doses two or three drops
of oil I can put those drops of oil on my finger and just lift up a lip rub it
on his gums and I'm done I see so you know but you know if you get a person
and you have to give like three teaspoons of oil then yeah that's gonna
be a problem right on and it's always important I think when when just like
interacting with human patients when you have an animal patient they have got a
life experience too and and we want to make sure that we create a a healthy
experience for them so they don't want to resist being handled and medicated and
and who knows you might have an experience like we talked about earlier
where the animal realizes that after I get rubbed with this oil on my gums my
pain decreases they may end up being like all in like I'm in favor of this
you know that that may in fact be true though the the one part where it may not
work out as well as we wanted to is is is while dogs and cats are certainly
very attuned to a cause-and-effect relationship it may be that the effect
is far enough down the road from the cause that they don't connect the two
you know if they don't feel better for like a half hour they may not connect
that to when we put it in their mouth yeah fair enough fair enough so let's
let's take this to the far end of the scale right because at the far end of
the scale we've got animals with cancer and for folks who do not understand
what a typical human cancer protocol is it's taking 60 grams or or technically
milliliters of this cannabis oil a commonly known as Rick Simpson oil or
ethanol hash oil but essentially it's a it's an ethanol extraction of the oil
from the plant very concentrated and and a human will take 60 milliliters of this
over 90 days and that is an extraordinary amount of cannabinoids and
just about all the patients find that they sleep through the majority of the
time because it's so it makes you so lethargic you know there are certainly
people who will be taking these high dosage and and it actually is a buoy to
them they're actually feeling better and and more lighthearted and they don't
sleep but that's that's really uncommon normally people are lethargic and and
they sleep most of the time but the problem is that when people are getting
up they when they're titrating up and and going to an higher higher dose every
third or fourth day sometimes you get nausea from the higher dose or or like
any kind of dysphoria that people will sometimes have when they take too much
THC and so people will say okay I know that I that that humans are taking a THC
preparation for cancer and my dog has got a tumor or some other form of cancer
and so I want to do that for my dog too because they have an endocannabinoid
system and so the problem though is that when you're working with a patient the
patient is giving you very clear feedback about how they're feeling and
we are dealing with high dosage so that feedback is incredibly important when
we're doing this with our our you know house pet we are way closer to
cannabinoid toxicity levels by trying to do in high enough dose that is actually
acting as a as a cancer cure because this is way more of a dose than just
helping them with joint pain but the but the animal can't give us really
quality feedback to know if they are getting paranoid or getting upset or
getting nauseous or any of these things and it makes for a very difficult
situation and yet I'm regularly hearing from people who are buying syringes of
ethanol hash oil putting it in capsules and giving it to their animal to try to
help with their tumors I think that there are so many ways for this to go
wrong what has been your experience well that is that is an accurate statement
there are so many ways for this to go badly you know first of all if anybody
you know if anybody has ever had the experience of eating too many edibles
you know you can start to get an idea of what kind of effects that we're talking
about I mean you know overindulging on edibles is not a good time for anybody
and if you've ever seen a person on one of these cannabis protocols for cancer I
will tell you that it is brutal yeah it is not fun for these people but you know
what I mean if it's something that as a human if that's what you've signed up
for then you've made that decision and you understand why you feel the way that
you do and that's all great that said we cannot do that we can't do that with
animals and you know I mean you know there's a couple things to say I guess
in that regards first of all you know just just from it from an oncology
perspective so from a cancer treatment perspective you know there's a little
bit of a different philosophy when it comes to when it comes to animals versus
people so for example if a person has cancer and and they go to their
oncologist essentially their oncologist's mission is to keep their
patient alive no matter what and sometimes that means damn near poisoning
them to death in the process when it comes to veterinary patients when it
comes to animals nobody wants to put an animal through that kind of chemotherapy
and as such the goals of of oncology when it comes to animals is not to
preserve life at all costs it is to preserve quality of life so I think
that's the first thing that we have to we have to really sort of pay very close
attention to is is you know what I mean it's cancer and and just like with
people you know a lot of pets unfortunately are going to ultimately
succumb to cancer and the best thing that we can do for these animals is to
give them good quality of life for as long as we possibly can so having them
uncomfortably stoned out of their minds for the last weeks or months of their
life is is is really is really not a good way to go to speak to the specific
preparations I know there's a lot of people out there that are buying Rick
Simpson oil and other sorts of super concentrated cannabis oils I would
highly highly advise against giving any of those products to animals and the
reason why I say that is because those products are so concentrated that it is
functionally impossible to accurately dose so we talked a little bit earlier
about dosing you know on a on a milligram per kilogram of body weight
basis or a milligram per pound of body weight basis you know when you're
talking about something like Rick Simpson oil that is so concentrated that
a grain of rice by 10 20 50 milligrams of THC and let's say your dog's dose is
one milligram of THC there's no way you're going to be able to sort of
accurately dose that and and you know again from a from a doctor's perspective
a grain of rice is not a dose you know yeah you know I mean you know my you
know my immediate thought is always like what kind of rice is it long grain is it
short grain is it Basmati rice I mean you can't you can't you can't dose
medicine in this way I mean if you're gonna call if you're gonna call cannabis
powerful medicine which it is then we need to treat it in the in the same way
that we would any other you know any other powerful and effective medicine so
to kind of just sort of bring this in for a landing I guess as it pertains to
dosing cannabis for cancer oftentimes the goal with these animals is to ramp
them up to the highest dose that we can get them on and have them still feel
okay and feel functional you know remember that just like with people dogs
will develop a tolerance to the psychoactivity of THC over time so over
time you can get them on much much higher doses of THC then you will be
able to give them on day one and I will tell you that I have seen dogs with dogs
with cancer on doses of THC that if I were to take it I would be under the
covers for three days so you know they can develop a tolerance just like people
can but you got to do it slowly and you really just don't want to push it any
further than they can handle right on thank you Gary this is this has been a
great set I'm really glad to be able to get this level of specificity on dosing
all together and in one place so it's time for us to take our second short
break and be right back you're listening to shaping fire and my guest today is
veterinarian dr. Gary Richter did you know that shaping fire has a fabulous
YouTube channel with content not found on the podcast when I attend conventions
or speak or moderate panels I always record them and bring the content home
for you to watch the shango los YouTube channel it has world-class speakers
including Kevin Jodry of Wonderland Nursery talking about breeding cannabis
for the best terpene profile Nicholas Mahmood on regenerative and polyculture
cannabis growing dr. Sunil Agarwal on the history of cannabis medicine around
the world Ben Cassidy of true terpenes on using terpenes for health in your

forward slash shango los or click on the link in this week's newsletter as a
listener of shaping fire you already understand the importance of living soil
when growing cannabis when you have active microbe communities in your
substrate you go way beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and
potassium having active microorganisms in your substrate supports vigorous
plant growth throughout the plants root zone making for higher yields and
thriving flowers mammoth pea is the first organically derived microbial
inoculant that focuses on your plants nutrient cycling processes to release
soil phosphorus and other micronutrients from their bound forms making them more
available to the plant increased levels of phosphorus will also keep inner nodes
shorter and focus your plants energy on bud production not only that but the
microbes act as a defense shield for the plants rhizosphere by out competing
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes pretty cool right mammoth pea not only
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but it also helps protect your plant from
disease mammoth peas beneficial bacteria act like micro bioreactors
continually producing enzymes that release nutrients mammoth pea was
developed at a US University has been extensively tested by Colorado growers
and independent laboratories mammoth pea is proven to increase growth and
enhance blooming one of the great things about supplementing with microorganisms
is that they won't compete with whatever fertilizer program you're already
running simply dose on top of your fertilizer schedule for increased
benefits to learn more and to find out where you can buy mammoth pea near you

listening to shaping fire I'm your host shango Lowe's and our guest this week is
veterinarian dr. Gary Richter so so far in the show we have talked a lot about
your typical domestic pets your dogs and your cats but you know I live rurally on
an island and a lot of you have got livestock and other types of animals too
so before we wrap up today I think it makes sense to talk with some of those
so so Gary let's start with really small non dog and cat animals clearly
because they don't have endocannabinoid systems we take lizards and snakes and
things like that out because they're they're not mammals but but let's talk
about for example bunnies bunnies are very common and they become pets very
quickly and become a house house rabbits and I'm familiar with people using
cannabis with their bunnies as they get older and you know they want to help
them bring back their hop a little bit so so what do you think about about
small mammals and the difficulty with dosing them at such a low amount before
we get to that let me just let me just make the point that reptiles do have
endocannabinoid systems as far as we know oh I did not and in fact you know
the endocannabinoid system is fascinating in the sense that that you
know if you look at the the types of animals that have an endocannabinoid
system evolutionarily speaking you're going back millions and millions of
years I mean there are there are marine invertebrates that have an endocannabinoid
system Wow so so so I mean most complex animals that you can think of have some
form of an endocannabinoid system of course you know that doesn't mean that
it works exactly the same way as it as it would in a mammal but but you know
from an evolutionary standpoint it is it is it is pretty well ingrained in the
animal kingdom now to get to your question about about small furry things
like bunnies and whatnot the reality is is we don't really know pretty much
anything as it pertains to as it pertains to dosing on these sorts of
things you know I can tell you that that you know sort of the digestive
tract and the metabolism you know of a rabbit or some other you know sort of
small furry animal like that is pretty drastically different from that of a dog
or a cat so it's probably not applicable to just sort of downsize the dosing
accordingly per body weight you know as a rule you know a lot of these animals
are significantly more sensitive to pharmaceuticals then then then say would
be a dog or a cat on a per pound basis so odds are the dosing is actually going
to be lower than people might think you know I think from a safety perspective
you know if somebody had like an arthritic bunny or a bunny that had like
back issues or something they could try a little CBD I think quite safely and
see if that helps I'm not aware of any medical issues that that have come up
as far as that goes with regards to something like THC like I say I mean
there's just there's just no information out there to even have a even have a
clue about where to start from a dosing perspective so let's go the other
direction so I live on an island that is very equestrian heavy and there are
there are horses everywhere and people see THC and CBD being used in other
animals and so they're they're looking to deploy THC for you know for injury
for everything we pretty much discussed talking about using it for for dogs and
cats earlier they're starting to cross apply to horses and people are starting
to experiment with high doses of CBD to to keep horses calm but these are huge
animals with a pretty significant different kind of system right down to
how they how they process their nutrition what are your thoughts on on
using THC and CBD and the other novel cannabinoids on these these larger
livestock animals yeah that's it that's a really great question and again I mean
there's there are there are people that are starting to look at those issues I
mean I can tell you just you know from a from a pharmacology standpoint horses on
a per pound basis usually take far far less medication to be effective than say
what a dog or a cat so the dosing is is is very likely a lot lower than people
would think that it would be you know I do know that there's some people out
there that are starting to look at the use of CBD and horses again we don't
really have any any published or even very much anecdotal data out there as
far as you know specific doses go you know certainly one thing that I would
urge extreme caution with as it pertains to THC and an animal like a horse is is
you know potentially causing even mild THC toxicity and a horse I could I could
foresee as being a very very concerning thing you know from the standpoint of
you know horses as you probably are aware are fairly fragile creatures and
you know if a horse would you know got a little too much THC and lost their
footing and fell I mean that literally could be a life-ending event for a horse
so you know that's something I would certainly urge extreme caution and if
people you know if there's horse people out there you know they may actually
have a little bit more information than I do because because that's not really
so much the world that I live in but but you know I would I would definitely urge
urge extreme caution and taking things very very slowly and not only could it
potentially put the the horse or other livestock at at risk but also I mean we
all know how dangerous a horse can be when it is spooked or ornery and if it's
having this experience that it's never had before and it's feeling unsafe Wow
it could it could hurt the people around it and it could hurt itself against
against things that are nearby yeah I agree I mean it's you know I'm not I'm
not I'm not gonna say that it's it's something that should never be done
because again it's a little out of my area of expertise but I mean it's
something that that should be done under veterinary guidance and very very
carefully right on I think that's a good point for us to say you know we're
pulling so much of our experience from from anecdotes and from personal
experience of people doing this on the animals that tend to be most commonly in
our lives right dogs and cats and and as we as we work our way out to smaller
animals like rabbits and larger animals like like horses and cattle the the
number of data points that we have even anecdotally get less and less and less
and so if you're working with animals at either end of the scale don't think that
you can just take the the dog or cat dosing algorithm and just apply it to
these other animals right yeah you're absolutely right yeah so let's have it
let's have a little discussion about topicals for these animals because
topicals are nice because they generally keep the dosing pretty low and certainly
CBD topicals for for you know psoriasis and dermatitis and these these other
types of skin issues certainly are great for animals my question which is pretty
basic is how do you use a topical with an animal with fur well it's tricky you
know it's tricky for two reasons the fur is certainly one of them and you know if
there was an area of skin that that you know seemed like it really warrants a
topical that it may be that that area needs to be shaved because otherwise I
mean I think you know I think a topical would be would be difficult I have seen
some products out there that are essentially just alcohol extracts that
are that are packaged as a spray so it may be that you know you might be able
to you know get good skin contact with a spray even without shaving you know
and there are certainly endocannabinoid receptors in the skin and the hair
follicles so I mean I think there's absolutely medical application there the
flip side of it the other thing that we have to be concerned about is that you
know what anything that you put on an animal skin is likely to get licked off
and that's a real issue particularly if you're talking about a topical product
that has THC in it because again now we have to think about well how many
milligrams of THC is this dog ingesting because they're licking this stuff off
and is that a concern from a from a toxicity standpoint so it may be that if
people are using topicals particularly ones that have THC in and they're gonna
have to put like you know like what we call an e-collar like the lampshade if
you will something on them to prevent them from turning around and licking
that stuff off so Gary before we move on to talking a little bit about new pet
nutrition I do want to point out that that there's not any quality standards
that are enforced for for pet medications and there are a lot of folks
that are in the you know in the green rush that are bringing cannabinoid
isolate products to the market and as we've learned with humans it's very
important to use a whole plant preparation because these individual
molecules say for example CBD which is short for cannabidiol a lot of people
put out products that are just that individual molecule in some kind of
vehicle and there then they suggest that it might work just like all the studies
say and yet the vast majority of the studies are all focused on whole plant
preparations meaning you do a whole plant extraction and you not only have
the cannabidiol there but you also have the other novel cannabinoids that the
the cannaflavin and all the other parts of the cannabis plant that that are
found in the in the trichome oil there also and they work together to do what's
called the entourage effect they work together as a as a complex lock that
unlocks the endocannabinoid system well unfortunately there's a lot of people
who are bringing products to the market that are just these individual molecule
isolates and so my question for you is do you find that whole plant
preparations are preferred for animals just like they are for humans you know
that's a it's a really good question and and you know that is certainly that is
certainly something that certainly something that comes up a lot because as
you say I mean there's a lot of people out there that are looking to make money
in the cannabis industry and and you know certainly CBD isolates are are
certainly one of the things that are out there you know I am in my office I
practice what I would describe as integrative medicine meaning that I I
offer both conventional Western care but also holistic and natural medicine and
and we use a lot of herbal preparations in this office both Western herbs Chinese
herbs what-have-you and and as such I am a very big fan of of the entourage
effect and of whole plant extracts in my experience I find that those products
tend to work better usually then then isolated compounds and I think that this
kind of plays out a little bit if you look at for example if you look at
reports from people who are who are taking medications like Marinol which is
synthetic THC so that's basically just pure THC isolate that was that was
manufactured synthetically molecularly speaking it's the same THC that you
would find in cannabis it's just that there's nothing else there and very
frequently those people will report that whole plant cannabis tends to work
better for them than just the THC isolate so I mean I think that I think
that it bears out that these isolate products you know speaking in
generalities do not work as well as a really good quality full spectrum extract
very good so one thing that's interesting about folks everybody and
how they acquire endocannabinoid deficiency we generally suggest that
unless you're predisposed to it people generally get endocannabinoid deficient
from from stress and anxiety and poor sleep and poor nutrition and
environmental toxins and things that generally run the body down to a point
that it's not making its own endogenous cannabinoids effectively anymore and
then we go and supplement it with phyto cannabinoids from the plant but I know
that you are an expert also on on pet nutrition and I know we're talking about
a lot of different animals today right but but I think that one of the key
things is that if people put the care into the proper nutrition of their
animals that even if something goes wrong their their body is more likely to
bring their endocannabinoid system back into balance and and and thus the other
systems back into homeostasis all on its own so outside of the use of you know
supplementing with cannabinoids what's a perspective that you would offer to
people who care for their animals just so their nutrition is high enough that
endocannabinoid deficiency is less likely sure so just to speak to
endocannabinoid deficiency specifically I mean that is a that is a very very
difficult if not impossible thing to really prove in any given individual so
it's a it's a very difficult thing to it's very difficult thing to quantify
that said you know you can't have good health without nutrition you know
without without appropriate nutrition and you know I mean no matter no matter
what kind of supplements no matter what form of cannabis a patient may be taking
if they're not eating right then they're probably not going to be healthy and that
you know I mean that's that's always the first conversation I have with anybody
that brings their pet into my office is is is what what ideal nutrition looks
like for their pet because that's got to be the foundation to everything and so
so what do you is there a general guidance like what I'm kind of like
poking at is do you recommend that that people give their animals like whole
foods that they that they you know go to the extent to to make them meals are is
is is an animal chow sufficient I don't actually have an opinion on this I'm
just curious along with probably a lot of the listeners gotcha so so I am very
much a proponent of fresh whole food diets so you know the bottom line is is
that no animal or no person evolved eating highly processed foods you know
so you know our bodies are not particularly ideally equipped to to eat
things out of a can or out of a bag so so you know my preference is always to
have my patients eating eating fresh whole food diets now whether those diets
are raw food versus cooked food that that they've purchased from a company
that makes it or if they're making food at home using an appropriately balanced
recipe you know any of those things any of those things are fine but but you
know as is the case with all of us the fresher and the more whole foods they're
eating the better off they're going to be right on so you know mostly we've
been talking about using cannabinoids today as as a solution something's wrong
but what do you think about using cannabinoids as a preventative like your
your animal already is healthy and yet we know that THC prevents cancer long
term and we know that supplementing the endocannabinoid system with cannabidiol
is generally good for health what do you think about giving supplementation with
cannabinoids even if the patient is not presenting a problem you know what I
mean I think what we're really talking about here is micro dosing and and the
truth of the matter is is I don't know I don't know that anybody really knows in
the sense of you know as we've discussed I mean we have so little research as far
as as far as use of cannabis to treat known disease you know using cannabis as
a preventative is you know I mean I think it's I think it's an intriguing
question but I have I just have nothing to offer by way of is that a good thing
or a bad thing well that fair enough fair enough on that well dr. Gary Richter
