It was the summer of 2017 when I first experienced auto flowering cannabis.
I was standing in the fields with Seth and Eric Crawford of Oregon CBD seeds
looking at gorgeous and fabulously smelling acres and acres of cannabis
that was ready to harvest in the beginning of September. My regular plants
at home had another six weeks left of flower. Six weeks that would leave me in
the face of October rains, but these fields in front of me were finished and
ready to be cut and dried. That is when I first understood the potential for auto
flowers. Then in the summer of 2018 I grew my first auto flower seeds and
spent the entire run realizing the major impact that these seeds were gonna have
on home growing and the industry as a whole over the next 10 years. Finally
solid cultivars of auto flowers were available and I knew that home growers,
patients, and some commercial growers were going to be astonished when they
had a chance to trial them. By September my auto flowers were out of the ground,
dried, and in jars well ahead of the rains. My regular photo period seeds were
in the greenhouse still and preparing for the harsh October cold. Then at
Emerald Cup last year I found myself standing with Jeff Lowenfels chatting
about how I thought autos were gonna change the face of home grow. And Jeff
smiled and said that he agreed and that in fact as a gardening columnist for
over 40 years he saw auto flowers as the new tomato plant. That these new auto
flower varieties were the threshold moment where cannabis cultivation made
the crossover to regular folks. And that Jeff had written a book about them. Jeff
and I each looked at each other like we shared a secret that was going to excite
everybody. I went home and programmed an entire year of auto flower content for
2019. A shaping fire live on auto flowers at Cultivation Classic, a Vimeo
meeting focused on auto flowers for cannabis patients, a standing room only
presentation on auto flowers I did at Indoexpo, and a slew of videos helping
shine some light on auto flower breeders and to get the message out that auto
flowers had grown up. This episode of shaping fire is the last of the auto
flowering program I put together for 2019 and it's beautiful because it
brings me full circle to where I started this cycle with Jeff. If you want to

listening to shaping fire and I'm your host Shango Lose. Today my guest is
gardening columnist and Lord of the roots Jeff Lowenfels. Jeff has been an
award-winning gardening columnist for over 40 years. He is a recovering
attorney who fell in love with plants. He is author of the seminal teaming series
of teaming with microbes, teaming with nutrients, and teaming with fungi. His new
book DIY auto flowering cannabis an easy way to grow your own comes out today.
Today Jeff and I are going to talk about how auto flowers are going to
revolutionize home grow. Welcome to the show Jeff. Always a pleasure to be here.
How are you doing today? Oh it's absolutely fantastic here. We've been
getting a lot of rain here which concerns everybody who's growing in the
Pacific Northwest. We've gotten three days of sun so everybody's sitting in a
little bit of false hope. Yeah well hopefully hopefully it'll come true. Yeah
totally and that actually that'll play into today's topic really well. So
congratulations on your new book out today on auto flowers. I am so excited.
It's such a such a departure from what I normally do but it was it was just one
of those things I just felt I had to do and so it's out today. You can get it on
Amazon. You should be able to get it at bookstores. We'll see. I don't know. It's
hard to say what the distribution is going to be. You never know. It's a
cannabis book and of course there's still that stigma you know but but
people people who've taken a look at this tell me that maybe this book's
gonna help lift that stigma a little bit so we hope so. Let's see. Well as
someone who's already had an opportunity to read it I think it's fantastic. I
think it not only will increase or decrease the stigma but increase the
number of people dabbling in cannabis which is which is really fun right
because up to this point you've had to have a certain amount of chutzpah to get
into cannabis and to grow it either because it was illegal and you're gonna
have to go through all this hiding stuff or if it was legal in your state to grow
a few plants you had to feel especially confident in I don't know in your right
in your right to do that right because even though something might be legal to
grow you still might get shamed by your family or neighbors or whatever and so I
think your your book helps create support for those people who just want
to grow plants. Really and that's that's really the genesis of the book you know
me I'm so-called Lord of the Roots I write books about soil and and you know
the science behind how things grow organically and and all of a sudden
here's a book on auto flowering cannabis maybe I ought to mention the name it's a
DIY auto flowering cannabis a new way to grow and so so why did I write this book
you know it's not a one of these crazy things it just doesn't seem to be in
character what people don't know is that I also write a garden column and I
was invited to speak at the Garden Writers of America oh gosh it must have
been six or seven years ago and and it was the first talk on cannabis that this
organization's had these are the radio people the TV people and newspaper and
magazine people etc you know and so I gave this talk about how I thought
cannabis was the next tomato and and the talk was fine and people walked away
with a lot of excitement about CBD but it didn't have the impact that I that I
was hoping it would have because I really I really think that cannabis is a
fun plant to grow I know it is a fun plant to grow anybody who's tried it
knows it's a fun plant to grow it can be a little challenging but it's a great
plant to grow and if you're a gardener and you like horticulture this is a
terrific plant well you know one of the reasons it didn't take off as a subject
is because these plants are hard to grow that they require a tremendous amount of
space to start with and most gardeners don't have a lot of space they're in a
condo they have a deck you know they have a small vegetable garden when you
say when you say these plants you mean traditional cannabis plants right yes
exactly exactly so that so that's why one of the reasons why I don't think
garden writers took to this the second reason is is that these plants require a
photo period in other words as anybody who's grown these plants know they have
to have the traditional plants they have to have more than 12 hours of darkness
before they will begin to flower now that causes very little problem in lots
of places but in many places particularly northern hemisphere places
and I guess if you're on this south of the southern hemisphere places you don't
you don't get that period of darkness until things begin to get very cool so
if you live in Anchorage Alaska on September 21st when we have 12 hours of
daylight and 12 hours of darkness we also usually have a frost well you know
it takes another six or seven weeks for that plant to flower and those flowers
to develop etc so it's very hard to grow cannabis and I and I became convinced
that's why it wasn't taking off in states where it was legal lo and behold
my good friend Tom Alexander the very same guy who told me about the the
fungus protecting a tomato root from a nematode trying to attack it which
started my whole adventure into the soil food web and began the whole series
of books and everything else shows me some plants that he's going called
auto flower plants now you know we all know about all the flower plants we've
heard about him before they were discovered you know and bread and
finally in around 1970 or so people started to release these little things
called low rider plants and they were cute little things and they didn't have
a photo period like the big guys did and they were tiny you could grow them in
little six inch pots whoa so that was sort of exciting but the but the cannabis
that they produce was low in THC and very the plants were small cute novelty
you know a lot of fun to show people but not not something really that you would
grow to harvest fast forward to when Tom showed me these auto flowers about five
or six years ago they were decent sized tomato sized plants and they were
without question producing cannabis that was usable and I started to grow them and
fool around with them and lo and behold every time you you grew one it was a
better plant because the breeding on these things has has just multiplied
like crazy and because of interests in the in getting a plant that is available
for everybody there's been a tremendous amount of work put into producing seeds
that produce plants that meet all the requirements you would want to have for
growing this plant as a hobby plant home gardener not a cannabis producer but a
home gardener your aunt your uncle your mother you know your brother and sister
who don't like cannabis but love to grow tomatoes and cucumbers and zucchinis
boom these auto flowers now are at that point and so just because you know I've
got a lot of a lot of friends who I think would really love it I I sat down
and wrote a book and it's not the same kind of book as the teaming book is very
easy it's very light if you are a commercial grower this is not a book for
you this is a book for uncle Bob and aunt Sally at Christmas time so that
they can learn about cannabis and then learn about auto flowering cannabis and
the opportunities that it presents I can certainly imagine that this book is going
to be under a lot of Christmas trees this year and when you were talking about
you taught your your presentation a few years back at the Gardeners Association
you said that you know it wasn't immediately picked up and embraced by
the the writers and other media people are there and you said primarily you
thought because of the size of cannabis plants and of course it was it was the
plant itself was still very much in in legal prohibition transition at that time
but my question for you is very specifically because you know that your
your the your whole your book is all about normalizing cannabis gardening
right and and as somebody who's been writing a garden column for over 40
years and and you know you've won awards and you're very successful at that what
is it about gardening columnness which causes them to have to kind of err on
the conservative side you know I don't really I don't know the answer to it but
but I bet you do yeah I do it's fear and it's fear of your publisher which is you
know pretty easy to overcome you just go ask your publisher whether it's okay for
you to write about cannabis it's it's fear of of your readership turning their
back on you you know a lot of times that when I think about my my core
readership I think you know it's and I'm I really shouldn't be saying this but
I'm gonna say you know me I think you know the little old lady in tennis
sneakers and and is she somebody who wants wants me to be writing about
cannabis or should I be writing about marigolds and you know how to harvest
your potatoes so so it's fear and of course and then of course there's that
there's that that possibility you know that that that you say something that
somehow gets you in trouble with the law you know either it's illegal in your
state or you you make a suggestion you know somehow it doesn't fit with a
regulation so so for example in Washington State it's against I think
it's still against the law you tell me to no maybe it's not there's no there's
no home grow here yeah no home go that's that that's what I was gonna say and in
New York State when they were trying to pass you know Governor Cuomo got
convinced by boy I'm gonna get you know slammed it on this one you know by mad
men to not let people grow their own plants you know so you know there's
there is this stigma about and I'm gonna say the word I hate it marijuana you
know when you hear the word marijuana you know you're talking to somebody that
has a stigma about cannabis because it's a disgusting word from my
perspective it's a you know it's like putting a statue up to Harry Anslinger
who used that word to turn the public against this drug and and this medicine
and this wonderful recreational thing so yeah there's a big stigma there so I
remember when I wrote my first column on cannabis I always used to tell people
when you read my columns if I'm writing about tomatoes you can apply that you
can apply that knowledge to cannabis but but all of a sudden it was fully
legalized in Alaska and it's been legal here since 1975 in the privacy of your
home but it became fully legalized medical and recreational and I wrote a
column and I asked my readers are you gonna be upset about this and boy oh boy
people were just thrilled they were just thrilled about it because you know I
think deep down in you can be you can be pro-trump anti-trump you can be pro you
know any one of the Democratic candidates whatever deep down in all of
us understand that the ability to be able to grow a plant is a basic human
right and they've taken it away from us in so many places and and we want it
back and we're getting it back and now we have to now we have to use it properly
and so anyway that's sort of a little bit of a soapbox stuff right so so let's
talk about the the little grandma in the tennis sneakers that you're referring to
so so so clearly those of us in the cannabis scene we love the idea of
promotion of cannabis because in most cases it's our favorite plant but then
but but but your audience that you're speaking to this time with your book
your your audience are people who primarily love gardening and the love
of cannabis may be new to them either because they're you they they're spending
a lot of money on topicals and they want to make their own or they've fallen in
love with tinctures or or hell maybe they've just decided that they in there
you know they've gotten over the taboo and they love puffing in their home
whatever the reason you're speaking to this new audience of cannabis enthusiasts
and I would think that what you're hearing from them about why they're
excited about the plant is often different about what you hear from
cannabis people about why they're excited about the plant and so I'm
curious what what kind of unique things are you hearing from gardeners about
your introduction of cannabis and auto flowers that is different than what you
were getting from growers stoners like me sure well first of all I've sort of
tested this over the whole you know I don't I don't go out and just write a
book willy-nilly I got to do a little bit of little bit of research you know
and then I make the rest of the stuff up but just kidding of course but you know
I so I talked to gardeners in the Anchorage area where I where I live and
about the fact that it was legal and now they could grow plants and and they were
all trying to grow regular regular plants what happens with gardeners is we
get bored you know it's you can grow a tomato year in and year out and get
great tomatoes it's boring it's too easy and so what we look for are new things
to grow let's start with new techniques every now and then come along but what
we really look for are new things to grow and you and I've talked about this
before I remember and maybe you're old enough to remember when the snap pea was
introduced to the American gardener oh my god people went nuts you know and and
snap peas are now duragory you grow snap peas in your garden they're easy to grow
but I blah blah they taste great you can use them stir-fry and yeah so so people
grow snap peas you know tomatoes people bored with tomatoes got into heirlooms
why do they get into heirlooms because it was different it was exciting it was
it was a way to introduce new plants to your to your palate and and and so all
of a sudden you get legalized cannabis and people who are really into gardening
who can get their hands on either a clone or a seed they grow a plant and
whether that whether they're successful in getting a harvest or not they are
excited about growing that cannabis plant all the way through to wherever
they get because for the true gardener it's not the harvest it's not the tomato
it's not the marigold flower you know that that that you that makes gardening
terrific it's the process you know it's it's it's watching the plant grow and
develop and and it's the beauty of understanding you know that there are
cells being added because you because there are microbes down in the soil that
are feet you know there's a beauty to it all that's that that transcends just
that one moment where you pick the tomato you know or you take the tomato
over to your neighbor and brag about it you know it's the process of growing
that makes gardening fun and and cannabis is a fun plant to grow it's it's
got a lot of distinct stages and when you when you then go to an auto flowering
plant the fun becomes compressed into the same length of time that it takes to
grow a tomato the plant itself is small you can grow it in a five gallon bucket
you watch it go literally from seed to harvest in seven to nine weeks it
flowers or it shows whether it's gonna be a male or a female oh now isn't that
incredible I never get a phone call and then all of a sudden you end up with a
plant that you can't take your eyes off of because it's growing new leaves every
day it's getting bigger literally every day I almost compare it to growing a
giant pumpkin they put on 40 pounds a night 40 pounds a night well when you
watch an auto flowering cannabis grow you go to bed you get up the next
morning and it's bigger noticeably so measurably so that's an exciting thing
to have happen and then you add on to that what you and I know that is that
that this isn't just one kind of auto flower cannabis plant there's cannabis
plants that definitely do all sorts of things like CBD production or THC
production you can get different colors you can expose them to cold cooler
temperatures they turn purple you know they're they can become a landscape
plant you can put them around your you know your yard your walkways you know on
your deck they're a terrific plant on top of being a cannabis plant so Wow it
made for a great subject book fantastic well how about this Jeff why don't we
address that that call coming in on your side and take a break right now we'll be
right back you're listening to shaping fire and my guest today is Lord of the
roots Jeff Loewenfels. Cultivators who grow in living soil are very particular
on what inputs they use in their soil they educate themselves and
painstakingly create compost and nutritive teas to create thriving soils
that will produce the very best expression of the cannabis plant. Many
living soil farmers now believe that over time seeds become acclimated to the
kind of substrate they are grown in for example a seed that was bred in
synthetic fertilizers may not immediately know what to do in a living
soil environment slowing their growth and decreasing yield. The regenerative
seed cooperative is a different kind of seed bank. The regenerative seed
cooperative only provide cannabis seeds that were bred in living soil and using
probiotic growing techniques that way when you germinate in soil the seeds
genetics will recognize the environment and immediately start interacting with
microbes and fungal networks. These seeds are described as biointelligent. The
number of cannabis breeders participating in the regenerative seed cooperative is
rapidly increasing. Already signed on are Bamboos, Stock and Bean, Pacific
Northwest Roots, LOS Gardens, Dragonfly Earth Medicine, Ital Foundation, Bob
Hemp Hills Cricket and Cicada, Dutch Blooms, Heart Rock Mountain Farms Pride
of Lion, Sebring Seeds, and Mount Baker Highway with more being added every
month. These seeds are regulars, auto flowers, and hemp varieties. A significant
amount of the profits go to cannabis seed preservation projects available to
everyone. Do you want to take every advantage that you can when growing in
beautiful healthy soil? Then consider buying your seeds from the regenerative
seed cooperative at regenerativeseeds.com. That's regenerativeseeds.com.

back you're listening to Shaping Fire I'm your host Shango Los and our guest
this week is gardening author Jeff Lowenfels. So during the first set we
talked a lot about your motivations for the book and who the book is for and
and actually some really pretty poetic stuff about the the enjoyment of
gardening that we all share. Sorry about that. No no that's good I think that's good and I
think that really speaks to the heart of your book right? This book really is for
people who are in love with plants generally and to kind of encourage
people who are in love with plants and gardening to come on over and and and
and start to share in the experience of the black sheep of the family in
cannabis. So so let's give people a little bit of background on where
autoflowers came from you know clearly you we started the episode talking about
the 1970s and lowrider but but I've heard you give your talk on autoflowers
and and and you talking about where they came from is kind of exotic. Sure yeah
so there was a scientist he was working in the Volga River area I guess that's
in the Urals and in Russia and and he he noticed these little little teeny
cannabis plants and and he looked at him and he studied them a little bit and
sure enough he identified them as a new kind of cannabis which he called
ruderalis and which which apparently means rubble because these things grew
in these little rubbly terrible soily areas and what he noticed about them and
and what really caught his attention was that unlike regular cannabis these
particular plants bloomed before the other ones did way before the other ones
did and and when he did his research he discovered that in fact they were not
influenced by a photo period in other words the the the triggering event for
flowering is increased darkness beyond 12 hours they bloom because of genetics
so it didn't matter what the daylight was or the darkness these things bloomed
and set a set period apparently they came from the they were escapees from
hemp plantations and you know they they escaped and because of evolution they
they you know they figured out that if they didn't seed right away they before
the frost they weren't going to make it and so so they they bred into themselves
this genetic disposition to flower as opposed to having the normal photo
period flowering so so that happened you know and again it was it was of interest
but really nobody could breed them to do anything that made any sense and and it
really wasn't until the 1970s when a bunch of stoner guys frankly you know
started fooling around with them 60s I guess obviously and and I think I think
when they came out in 1971 it was a little bit early they were just there
was just a novelty plant nobody ever thought they were gonna be any good now
again you know you know cannabis growers they like to breed things and so
so people continually bred them not only with each other with but with their
cousins the bigger sativas and indica's but also different root or Alice because
you can find root or Alice all around the world it turns out so the particular
root or Alice that is in theory the one used for the low rider is said to have
come from either Finland or Mexico which I found to be shocking because I
thought oh there must be in some they must be in a cold climate but no there
root or Alice in Mexico their root or Alice in Alaska their root or Alice all
over so you breed them with different different root or Alice you breed them
with different different bigger parents and you end up with different kinds of
auto flowering cannabis plants one of the things that you mentioned in your
your live presentation about autos is is how root or Alice are are the really
only cannabis variety that really thrives in really crappy low nutrient
environments and I find that really interesting because not only does it
show the the vigor to live that are in these genetics but you also then go and
caution people to not feed them like they would a regular cannabis plant we
break that out a bit for us sure they they do the the one hat one set of the
parents do grow in in very poor conditions they grow very quickly they've
they've adapted to be able to get what they need from a soil food web
perspective in other words they're actually eights produce the right stuff
to get the right bacteria and fungi and they quickly they quickly take up
nutrients and they and they are capable of keeping a very rapid pace of growth
by taking up their nutrients without any help whatsoever from anybody now you
know we tend to forget that this is a plant that we call weed and the reason
we call it weed is twofold one it grows anywhere in theory and two it grows
quickly like a weed well auto flowering cannabis is the weed of weeds it really
grows quickly and it can grow anywhere what I've discovered and I think other
growers as well is that if you feed these plants it messes them up at least
at least initially they they have everything they need in that seed if you
if you put them in decent soil living soil you're gonna get a great plant if
you feed that soil all manner of nutrients as people tend to do when
they're growing cannabis you you end up with a plant that's that's confused that
can't adjust properly and and they burn quickly they grow spindly and you
lose you lose the essence of that great root or Alice that makes this such an
easy plant to grow I think this is probably one of the reasons why so many
I guess growers who've been growing for a while have yet more reasons that they
personally don't like auto flowers because you know people work long and
hard to come up with their recipe for growing and autos don't really fit most
people's recipes they they really do enjoy benign neglect like in a perfect
environment you'd have a no-till pot that's already set up and you put your
seed in there and then you forget about it and then you come back when it's time
to harvest and that freaks people out yeah yeah it is pretty amazing and you
can see one of the reasons why it was developed I mean you know if you were if
you were a clandestine grower you know you could grow these things under your
under your stairs without ever having to go in and look at them you know you put
an automatic watering system in you leave you leave the lights on for 24
hours holy crow you know you don't have to do anything to them you don't even
have to give them darkness the well that that makes that makes for pretty exciting
you know times you see whoo so so yeah so these plants really are so easy to
grow that it does frustrate the professional grower a little bit you
know they turn their nose up at them that you know by the same token a lot of
professional growers use their current system to grow these things and they
don't do well and then they badmouth the order flower plant which I have to have
to tell listeners are now becoming a normally used plant in many commercial
grows both hemp I should say all hemp CBD and THC in Oregon the main breeder
of these seeds only sells now to commercial growers and you know the
reason is is because they come out so uniform right good seeds are right
because that that is one of the challenges with auto flower seeds at
this point is you get a lot of different phenos in one pack generally
but the people at the top of the auto flower game you know this is not true
for all seeds the top the top seeds will all be exactly the same in uniform but I
would say that that is a very small fraction at the very top when most
everybody I mean this summer we popped a lot of auto flower seeds on Vashon and
we would get you know three footers and five footers out of the same pack right
yeah and I think I think part of that has to do with the fact that they are so
easy to grow and so what you've got are a lot of people who are who are buying
seeds and then and then further selling them on so you got middlemen selling
seeds you know and and they don't know what they are and really you know they
haven't tested them etc etc now you and I both know that that there are companies
that have perfected their seed breeding programs and you can find most of these
companies I don't think we want to give too many names but you can find these
companies by going on to the internet auto flowering network comm or is it
auto flowering auto flower net comm has a whole bunch of discussion threads about
seed companies and which ones are good and which ones aren't and the companies
themselves are represented there and so that is the one area I think needs to
improve sort of chicken and egg I wrote a book about about a plant that you might
have difficulty getting seeds you know at your local seed store yeah that's
for sure and for the record it's auto flower net oh good yeah totally it's
funny for being so simple it's really easy to throw extra words in there right
I've had that challenge myself but it is a terrific site and if anybody has even
the inkling of interest in these plants this is the place to go after you buy
the book because you will get all of the bud porn that you're accustomed to all
of the ranting and ravings of technique and flushing not flushing that you're
used to you know it's just but it's on auto flowers and I gotta say that you
know auto flower net was formed because the auto flower folks got harassed and
laughed out of so many of the grower forums that they just went and did their
own and you can still feel that because the community is very kind and I
actually find that all across the whole auto flower scene the people who are
growing them the people who are breeding the seeds you know that the green rush
really hasn't come to auto flowers yet and so people are very modest and kind
and you know there's jerks in every scene right but but overall I really
enjoy being a part of the auto flower scene because it it's not as cutthroat
as some of the other parts of the canvas industry let me put it in the vernacular
of the book it's because people who grow auto flowers are gardeners and gardeners
share they share information we'll talk about it later on they share food you
know that gardeners share it's when you get into the commercial world and you
you know that you're and you want to get competitive that you stop sharing and
you stop being a gardener and you start becoming a farmer which will you know
well maybe don't share quite as much as gardeners do but I think that's a
hallmark of gardening and and I'm hopeful that gardeners who are capable
of growing these plants and have seeds will share them and etc etc because
it's it's that's what gardeners do and this is a perfect plant. Right on. So let's talk a
little bit about the growing of the plant and some of the uniquenesses that
come with growing a plant that grows so fast so right so I dropped in briefly
that that you know the plant loves to be germinated in its soil because it's got
such a short life it doesn't like to be transplanted very much because the
momentary stress actually takes a significant part of its of its lifetime
but I also said that it likes to be put into a pot that's already been grown in
and has not been not fresh soil so what we think of as no-till and and what I'd
like you to talk about is you know not a lot of people use no-till techniques yet
people are still of the mind that you have to use fresh potting soil with with
every new grow but at the same time the the mycorrhizal fungi that you need to
form to move nutrients around the pot barely have time to form in an entire
lifetime of an auto flower plant and so how do these plants I mean we you know
we've both seen the flowers the flowers can be as as large as your forearm
they're huge colons. Oh yeah. They're not they're not lacking in size. How how is
this plant doing so much in soil that for most people is what we would
consider new soil? Yeah well first of all let's talk about this the concept of
throwing your soil away every time you grow a plant and then and then starting
over again you know that's that's old-school as far as I'm concerned for a
couple of reasons not the least of which it's not regenerative it's not
sustainable and you know we we're losing soil like no one's business in this
world and and we got to be we got it we got to keep it and we got to maintain it
so but so so what happens when you grow a plant is you know the root system
develops it drips out all these exudates it attracts the kinds of mycorrhizals
you're not my great well it attracts both mycorrhizal fungi but it also
attracts you know the bacteria and the other kinds of fungi that it needs in
order to be able to feed itself doesn't matter what kind of plant it is that's
just the way plants work that's teaming with microbes and and so this particular
plant when you plant it does just like every other plant does all of these
things when you plant it in brand new soil it it it has to create its own
growth channels it has to really scream loudly to these to these microbes to get
in into the zone and you know it really has to do do some work to establish the
kind of environment that it needs in order to be able to feed itself when you
plant in a pot that's already had a cannabis plant growing in it the microbes
that support cannabis are already in that pot they're just dormant they're
there in the right numbers immediately you don't have to you know you don't
have to attract them you don't have to gather them together and this is all
shorthand for you know what happens is the right microbes have to take out the
bad microbes so that the right balance is there's all of this stuff has already
happened in your previous grow and as important the roots of the plant have an
opportunity to grow in the channels left by the old root channel system and
so it's easier for not only is it easier for them but there are decaying or
carbon-containing old roots in those channels that are helping to feed and
maintain those microbial populations that are supporting the plant so so for
that reason it makes sense to grow almost any kind of a plant in a pot
that's had a similar plant grown in it previously did you just ask where you go
on did you just say that there's karma left in the roots well there's karma and
carbon carbon okay carbon all right I like the idea of karma though but it is
karma I mean you know that's what that's what that's what makes the plants grow
it's that carbon you know carbon is karma you don't have carbon you don't
have karma you don't have life so anyway so as you take then you take a plant
that has genetically developed to grow quickly Wow you know well if you give
that plant what it needs from the get-go it gets going so we plant these things
we you can start them at using you know the paper towel trick etc etc and I and
I do I do most of mine that way for one simple reason because I then I dust both
the seed and that brand new root which which appears incidentally usually
within about 24 hours as opposed to a little bit longer or almost twice as
long with with regular cannabis plants I then sprinkle rhizophagus intera
CDs which is the mycorrhizal fungi that feeds cannabis plants I and so I know
I'm getting the exposure on the roots right away and then I plant that in the
soil in the pot that I'm gonna grow the plant in for its entire life these
plants cannot be root bound a root bound plant while it while they're going to
their initial to their to their size a root bound plants we you know has a lot
of problems getting what it needs and you don't want these plants to be root
bound because they're growing so quickly you want them to be able to get whatever
they need right away and and so you put them in a five or seven gallon pot three
gallon minimum and and that's it that's the pot you want to use and you don't
have to transplant them every time you transplant a plant you are destroying
the root hairs that are that take a while for the plant to come back you
stress a plant you can you can stress a plan out it can slow down for a week or
so anytime you transplant it so and when you transplant these and they lose a
week that you're because they grow so fast that's a significant part of their
life you know it's like being away while your kids are going through elementary
school and then all of a sudden you're back here what happened you know yeah
exactly right you've got to be there for these guys every single minute of the
day because they're growing so quickly Jeff oh sorry yeah so so so then the
other thing of course is to make sure that you've got the right soil we've
talked about the fact that you don't want to soil is rich in nutrients it's
great to have a soil that's been used once before at least but you got to have
a soil that drains well any plant needs that these are just like tomato plants
and so in fact hey guess what the same stuff that you can use for growing
tomatoes you can use for growing these plants it's got to have good drainage
it's got to have lots of organics we do not use chemicals on these plants
because we don't use chemicals on any plants chemicals are non-organic we
don't go non-organic we only use organics because it's good for the
environment and it's because we put this stuff into our systems so we want
to make sure that they're they're nice and organic if you have to feed the plant
you wait for the plant to tell you that it needs something and these plants well
if they need something because they're growing so quickly you'll see the sign
very quickly and if you get on it very quickly you you can you can give them
what they need now what would you feed them with you know you can get a a you
know a good balanced you know I don't know a two two two or something in that
area type type liquid fertilizer organic and and you can give that to the plant
and and you'll see a different right away compost tea works very very very
nicely I like a little bacterially dominated compost tea on these guys so
so you see some problems you can use that and you can you always water with
compost tea all that all the way along because you can't over water with
compost tea it doesn't overfeed a plant so there you go so when we've been
talking about these these fast growing plants I remember the first time I came
across auto flowers and and then you brought it home for me at Emerald Cup
when we talked about it last year when when we were talking about how they go
from germination to harvest in 90 days not 90 days of you know flower but the
entire life span and being finished and being not being light dependent which
means that if you live somewhere that's got inclement weather or or short
summers like the Pacific Northwest where I live or for goodness sakes Alaska up
where you live but but also you know the New England states and and far far south
of the equator we all don't necessarily have enough summer to grow regular
plants but then you get something like this and you take an auto flower and you
can germinate on say June 1 and it grows June July and August and you you
harvest on September 1st well before the rains like when I first realized that
literally blew my mind because this opens up so much for for patients and
for gardeners like you're talking about and and for anybody who does not want to
deal with mold and botrytis at the end of the year where I'm going with this
though is that I had that mindset at 90 days but then now there are these new
cultivars that are 60 days and now people are telling me that they've grown
these 30 days which I have yet to grow but a 30 day from germination to finish
flowers you know I'm like I can accept it's not gonna be huge plant but the
fact that it goes through its life span so quickly blows me away my question for
you is is how did we get to 90 60 and 30 day varietals when they're all crossed
with Rudy right well there are different kinds of root or Alice first of all and
so some some root or Alice take longer to bloom than others and and I was
stunned to start receiving in the mail different kinds of root or Alice's that
people have collected and and so that's the first reason the second reason is of
course you're breeding them with plants that also have some genetics and and
there's something in some of those plants you know that impacts the duration
of the of the the growth period so so it's sort of a double whammy I it's
something coming from the from the sativa Indica's and then it's the
difference in in the genetics of the root or Alice itself right on so let's
go ahead and take our second short break and we come back and do set three
we're gonna talk a little bit about succession planning for auto flowers
which which is an interesting idea with cannabis but also Jeff has agreed to
talk a little bit about his background which we haven't really heard a lot
about so that'll be cool so you are listening to shaping fire I'm your host
shango Lowe's and our guest this week is gardening author Jeff Lohenfels we'll be
right back living soil and regenerative cannabis agriculture are surging in
popularity and to implement these biological solutions real science
education is vital if you are interested in all things probiotic growing you will
probably want to attend this year's science of organic regenerative cannabis
cultivation conference for the third year in a row co-founders Joshua
Rutherford of Dutch blooms and Leighton Morrison of Kingdom aquaponics have
lined up an incredible array of educators with all new content for the
traveling event they're calling it version 2.0 going deeper down the rabbit
hole this year's teaching staff includes Elaine Ingham on soil biology
Chris Trump and Wendy Kornberg talking Korean natural farming Kevin Jodry on
cannabis genetics Kelly and Josh from dragonfly earth medicine Suzanne
Wainwright the bug lady Chip Osborne on soil chemistry and many other thought
leaders rotating in and out for different cities so consult the website
to know who specifically is coming for each location there will be a breeding
panel a Q&A panel with the entire teaching staff and on Saturday night
there will be a bubble hash discussion as well Joshua has built in significant
informal time for you with the teachers the teaching staff is just as excited to
work with you as you are about attending there is also no advertising during the
event the only vendor booths are for cannabis seed breeders your tuition is
what's paying the staff so they all be present and attentive to you not a
corporate sponsor even better the conference is not just for folks on the
west coast Humboldt California is hosting one event for sure but the show
is going on the road to Vancouver British Columbia Portland Maine and
Whitmore Lake Michigan get out your pen now because I'm about to give you the
website this is a fabulous opportunity for you to hear from an array of
nationally recognized top-shelf soil educators all in one place not only that
this isn't just beginner stuff like you get at most conventions this is an
intensive for people like us who totally nerd out on the rhizosphere and
growing and living soil and if you attended last year be assured that this
year is not simply a repeat of last year every speaker will present different
material than they did last year the website is regenerative organic cannabis
dot-com that's regenerative organic cannabis dot-com this year tickets will
be limited in number to preserve the intimate experience and will only be
sold in advance online there will be no ticket sales at the door so don't wait
and miss out on your chance to attend this important gathering of the
regenerative cannabis community cut through all the misinformation out there
and don't miss this opportunity to learn real soil science regenerative organic
cannabis dot-com cannabis is fun medicine and we love to celebrate it
cannabis connects people and creates opportunities for new friendships at the
Tok shop we create custom cannabis themed jewelry money clips rolling trays
and home furnishings that you love and they also make great gifts too I'm
Ashley Villafranca owner of the Tok shop I came to cannabis as a patient seeking
an alternative to the pharmaceuticals being pushed at me for chronic pain and
fibromyalgia I realized that not only was cannabis a huge help in controlling
my symptoms but I found cannabis to be wonderfully social too cannabis makes
friends so I took my love of jewelry design and blended it with my newfound
passion for cannabis and began hand crafting bracelets earrings and
friendship necklaces and then expanded to money clips rolling trays and other
home furnishings all made in sterling silver 14 karat gold and aluminum so
there's something for everyone's budget I consider it all to be new age cannabis
fashion and cannabis couture I invite you to stop by my website at the Tok shop
dot co at the Tok shop dot co you'll find a wide array of attractive and fun
cannabis items starting at only 10 bucks and if you're fancy there are very fine
luxury pieces as well and I'm always happy to do custom orders with your name
or a particular theme come check out my array of items hand stamped with
terpenes cannabinoids and other cannabis themes that's the Tok shop dot co thanks
welcome back you are listening to shaping fire I'm your host shango Lowe's
and our guest this week is gardening author Jeff Lohenfels so last set we
talked a little bit about how the plant thinks and how best to care for her and
how rare her nutrient intake is one of the things that we just hinted on before
the commercial was the the fact that she grows so quickly that you can actually
do multiple rounds during the summer and and and certainly you can do cannabis
plants end to end or autoflower plants end to end where you you start something
in May and then you finish it in July and then go ahead and replant right in
the pot but because succession planning is so rare in cannabis for photo
photosensitive plants Jeff I don't think that a lot of people who grow cannabis
only and not vegetables understand the idea of succession succession planning
that we get from other quick to bolt crops like lettuces and stuff right so
would you go ahead and an explosion succession planning and how it can apply
to autoflowers that you so that you've got a rolling harvest throughout the
year well there's there's a couple of ways to apply it outdoors if you're a
regular gardener you you know that you just don't plant a you know a crop of
lettuce or radish these quick growing things you plant several of them and
there's two ways to do it one is you wait until your first crop is finished
you plant a second crop or you wait a couple of weeks after you put the first
crop in and then you plant the second crop so that you have what's known as a
continuous harvest at the end of the season and and that's how lots of people
grow lettuce so that they they have lettuce every every night instead of
just having it all you know all at once with autoflowers you can do the same
thing you can you can either plant the plant wait for it to harvest and then
plant a new plant in the same pot or you can get another pot after two or three
weeks and start a new plants so that you have a rolling a rolling harvest kind of
a nice way to go because it's a sometimes it's sort of a pain to clean
these plants and you know prepare them for drying it's nice to maybe maybe
extend the process and if you're an indoor commercial grower you can use
these plants in a similar kind of sort of quasi succession way if you're
growing in your veg stage you can put these plants in between your your bigger
the bigger cousins that have a photo period and similarly once they're in
flower you can do this you know the bigger cousins are and you go to the
flower stage you can do the same thing you can either start new ones or you can
finish off your autos but normally what happens is your autos flower and and our
harvested at the same time you then flip the switch and get into the
flowering stage on the big guy so you go from vegetative and it's it's just sort
of neat that you can add on to your existing harvest either by repeating the
same plant or by using these plants to supplement what you're growing elsewhere
we all have the experience of coming up to harvest and then suddenly having a
whole bunch of plants to dry and trim at the same time and for folks who are not
professionals you know normally we are hanging the plants in our living room or
are in our basement or the you know garage or whatever and we only have a
limited amount of space there I mean heck some people are drying in their
closets and that's one thing that's really great for the home grower the
patient grower the gardener that if you want to start seeds this week and next
week and the following week depending on you know your room maybe you want to
make it every three weeks this idea that you could be harvesting in you know
the beginning of the July and then the end of July and then the middle of
September and then it really allows you to be more productive with less space
and also if you live in a state that only allows four or six plants and you
were gonna bother to stay within the law it's like okay fine you know I'm gonna
grow my six plants but I'm gonna do I'm gonna do six four times this summer
instead of six that's gonna last all summer and that's all I get and sure
granted and generally the the plants are still smaller than full-size plants but
when you add all the grams and the convenience together at the end of the
summer for most people it's gonna make a lot more sense to do this kind of
succession planning oh yeah and you get to grow different kinds of plants so I
you know I don't know about you but after after a while of you know using
the same cannabis week in and week out like we used to do it during Prohibition
when you you know didn't have a source of different kinds you know it's not the
same it's not the same high it doesn't have the same effect but being able to
have variety oh yeah that's the way that you know varieties of spice of life and
so so so the autoflowers it's just like tomatoes I keep saying this is the next
tomato plant you can grow so many different kinds you can grow constantly
always have a harvest and and so far we really really been talking about growing
them outside but they grow indoors in the wintertime and everybody needs to
have a set of lights in the wintertime anyhow for their other plants you know
your house plants need need light if you're a gardener you need a set of
lights I always try to tell people in America because I write nationally you
need a set of lights in the winter we all need lights in the winter but plants
need lights in the winter well if you've got lights to grow your other house
plants you can be growing auto flower cannabis plants as well and now that
there's enough really good you know full spectrum growing lights out there it's
gonna you know the same location that can use these plants most like up here
us up in the north right it also helps with our seasonal effectiveness disorder
from lack of Sun for in two ways the product itself yeah absolutely and again
as I say and it's fun it's there's so much fun to grow I mean yeah you know a
plant that you've never seen before unfurling before your eyes is a thing of
beauty it's a you know it's a you know it's a mind blower and these plants are
mind-blowing and one of the things that I liked about it is actually one of the
things that some people complain about it's like okay yeah sometimes the seeds
are you know they may be there they're stable as far as like Herming but
they're not all the same right you're gonna get a lot of different phenos in
the same pack more often than not and and they express some traits that are
from the root or Alice often though though you know these generalizations
are certainly not applicable to the entire you know family of cultivars
right but but after you know growing them this was my second summer growing
them I really and you know as somebody who loves cannabis loves the plant is
interested in cannabis botany it was interesting to see all these different
terpene profiles and and how the plant presents itself over the last two years
I actually had a grower here on the island who is a cannabis patient and she
just does a few plants on her deck every year and you know she she grew a set of
auto flowers in the spring and then she had her full terms and when she harvested
or she was going to harvest her auto flowers she sent me a picture she's like
is this is this smokeable is this right and and you know it was a particularly
unusual looking cannabis plant it was it was clearly a happy plant with lots
of trichomes and it smelled great but for those of us who grow regular plants
it would the plant kind of looked like it was all foxtailed and so for for for
those of us who have been growing a while be like there that is a that's a
mutant that's a weird thing but actually the plant smelled great and was awesome
smoke and it was just expressing some of these oddities that come from the
rooty side and so you know was it necessarily something that you're gonna
want to put in the centerfold of high times well maybe maybe not it probably
would have gotten some really difficult feedback from people but as somebody who
loves to watch nature express itself it sure as hell is interesting yeah you
know if we've become so accustomed to bud port yeah which is which is sort of
meaningless when you think about it I mean I'd so much rather I love it I mean
but I'd much rather see a chart that tells me what the terpene you know
profile is but and the flavonoid profile because that tells me what the
beauty of the plant is it's it's not how the plant actually really looks so but
yes you're right you get some very strange looking things sometimes and and
you wonder where did that come from and then you you know you got it that's part
of the wonder of these things this is a plant growing before our eyes evolving
before our eyes you this is something you would have the capability of being
able to breed yourself you know it's just this is why I think it's America's
next tomato plant it's just something that's fun to be with and work with and
grow so and and your friend your friend you know my I would have said to your
friend don't forget you can grow these in the winter to indoors yeah I that
would get totally so so Jeff before we wrap up you know when you and I did the
the the 10 video shaping fire sessions which since this is gonna come out on
October 22nd all 10 episodes are now out and so so you and I got together and we
recorded these and we we had some time in between videos and and you were
willing to share some of your background with me because most of us in cannabis
know about you as the the Lord of the roots the writer of the you know teaming
with microbes teaming with fungi and teaming with nutrient series that is is
you know essential reading and cannabis which I didn't understand until later is
also essential reading and gardening but you know for those of us in cannabis it
was it's a holy trilogy but then you and I got to start talking and and I've done
enough introductions for you before that that when I get to the part where I where
I say that you are you know a recovering attorney everybody kind of chuckles and
we move on but it wasn't until we talked that I realized what a serious
big player power attorney you were and at the same time you were remaining
interesting in gardening so just because I've never heard this covered anywhere
else will you tell us a little bit about your your life as an attorney that was
running parallel to your interest in gardening yeah well I went I went to law
school in Boston and while I was there I was on a date with a lovely young lady
who happened to be a nurse and and we were held up I was shot she saved my
life I woke up the next morning she was there with my glasses and my law school
textbooks and I you know I got shot in the neck I stumbled out let's get
married to save my life and she said no you owe me but yeah okay and then I said
but we're gonna go to Anchorage Alaska and so we ended up in Anchorage Alaska
and I had a law degree and I always had a hobby gardening but when I got to
Anchorage Alaska and was was practicing law I discovered that the local
newspapers were both published by different publishers and one of them was
a but they were both printed by one publisher and distributed by one
publisher we handled all the advertising long story short we had a good paper and
we had a really bad paper and in a place like Alaska where we were getting all of
our news two or three days late because we were so far away and they had to fly
the videos up etc etc no satellites back then you know it was important to keep
the newspaper alive and we did and I helped quite a bit and the publisher
asked me what else I could do and I said I can write a garden column and so I
started to write a garden column as a way to help this newspaper but also as a
way to fulfill my family obligation to write a letter a week to my parents back
in New York and my father's a big gardener and so I would always write
about gardening and so the column sort of became a letter home to my father and
then it became a unbelievable legal tool I was an assistant attorney general I
was going in and out of court on temporary restraining orders all the
time I was doing really high-power oil and gas stuff involving Exxon and BP and
so high oh and you know all these big oil companies that deal up in Alaska I
was representing the state and I was I had the ability to be able to go in and
you know I needed to get a judge again on this calendar or her calendar you
know and the secretary would always say oh before what am I to do about my
African violent over here you know so it became a really great legal tool and
and I remember my first case in the Supreme Court of the state of Alaska
against these oil companies sent their lawyers up from all over the you know
really high-power attorneys my first time in the Supreme Court and the first
question mr. Lohenfels my wife wants to know what does she do about it and you
could see the ex-secretary of army who was representing Exxon understand
exactly what had just happened to him anyway so I practiced law and I was I
was a lawyer I was an assistant attorney general first for five and a half for
six years back in the day when Alaska didn't really have any attorney generals
and so I represented all sorts of terrific agencies ended up doing a
tremendous amount of private practice mining law oil and gas law environmental
law and I had a client who was the governor of the state of Alaska named
Wally Hickel who had a dream to build a gas pipeline that ran right along the
oil pipeline that took the gas that was being produced with that oil but was
being pumped back into the ground bring it down to Valdez convert it to
liquefied natural gas and ship it to Japan Korea and Taiwan and solve our
balance of payments with all of those companies the countries as well as
stimulate the economy all around the country so so I worked on that project
for years and years and years it was purchased by a fortune 500 company I
became the president of the company we permitted this unbelievable project even
in the face of the Exxon Valdez oil spill we had an environmental impact
statement that basically came out you know two months later in the same area
we got all of the permits for a project that you've never heard of that was the
world's largest construction project that ended up for political reasons and
I contend some nefarious ones at that getting killed by the governor of the
state of Alaska and and so at that point in time I decided you know this legal
stuff is is fun but it's it's time to do something else so I went especially
when you're doing the kind of law that you could turn the keys on your car and
your car could explode yeah I was you know I worried about the oil companies
blowing up my car there was no question I would I've been told that I was
extremely hated and feared you know by BP and some of these other oil companies
and well they should hate me and fear me because they they didn't treat Alaska
well and they certainly didn't treat this project well but but in any case
not to be too bitter about it all I during the tenure at the end of this
project now you have to understand that any big project that involves natural
resources in Alaska is a transportation play it all comes down to
transportation we are so far away from everything we are closer to Tokyo than
we are to Washington DC that everything involves transportation and and the last
couple of months of my career with this project a guy a truck driver walked into
my office and he said to me I've got this special soil that we got up here
all over the place and and I want to get it down to the lower 48 states and it's
a transportation play and you sure know an awful lot about it can you help me
well lo and behold it turned out this soil was very special soil it had the
highest microbiology that anybody had ever seen in soil and it was all over
the state of Alaska and particularly all over the Anchorage area and it turns out
to be the soil that grew the big cabbages that everybody knows about so I got
involved with it and and through becoming involved with this guy this
truck driver I I met dr. Elaine Ingham I was introduced to the soil food web
and when I went out from from the project and went into a practice
representing Alaskan inventors I started to write teaming with microbes for
regular gardeners because I felt that I had been so betrayed by the gardening
industry telling me I needed chemicals and I needed miracle grow and I needed
you know we'd be gone and all these terrible things when in fact it was the
soil food web that ran the system that that there was that truck driver and
then through Tom Alexander a mutual friend of ours mine who I want you to
meet and who I dedicated this DIY auto flowering cannabis book to Wow I just I
just got so turned down by the soil food web that I wrote these soil food
web books and and I wouldn't have done it had I not been a lawyer and ran into
this this fellow fascinating absolutely great great way to pull it all together
so before I let you go I do want to hit on one more growing related question and
you know anybody who has emailed with you sees in your signature on all your
email it says plant a row for the hungry and I know you're very passionate about
this program so why don't you tell us a little bit to maybe inspire us and get
some some more people to participate yes well this is it makes me cry you know
but anyway so while I was working on this gigantic project I used to go to
Asia once a month and Washington DC once a month and I was in Washington DC and
of course you would go to Washington DC on a fortune 500 expense account you go
first class so I flew first class I stayed at the first-class hotel the
Willard Hotel and I ate first-class to the expense account restaurants and I
was there one week it was the coldest week they had ever experienced in
Washington DC the gas was being shut off they closed the airport they shut down
Washington DC except for tourists who are stuck there and it was crazy
unbelievably cold and I remember going to my home out of my hotel to a
restaurant which was really glad to see me because there wasn't anybody else
around that was a very expensive restaurant having a very expensive meal
and leaving with my hands in my pockets because it was so cold with money
wrapped around you know in my hands and a guy came up to me and said I need some
food can you give me some money well in Washington DC there are signs
everywhere they say do not give money to panhandlers we have our own system blah
blah blah and so I refused to give the guy money I and he followed me and he
said come with me watch me eat and I still thinking of those signs did not
help him I ended up at the Willard Hotel the doorman you know saw me coming with
this guy following me he saw the doorman he ran away I went to bed that night in
my hotel room which had not just a little little you know chocolate on the
it had a fruit basket a bottle of wine I had the worst night's sleep of my life
it was Scrooge I saw my parents you know what did you do to that got you stiffed
a guy who needed your help that's not the Lone Fells way and oh my god I woke
up the next morning it was still freezing I looked for the guy all over
the place I I had to take my plane home they finally opened the airport I got on
the flight I'm flying first class I'm flying over over your area of Ashen
Island you know having a great flight drink I have a steak and zucchini and
I'm looking down at it and I can't get this guy out of my mind and I think
about the zucchini and the joke that if you live in Wisconsin and and you you
park your car at night you always make sure you lock it because if you don't
when you get into car the next morning it's full of someone's zucchini you know
it's so hard to give away and I said she's I you know that's what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna get everybody in Anchorage to help us why my bad conscience for
stiffing this guy I can still see his face today for stiffing this guy I'm
gonna get everybody to donate one row of their garden through my garden column to
what's known as beans cafe our soup kitchen up here and it was a very
successful program and it helped me feel a little bit better I only had the
nightmare once a month you know I only heard my father's you know you know once
a month and and and then one day the Garden Writers of America came came to
Alaska for a convention they heard about the program they visited beans cafe and
we adopted it as a national program and it exists still today we supply tons
hundreds of tons of food a year to supply the soup kitchens the synagogues
churches you know food banks any place that will take food the gardener grows
it the gardener harvest it the gardener takes it in nothing slips between the
lip and cup in terms of money no administrative costs no you know you
don't have to support anybody the it's plant a row for the hungry and I
encourage everybody to plant one row in their garden to feed the hungry and if
you're going only cannabis then some of your cannabis ought to go to a vet or
somebody that needs medical cannabis because gardeners share and that's the
best way we can possibly do it we have 30 some odd million people going to bed
every night hungry in the United States of America unconscionable just just
incredible and then you know you go out of your garden in Bashin Island and
you'll look at somebody who's left broccoli there or left lettuce because
they're sick of sick of it after the you know no you take it to somebody that
needs it this is has to be the basis of how we live so there I am you can hardly
shut me up about it that's beautiful Jeff thank you very much for sharing
that very personal story yeah so with that it is time for us to wrap up thank
you so much for sharing so much of your time not only here to talk with us here
today but to put your passion into writing the book that comes out today
and links will be provided for that everywhere the podcast is but just thank
you for sharing your good cheer and your joy and your experience and being well
willing to put it all on the line with us well you know I always appreciate your
show and you know that now I I've got this book published it's time to get to
work on the next one do you are you ready to share with us a topic yet well
I will share with you the topic but I but I will tell you my criteria and this
one will be part of the teaming series I hope that the publisher takes it but my
criteria is it has to be something that's usable by the gardener you know
and I don't mean just scientific information that's interesting I mean
something that they can actually employ in growing plants that'll make them a
better gardener that they're not aware of and they're not using today I think
I've got something right on well we will certainly be excited to check that out
when it comes out and I know everybody's gonna be excited to have another teaming
with book and I'll have to like retrain myself to no longer call it a trilogy
what are they gonna call me you know Bach fourth I don't know what hey I
don't know sorry about that folks call me anything you want but late for dinner
