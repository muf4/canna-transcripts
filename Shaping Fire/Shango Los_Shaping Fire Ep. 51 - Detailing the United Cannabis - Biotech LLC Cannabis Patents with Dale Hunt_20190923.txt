We are experiencing a clash of civilizations right now in cannabis.
Generally speaking, the heritage of cannabis is sharing. We've always shared
cannabis flowers and seeds and insight on how to grow. At the center of cannabis
culture is the whole idea of puff puff pass and not to Bogart the joint. While
certainly there were some folks who may not have wanted you to circulate their
special cut of some strain or another, the vast majority of time cannabis folks
shared whatever they had because we were all sharing in the oppression of the
government through prohibition. Now though, the emerging licensed cannabis
market is based on ownership, extravagant packaging, and intellectual property. This
is a very significant change. And I won't say that the schism is within the
cannabis community. I will say that it's within the cannabis industry because
again, generally, those who are seeing the green rush as a quick way to grab it all
are often outsiders coming in or longtime insiders working with newly
accessible outside capital investment. And we all know how corrupting sudden
access to piles of cash can be. One of the ways that companies are trying to
take advantage of the young infrastructure of the cannabis industry
is by filing exceptionally broad patents and daring for anyone to try to take
them on. Because few people have the depth of pockets to take them on.
Certainly I'm making some pretty big generalizations here, but if you're
watching the cannabis scene evolve, you know that on the whole I am right.
Certainly I know some newcomers to cannabis who have their heart in the
right place. And it's also certainly true that some of the heritage folks were not
all that kind. Intellectual property is legal though, and you either are or are
not filing for an overbroad patent. You do not accidentally lawyer up and file a
patent that pretty much says you invented an entire product category. It
is not like accidentally bogarting the joint while talking too much before
passing it. If you want to learn about cannabis health, business, and technique

Dale has extensive experience with patent protection with a technical
emphasis in life sciences like cellular biology, genetics, genomics, immunology,
microbiology, molecular biology, pharmaceuticals, protein engineering, stem
cells, transgenics, agriculture, plant genetics, plant patents, and plant variety
protection amongst a bunch of whole other bunch of other areas. Dale also has
experience with patent portfolio management and strategy advice,
international intellectual property matters, intellectual property due
diligence, and licensing. He pretty much does it all. Having started as a botanist
and plant geneticist, Dale continued his study of plant biology at the cellular
and molecular level, completing a PhD at UC San Diego. Dale then went on to UC
Berkeley for law school. Dale has spoken at Emerald Cup as a panel expert on
cannabis patents and Dale is also a pretty great all-around guy. His law firm
is called Plant and Planet if that tells you anything. Today we're gonna talk in
detail about two of the most hotly discussed cannabis patents that
presently exist and what breeders and cannabis lovers everywhere can do to
help support open access to cannabis genetics. Welcome to the show Dale. Thank
you I'm glad to be here. So let's jump right into it and and even though we've
done quite a few shows about cannabis patenting at this point I think it's
really important to bring people up to the now in the difference between plant
patents versus use patents because a lot of people who are new to this topic
of cannabis patents they kind of just picture them all in one big bucket but
since we're gonna be talking about both plant and use patents today I think it's
good to get us right on the same page of what the differences are between those
so so would you start there please? Yes I'd be happy to. So I think the easiest
way to think about how to distinguish these things is to think about the fact
that a plant selection, a plant variety, a cultivar can be seen as a unique thing
a unique result of creative effort by a plant breeder or it can be seen as an
invention that has lots of different applications and really they're both
true but the reason I set it up that way is that a plant patent is meant to cover
the plant as a unique thing and it protects against copying it and so the
best analogy that exists in intellectual property is to say that a plant patent
is a lot like a copyright on a plant variety it only protects against direct
copying it doesn't protect against similarity it doesn't protect against
independent derivation of something even with the same parents it only protects
clonal copying of that exact genotype as well as its harvested material. In
contrast a utility patent is it can cover the same the same underlying plant
variety but it treats it like an invention that you can use in a lot of
different ways and that you can potentially claim in a lot of different
ways. So what I mean by that is with a utility patent one of your claims and I
should just stop and explain a patent claim is like a fence around your
invention it's it's the definition of the boundaries between what you invented
and what still is out there outside the scope of your coverage and so when
you're doing a utility patent you can claim you can claim your invention any
way you want as long as you can demonstrate to the patent examiner that
it is new and it's not obvious and that it has utility and that it's not outside
of what's called patentable subject matter. So if I treat my plant variety as
an invention one of the claims I could write would be the cannabis plant or
plant yeah okay a cannabis plant
typified by I'm not finding the best words for right now but a cannabis plant
typified by the seeds that are on deposit under accession XYZ or cannabis
plants related to the seeds that are on deposit and if you do it this way you do
need to make a seed deposit but then that so that could be claim one is
defining the plant based upon the deposit the next claim could be
something like progeny of the plants of claim one another claim could be an
extract made from the plants of claim one or claim two so an extract made from
that variety or from its progeny you could have a claim to a method of
breeding cannabis comprising having the clay at the plant of claim one as one of
the parents now what this does is it makes it so that you can protect that
variety a lot more broadly than just straight-up clonal copying you can
protect you can well you can maintain exclusivity as to the right to breed
with that plant if you care to if that's how you want to claim it you can have
control over the extracts who can make extracts and and so on and again it's
you think about each of these claims as a fence around the property of your
invention and so there's nothing inherently right or wrong about either
one of these approaches plant patents are a little less expensive and faster
to grant utility patents do take a longer process to persuade the examiner
that each one of these claims is actually worthy of patent protection but
in both cases they're really going to be focused upon the variety that the
breeder developed and so in both cases it's my opinion it's well within the
right of the breeder to protect that kind of invention or that kind of
development right on um I actually never really thought about the idea of
of a breeder having a choice whether which one they wanted to pursue I didn't
realize that there was so much overlap I thought it was either clearly going to
be a plant a patent or it was clearly going to be a use patent but really
there's a lot of overlap and and and how you'd file contains a lot of strategy
about what you expect your challenges to look like that's very true and I actually
wrote a blog about this topic because it came up so much and I wanted to
people to be able to understand kind of the analytical pathway you go down to
decide what kind of IP protection you need for your for your plant variety the
blog is titled something like let's talk about reproduction and how you will get
paid and I have all my blogs on plant law.com but the point of that blog and
the point of the analysis is that if you are going to protect your plants if
you're gonna sell clones let's say you want to be able to control who is who's
allowed to make clones and if that's how you're gonna make your money you need a
plant patent and you also need more than that because you still need you need to
control you know you need to be careful about who makes the clones and who sells
them because it's so easy to go out and copy a plant and make more clones that
the patent will give you the right to stop from someone for making those clones
if you're willing to litigate against them and if you even find out about them
but it's always best if you're selling clones to only work with someone that
you really trust to make the clones and to restrict what's done with the clones
afterwards so for example maybe you've got a variety that has just that just is
a great flower quality and you want that to be as accessible to people as
possible you want it to be in a lot of dispensaries and so you want there to be
a lot of harvested material that's available for for commercial access but
you don't really want somebody to just grab a little bit of your propagating
material and start to compete with you that's the whole reason you got a patent
in the first place and so if you're selling clones only so that other people
can propagate and and sell harvested material that's great but you should
restrict even then you should restrict what they can do with those clones and
that that gets into some other complicated areas that are probably
beyond what we should go into today but I'm happy to explain those in more
detail with if anyone's interested so okay that's one thing if you're selling
clones you've got to go with a plant patent because that well that's one
thing you can do and it's a simpler option but if you're selling seeds it's
really important to understand that a plant patent won't even protect that
because the plant patent only protects direct clonal progeny it does not
protect seed progeny so you're really your only choice if you're selling seeds
is a utility patent if it's a high THC variety or if it's industrial hemp seeds
that's also something that you can protect through the USDA plant variety
Protection Act that's called a plant variety protection certificate and I'm
just gonna stop here to explain that the rest of the world is different sometimes
I get I was actually challenged by someone who said you're giving bad
advice you should tell everybody to seek you pov type protection well you pov is
an acronym for it's a for a French the French title of this convention but it's
basically the English version is the International Convention on Protection
of Plant Varieties and it establishes plant breeders rights that you can apply
for in any member of this convention and those plant breeders rights are very
they cover both seeds and clones but they have some exemptions that make them
a little bit problematic anyone can breed with something that is covered by
Utah you pop certificate as there's this express breeders exemption so that if
you obtain you you pop rights but someone has access has legitimate access
to your plants you can't stop them from using that plant to breed other plants
now some people may say that's great that's a great result that's great
public policy it enhances the diversity of what people have access to for
breeding but anyway so the rest of the bottom line here is the rest of the
world is different in the way it protects plant varieties the u.s. is
unique in having really three different approaches the USDA PVP approach which
is like you pov and the rest of the world the USPTO plant patent which is
like a copyright and the USPTO utility patent which treats like any other
invention right on well thank you for that explanation I can I can already
hear the breeders strategizing in their head on the other side of the signal and
for folks who are listening because you yourself are a breeder and you actually
have to think through this strategy for yourself stick around for the second set
of the show where we're gonna be talking with Dale in detail about about
what actions that you can take to actually protect yourself but right now
during the first set I want to I want to shift with you Dale because now that we
generally have an idea what that the the area that we're talking about I would
like you to give us some good detail on the two probably most talked about
patents that that cannabis folks especially to heritage growers are
calling overbroad and and certainly Pete these names have been coming up a ton
since the Phyllis debacle but you know people have been discussing the biotech
LLC patent for a few years now I give credit to Amanda Chicago Lewis when she
wrote that story in Rolling Stone that kind of made it apparent to everybody
what was going on and kind of brought it up to the public consciousness but
people talk about that and you know how people talk on the internet my god all
these people who have either wrong information or they're or an incomplete
set of information but everybody's got an opinion right and so I figure as both
a plant scientist and a patent attorney you are going to be able to offer us you
know some rare insight into this so let's the first of the two I want to
talk about is the biotech LLC patent so if you would like take us from square
one explain what the the patent is kind of the two sides of the debate and and
share your thoughts if you would sure yeah well this patent is it's definitely
a utility patent and it's it's there's actually a family of patents that have
similar strategies to cover related subject matter so I'll just talk about
the the one that gets talked about the most which is let's see I'll get you the
number of the patent it's where'd it go it's patent number nine three seven zero
one six four and anyone who wants to follow along at home can actually Google
that and they'll probably be able to get a copy of the patent right in front of
them so it's nine three seven oh one six four and actually there are a few of
them that are like this but this is a good one to talk about so you know how I
talked about the fact that when you have a utility patent you can claim it any
way you can claim your invention any way you want as long as you can persuade the
examiner that the that what you've claimed is new and not obvious and
adequately described and falls within allowable subject matter and I should
explain what that means the allowable subject matter thing is it comes from
section 101 of the patent statute and it just says that well the court
interpretation of section 101 is that there are certain things that are just
not patentable including laws of nature and products of nature and so we can get
into more detail about that when we talk about the the next patent but in
this case this the kinds of claims in this patent are not not restricted by
section 101 and so the patent examiner would look at the claim and ask is this
new is this obvious and has it been adequately described and the patent
examiner clearly was reached the an answer to a yes answer to all three of
those questions I'd like to walk through the claim and then we can talk
about whether that yes answer was was appropriate that sounds great okay so
claim one which is typical and it's the only claim we'll spend any time on
because this has a lot of claims and it would get tedious but it it claims a
pan of a cannabis plant or an asexual clone of a plant or a plant part or a
tissue or a cell that produces a female inflorescence so basically it's a female
cannabis plant and it has at least 3% THC and at least 3% CBD and a terpene
profile that is not mercine dominant and a terpene oil content greater than 1%
now there's some other other language in the claim that just talks about what the
other terpenes are that's pretty standard list of terpenes as far as I've
been told and then it also talks about how those terpenes are measured it's
measured by gas chromatography and then the last phrase is we're in a
representative sample of seed producing said plants has been deposited under and
then there's a list of accession numbers so they made several seed deposits as
representative samples what's important about this claim is that this is what I
would call and what other people have called it a chemotype claim it's not
it's not limited to any of those particular samples that's why they
deposited multiple samples and said it's just representative so this this claim
would cover by most people's interpretation and I've got to stop and
just say I'm not for I'm not providing any legal advice to anyone this is this
is my educational analysis kind of of the way patent law works as applied to
an exemplary claim if anyone needs legal advice on this I get a I dig a lot lot
deeper and provide legal advice in a way that is much much more detailed so no
one should rely on this as any kind of legal advice this is educational only
all right so what I've been told by lots of people is that this chemotype is
one that has been around for a long time that people can point to examples of
other cannabis plants that pre-existed the filing date and let's go back and
look at that filing date so we can be clear about this the filing date of this
patent is July let's see sorry it's well the yeah the filing date is July
17th 2015 and the earliest date that it claims back to which matters the the
patent eligibility analysis is always a function of different dates and then was
there anything before those dates that was out there in the public domain and
was known so the earliest date that this is entitled to under any theory is
going to be March 15th 2013 so back to the kind of the public discussion of
this there are people lots of people who say that this particular chemotype
pre-existed 2013 they can point to other strains or cultivars of cannabis that
are at least 3% THC at least 3% CBD and and are not mercine dominant and that
have greater than 1% terpene oil now I want to emphasize that I haven't I
haven't independently analyzed any cultivars and I haven't fact-checked
anyone's assertions about this so from here on out this is a discussion of the
way the patent law would work if those assertions were true and this does
expose one of the fundamental problems with with cannabis patents any kind of
cannabis patents with any kind of breadth and that is that when the
examiner is looking at this claim and trying to decide if it's new or
non-obvious they don't just put their finger in the wind and and wonder they
have a particular procedure that they go through and they do this for biotech
patents medical patents airplane engines electronic devices anything at all that
you're claiming to have invented what they do is they look at the claim and
then they do a search involving keywords and categories to try to find the
closest thing they can find to this claim and they look in in other
industries they will have you know at least tens of thousands or hundreds of
thousands of moderately relevant academic papers to look at in in the
overall database of what's already known what's in the public knowledge so they'll
they'll do a search if it's a biotech case they might they might really have
access to well they would easily have access to over a hundred thousand
different academic papers and probably a lot more than that as well as they they
would also search all of the prior patent literature and they look for
whatever is closest to that claim and then they use that as a basis for
rejection of the claim and it's almost always a case that a claim will be
rejected the first time around because it's almost it's kind of the examiner's
job to explain why that or well to say that the claim isn't allowable for these
reasons and then put it on the applicant to explain why those reasons are
incorrect now the reason I'm going in all this detail is that suppose now
you're an examiner handling the first ever chemotype patent application for
for cannabis you go through your normal procedure you look in all the academic
literature but how much academic literature is there on this topic
there's a little but not very much not remotely not not even orders of
magnitude within the same amount of literature that is typically available
for a patent search then you look at all the prior patent literature and somewhat
surprisingly to some people the USPTO has been handling and granting cannabis
related patents all the way back to the 40s but this was the first time anyone
had tried to claim a chemotype so the examiner can't just say this seems like
it's too broad the examiner has to have a basis for rejecting the claim the
examiner looks in the so-called prior art that's the whole public database of
prior literature academic literature or patents and can't really find anything
or maybe find something that's kind of close but not not all the way close or
maybe find something that looks like it but whatever the the problem in utility
patents with cannabis is that there is just a complete disconnect between a lot
of prior commercial activity we know that people have been enjoying chemovirus
and chemotypes for a long time right but no one was documenting it people were
going out of their way not to document it and so the the robust literature that
usually corresponds to a robust commercial environment doesn't exist for
cannabis now the result of that is that the examiner looking at this didn't have
access to all of the commercial activity at a record of all the commercial
activity that happened before legalization and so in a way you think
if the examiner's tools for giving a rejection are prior publications the
examiners just don't have the tools to adequately examine some especially broad
patent applications relating to cannabis so Dale before you before you go further
let me give voice to what a lot of people are probably thinking which is
like what the F like what you just described is is a mess because there are
two things that we know true number one there were clearly chemovirus that had
more than 3% THC and 3% CBD in the market and while myrcene dominant sure
that limits because myrcene is clearly the most popular terpene dominant
chemovar out there there are absolutely plenty of chemovars that are not
myrcene dominant so if those are your two most limiting factors and really
you only need above 3% on THC and CBD and above 3% and excuse me and not
myrcene dominant I can hear people out there feeling like me like we know those
exist of course those existed you know however the second part is is where is
the evidence because we've had to be in the underground for all this time or we
didn't have analytic labs or or people have these plants and they have not
filed them to to get a time stamp on them it's it's astonishing right I mean
you I like how you are approaching it neutral and sans emotion to give us the
data point but I can since I'm not the attorney I can say what the hell right
because right we know damn well that these plants existed period and and and
I now understand more when I when I talk to other experts what they often will
say is ah the you know the USPTO didn't want to put in the work for the research
so they granted the patent and they figured that we'll all kick it around in
court for a few decades and it'll get sorted out but they didn't want to be in
the middle of it now what you're saying though kind of lets them off the hook to
me a little bit until I hear what you say because I'm like oh if this stuff
has to exist in a in a searchable form in the patent library or in a searchable
form on Google well hell I might have a hard time finding that myself and so now
I'm like alright so so before you continue on what's your thoughts on the
I don't know let's say the attitude of the Patent and Trade Office did they did
they not do their job or did they do their job but because we are uniquely
talking about a plant that has been prohibited it's not their fault there's
nothing and this is gonna have to play out in court because the prior law
doesn't exist I will start by saying I'm no apologist for the Patent Office I
I've worked with the Patent Office for 23 years and there are good examiners and
bad examiners at the Patent Office just like there are in any organization but
if the examiners ever try to take a shortcut or do the safe thing it is to
just refuse to allow a claim I've I've in addition to my my practice in
cannabis I've worked a lot in biotech and and cancer and other things like
that and I've certainly done battle with examiners for years trying to get some
some claims to cancer treatment allowed they were broad claims but the examiner
couldn't find anything that was right on point but was still very very hesitant
to allow the claims because he didn't want to get second-guessed in the Patent
Office and he certainly didn't want to have his his patent associated with some
ugly litigation over its validity or associated with you know become kind of
almost a household topic a dinner table topic about how the examiner didn't do
his job and so my my answer to people who say that the Patent Office just just
punted on this is that notwithstanding my frustrations with many patent
examiners they are much more likely to just say no than to say yes but they
have to have some remote basis for saying no and it has to be defensible
and if they just don't have any literature they can cite they can't just
have a feeling and they can't there's a limit to how much independent
investigation they can do one thing they can do and that I want to encourage the
Patent Office to do more is to actually put the applicants on the spot with what
are called requests for information and sometimes when a patent examiner
believes that there must be something out there that they haven't been able to
find but that must still be out there they can they can ask they can issue a
request for information so for example I was handling a plant patent on a mango
in Australia and the examiner couldn't find any evidence that the plant itself
had been commercially available but he did find something in in a fruit
catalog that listed this that the fruit itself is having been commercially
available and he said I'm putting it on you to tell me on the record whether
those trees were ever sold to anyone were the trees ever publicly available
that's what you're trying to patent and I see evidence this evidence gives me
enough to ask you to put it to say on the record what was actually going on
that how did this fruit get into commercial availability and so we had to
investigate that and we were able to supply enough information to make it
clear that that while the fruit had been available the plants hadn't been and
and that mattered I won't go into all the details of that but it is up to the
examiner if there's any shred of indication that something may have gone
on that that they just didn't don't have access to in their database they can
force the applicant to to state on the record what they know or to characterize
the historical situation and I think what happened in this case is there's so
little about prior existence this is so little published or accessible
information about prior existence of this chemotype especially and we should
emphasize this is especially when the examiner was looking at this there's
been a lot of information published since then about people reacting to this
patent but when the examiner had this in front of him or her they didn't even
have enough to issue a request for information so in the future I'm hoping
that patent examiners looking at these kinds of things well what I'd really
like to see is have people be less inclined to do what are people are
calling the equivalent of a land grab or a gold rush on broad patent claims that
have people seek claims that are more narrowly directed to what they actually
bred and created but I would also like the examiners to feel more equipped to
issue these requests for information and say all right I can't find anything in
the prior art but I know that there was a whole closet industry or an
underground industry here and so I want you to show to tell me how you
characterize prior unpublished commercial activity in this space and
that doesn't make the applicant that doesn't give the applicant a duty to do
an independent investigation but it does put them in a position where they
have to say on the record what they know about that. Why don't you think the
patent office asked that? I think they just didn't know enough about the
industry. You know the patent examiners probably are not the same ones that
that were really familiar with a great variety of chemotypes from their own
personal use of their own personal experience in the industry and so I
don't think it it stood out that that was something that was even likely to
exist in this patent examiners experience. Now this is a
few years ago and there's been as we all know there's been a hell of a lot of
talk about it since then and people do have the same reaction that you had
which is of course this isn't new maybe it's never been published but of course
it's not new and that's what I've heard a lot of people say but I think the
patent examiner just didn't didn't have that same kind of instant reaction and
didn't have a real basis for issuing requests for information plus I will say
requests for information are pretty rare they usually come when you find
when you find a document that points you in a direction it just doesn't get you
all the way there to a valid rejection and so then the examiner says I'm going
to rely on this for rejection unless you can convince me that I shouldn't so I
could go into a lot more detail about this but but basically I to answer your
original question I don't think this was a case of the patent office taking
the easy way out I think it was them working with the tools they had and
recognizing that there was a limit to what they could do and not having any
kind of genuine legal basis for rejecting this they went ahead and
allowed it but the other part of what you said really is true it this is going
to play itself out in the public discourse like this and if they ever
choose to enforce this patent against an alleged infringer then I think there
will probably be all kinds of people in the industry that will come forward and
say okay well here's here's a cultivar that we can show existed prior to 2013
that has this this chemical profile again I'm not saying I haven't done my
own investigation but you know I've heard your reaction lots of times and so
if that's factually accurate probably multiple people will come forward and
defend whoever gets sued for patent infringement and say here's our evidence
that this claim doesn't meet the novelty requirement and therefore is not valid
you know that's really interesting that what what they've got essentially is an
overbroad patent that exists unless they were to try to defend it at which case
everything would be put into question again and and I don't know it's odd the
idea that there's an unenforceable patent it's like their best strategy
maybe just to not try to but then what value does it have it's a very
interesting legal position it's certainly gotten them a lot of press I
wouldn't say it's all good press obviously but I actually haven't heard
any of it be good I haven't either but there there are some other nuances that
to patent strategy that they did employ that you know we've we've been talking
about it's a very broadest claim and it sounds like that broadest claim is quite
vulnerable to an attack for lack of novelty they have a series of narrower
claims and maybe there's some narrower claim that actually would define the
invention specifically enough that it would be new and would hold up in court
and then the question is would there be anybody out there who's infringing that
particular claim because it would be narrower and a lot harder to infringe
and that's just you know that's a matter for a matter to be sorted out it when
there are specific facts on the table one other thing I'll say though is that
this is this kind of risk of your own patents validity when you sue someone
for patent infringement is that's that's standard in patent litigation I've
worked with lots of clients where before they decided whether to assert their
patent they did kind of a double check to see what are the what are the greatest
the most viable challenges to validity that someone could pose for our patent
do we really believe our patent is valid because if we don't we don't want to
spend millions of dollars litigating it and we don't want to come out of that
process with an invalidated patent and so in in the real world in kind of more
mature established industries people recognize that getting an overbroad
patent is mostly a waste of money because you can't enforce it or at least
you're really risking losing it when you enforce it sometimes though people will
pursue broad patents in the hopes that they can become part of a licensing
scheme that they can make it more attractive to take a somewhat troublesome
but not prohibitively expensive license just as insurance against ever having to
defend yourself from from a patent infringement suit so you know that
there are a lot of things that someone can do with a patent besides winning a
case in court and I am NOT privy to what the strategy was behind this but I will
say that I've heard your reaction a lot of times as to the novelty now I did
because I got so many questions about chemotype patents generally and about
people you know coming up with something that's really new and then wanting to
claim more than just their own genetic developments that I did write a blog
about that too so if you go to plant law comm I have a lot of detail about what
it would take to actually get a valid chemotype patent and why it's probably a
bad idea to even try right on so so so before we go to our first commercial
deal I know that I I changed your path and took you down this rabbit hole so
you know obviously we're not going to cover all the all the vagarities of the
biotech LLC patent today but is there anything that is in your notes where
you're like I need to get this in before we go to commercial and come back and
talk about United Cannabis no I think that pretty much covers it it's I'll
just kind of sum it up to say that it's it's a matter of I think everyone who
dislikes this patent should almost do their civic duty to identify whatever
evidence they're personally aware of that would that would that would fall
within the scope of these claims because if this ever if this ever does get
enforced and if it is as invalid as people say it is then there will be
someone who needs help and so if people in the community are outraged by this
patent the call to action would be document what you know that was prior to
2013 and be ready to step up and help your neighbor I think that's that's a
good call to action I think that's great deal it's not only is it crowdsourcing
from within our community but it's also citizen science kind of stuff and and
we're big supporters of both so so if any of you have got evidence of these
chemo bars that existed prior to the 2013 save that evidence before it is
lost to time so with that we're gonna take our first short break and be right
back you're listening to shaping fire and my guest today is plant scientist
and patent attorney Dale Hunt growing cannabis in greenhouses is taking over
the cannabis industry an efficient and effective blend of sunshine grown
terpene profiles and the controlled environment of indoor greenhouses can be
the best of both worlds for many greenhouse operators though building
their greenhouse before gaining insight into how cannabis greenhouses differ
from ornamental crops can be the start of a world of hurt Eric Branstad and his
team at greenhouse advisory group have the experience and technical know-how to
help you avoid these pitfalls Eric Branstad has been helping cannabis
growers find locations design build and equip their greenhouses for over a
decade first starting in Northern California but expanding over the last
five years to helping clients throughout the world he has an impeccable reputation
for both depth of knowledge and kindness and communication you can hear Eric
explain some of the challenges facing cannabis greenhouses and how to overcome
them in episode number 41 of the shaping fire podcast no matter where I go in the
country good people with smart backgrounds still are making the mistake
of building without knowing cannabis and it causes them to burn through capital
and time fast everyone has their own failure point for some it is improper
ventilation planning for others it is surface temperatures of the building or
the plants leaves or both some folks that build their greenhouse from scratch
make really basic errors like placement of the greenhouse on the property or not
understanding the natural environment where the greenhouse sits some have even
built a decent greenhouse but are inefficient in their deployment of light
deprivation techniques and never really hit their target yields it's great when
you learn from your mistakes but it's even better when you learn from the
mistakes of others when you bring on greenhouse advisory group you will learn
from the mistakes of their many clients and you'll take advantage of the best
practices developed by Eric Branstad over his years of working with clients
just like you from location development to choosing a builder and tricking out
your new greenhouse or retrofitting or rescuing your failing greenhouse Eric
will help you through it visit greenhouse advisory group dot com to
learn more and connect with Eric and his team that's greenhouse advisory group as
a listener of shaping fire you already understand the importance of living soil
when growing cannabis when you have active micro communities in your
substrate you go way beyond simply fertilizing with nitrogen phosphorus and
potassium having active microorganisms in your substrate supports vigorous
plant growth throughout the plants root zone making for higher yields and
thriving flowers mammoth pea is the first organically derived microbial
inoculant that focuses on your plants nutrient cycling processes to release
soil phosphorus and other micronutrients from their bound forms making them more
available to the plant increased levels of phosphorus will also keep internode
shorter and focus your plants energy on bud production not only that but the
microbes act as a defense shield for the plants rhizosphere by out competing
potentially harmful pathogenic microbes pretty cool right mammoth pea not only
unlocks the nutrients in your soil but it also helps protect your plant from
disease mammoth peas beneficial bacteria act like micro bioreactors
continually producing enzymes that release nutrients mammoth pea was
developed at a US University has been extensively tested by Colorado growers
and independent laboratories mammoth pea is proven to increase growth and
enhance blooming one of the great things about supplementing with microorganisms
is that they won't compete with whatever fertilizer program you're already
running simply dose on top of your fertilizer schedule for increased
benefits to learn more and to find out where you can buy mammoth pea near you

back you are listening to shaping fire I'm your host shango loess and our guest
this week is plant scientist and patent attorney Dale Hunt so I thought we were
gonna get through both of the the the troublesome patents in the first set but
there's a lot more to the biotech to talk about than I thought and so let's
go ahead and we'll start wading into the United cannabis patent just like we did
the biotech LLC so Dale if you would take us through a general explanation so
people understand the context of what we're talking about and then dive into
the two sides of the debate so people can really grok what's going on that
would be really appreciated you bet so this time we're talking about
US patent number 9730911 so if anyone wants to google that and pull it up
again it's 9730911 and this is a patent that was granted to United
cannabis claim one is really short and really easy to understand so I'll read
it verbatim a liquid cannabinoid formulation we're in at least 95% of the
total cannabinoids is tetrahydrocannabinolic acid or THCA that's it
so they're claiming to have invented and I don't actually have the priority date
here I could I could get that before during the next commercial break but
they're claiming to have invented I think it was before about 2015 to be the
first people to have ever had a liquid cannabinoid formulation that is at least
95% THCA and you know in the last one we only looked at claim one but here
it's important to emphasize that they also have independent claims five if
you're following along at home look at claim five claim ten claim sixteen claim
twenty and claim twenty five and here's why they all have the same phrasing a
liquid cannabinoid formulation where it we're in at least 95% of the total
cannabinoid is and then claim one is THCA claim five is THC claim ten is CBD
claim sixteen is a combination of THCA and CBD a claim 20 is THC and CBD
together and claim 20 is CBD CBN and THC so what that means is these this
patent applicant went to the patent office claiming to have been the first
to ever have in their possession to have to have made a liquid cannabinoid
formulation that was 95% of one thing as compared to all the other cannabinoids
in the mix now what's important to understand is the way you interpret this
claim it doesn't mean that it's 95% pure it could be it's any liquid it's any
liquid that has cannabinoids in it where 95% of the cannabinoids in it are one
thing the thing that's claimed and the other 5% or less is some other
cannabinoid let's poke at that for a second yeah so so so that the two things
that stand out for me are number one would this include a solution that was
95% THC isolate and then 5% vehicle solution yes because that would make it
a hundred percent THC and the claim is at least 95% I see so it's it's it's not
95% of the total solution right that's exactly that's exactly it that that
whatever else is in the solution that's what makes this claim really
breathtakingly broad yeah is that it doesn't matter what else is in the
solution it doesn't matter how clean the solution has at least by a conventional
interpretation of the claim the plain language of this claim it is just that
of the total cannabinoids at least 95% is whatever they call that's that
clarification is huge right it's not right because like at first when you
were reading it I'm like okay well you know my specialty is not extraction
right but and and when I'm you know seeing tests for analytics for dab oils
and RSOs and things like that you know they'll float between 55 and 85 pretty
easily well again 95% for an extracted oil is pretty high in in any situation
but the fact that that that what it describes is oh not the oil how it comes
out of the plant but any fluid that 95% of the cannabinoids are one of our
target cannabinoids that suddenly makes it from huh curious to holy crap
laughable yeah and and that's it's it's so strange credulity that I do urge
people to Google it and read the claim for yourself and I'll read it one more
time in the context of what you just said it's a liquid cannabinoid
formulation so it's just a formulation in a liquid state that has some
cannabinoids in it a liquid cannabinoid formulation we're in at least 95% of the
total cannabinoids is whatever they call out is THC THC a CBD they have a series
of claims that claim each one of these as a separate invention that of the of
the total cannabinoids is a major phrase right there it sure is it sure is so
obviously again I will point out that I haven't done any chemical analysis on
this I haven't even done any any literature research all I have all I'm
doing is processing the reactions of people who have firsthand experience in
the industry and their reaction is so far I not exaggerating to say it's
uniformly what the hell or something like that it's it's uniform in credulity
that that this claim is would be a post 2015 invention and didn't exist before
that so do I know I know that you roll with these like serious patent people
and plant science people because I know you're talking with them like on stage
and before you go on stage and and do you know what their position is on this
how you know what their fallback is how would they respond to this do you know
that well what I hear I mean for some reason maybe just because it came first
or maybe because it's it's actually into chemotypes and people care about their
their chemotype their their their chemotype profiles I still pick up a lot
more upset and outrage and stress and frustration about the biotech LLC patent
family but but when people do talk about this one and focus on this one it's just
kind of a it's an almost mutely astonished reaction that this just can't
be again I'm passing along their their reaction to it and I think maybe it's
it's that mutely astonished either because it creates a sense of complete
defeat or it creates a sense of okay well this there's just no way this can
stand in any in any just situation and what's interesting about this is this
patent has been asserted this is in active litigation in Colorado right now
do tell okay so you can sued a group called the pure hemp collective and sued
them on the basis of some CBD formulations that they were selling and
this case I believe it was initiated last July give or take and so you know
then there was a little bit of an outcry about all right what's gonna happen here
is the court even going to hear this because one of the questions before this
case happened was will a court even will a federal court even permit patent
litigation to proceed if the subject matter of the patent claims overlaps
with something that's federally illegal some people thought it would just get
thrown out now there there are at least two reasons well there's one really good
counterpoint I've heard which is all right maybe some of these claims cover
THC just like well like claim one and claim five and claim ten and so on not
claim ten claim sixteen but the the product that was being sold commercially
was not fairly legal it was a CBD product and so you know the people who
want to maintain hope that a federal court would never entertain patent
enforcement litigation over something that was all about THC they can still
hold that hope out because in this case a THC product is not the accused product
it's a CBD product and that might make a difference the other part of it though
is just that I would think you know the argument I would make in favor of a
court hearing a case like this is look this is a federal agency that granted
this right it's a federal right and you're a federal court so do your job
right and in this case if if we're to believe everyone that says that these
claims just aren't new the job of the court would be to hear all the evidence
and eventually to find that there's enough evidence of prior commercial
activity involving or basically prior public availability of liquid cannabinoid
formulations that fall within the scope of these claims to invalidate the claims
that were asserted and that's that's another bit of esoterica that is worth
discussing when you sue someone for patent infringement you typically say
that they're infringing claims X Y & Z you call out the specific claims that
they're that you're accusing them of infringing and then they have a right to
petition for declaratory judgment by the court that those claims are invalid but
they they can only invalidate the claims that are inserted asserted against them
the other claims aren't aren't in play so the outcome of this litigation I
believe that it was just claims yeah I think it was claims 10 and 16 and 20
that were asserted because those are the claims that recite some amount of CBD in
the formulation and so those are the claims that would be at risk and it
could be invalidated in this litigation but that wouldn't touch the other claims
that were not asserted all right so taking this back away from the just the
generalized incredulity of whatever at this point of the show the lips aren't
working as well so so we're all astonished that it was granted but
beyond that you know if we go back to the beginning and talk about the biotech
LLC issues part of it is where is this stuff in the historical record right
because everybody was underground in the medical days things were not archived as
as often and without evidence the patent and trade office doesn't have
anything to turn down a patent on I'm thinking that we're gonna run into that
that we're in the middle of that same situation now and and the folks who have
are you know are having to defend themselves against these patent claims
they're probably trying to find any kind of evidence that's out there showing
pre-existing art and that might be a really difficult thing that's it is very
difficult and I think I kind of talked about this topic a lot at different
meetings and one of the things I say is that I believe that that the patent
system the utility patent system is going to have a problem with the with
the so-called presumption of validity of an issued patent when it comes to to
cannabis utility patents they're gonna have that problem for a generation
because it's going to take it a full generation to have an academic literature
and a patent literature that is comparable even even comparable to the
kind of academic literature and patent literature that examiners usually search
when they're looking for looking to analyze the the novelty and non
obviousness of a claim and so see when a patent issues the courts treat it with
the so-called presumption of validity which just means that they presume that
the patent that the patent examination process was done correctly and that that
the patent was issued properly and what that presumption means is that the
defendant who's trying to invalidate the patent has a higher hurdle of evidence
to submit in order to actually get the patent and validate it it's not just
like a 50-50 okay you win this coin toss you have to have what is called clear
and convincing evidence of patent invalidity and but I do think that this
presumption of validity it well it's based on the idea that the patent
office did its job and had the right tools to do its job and I think that
when it comes to broad cannabis utility patents since there's essentially no
prior art or you know no no significant prior art it's it's maybe 1% or less of
the prior art in other industries the searchable usable prior art that is a
tool of an examiner's job that that because of that this presumption of
validity is just much much weaker it has to be weaker because we know that there
was in parallel with all this lack of published literature there was a very
robust commercial activity still happening it was just not documented
okay so a couple things so the first thing is is uh so outside of any
potential American companies that might have made these products and had
evidence of them being brought to market how about non-us companies say like GW
Pharma who I would suggest probably had such a had a thing that they had created
in the lab but had not brought to market how does that play out the fact that
they are a British company and not an American company and the fact that they
had not yet brought it to market you're asking in terms of what what their role
would be in terms of creating prior art yeah correct so so with with this with
this serum that was more than 95% THC and or CBD the fact that it just existed
in the world is prior art enough to unravel something this yes well not
quite because the prior art has to be has to be evidence of either prior
excuse me prior public public knowledge or prior public availability I see and
so it has to be either be a printed publication or on sale or somehow some
kind of commercial availability so if GW Pharma was publishing studies that
involved that kind of a solution in the research that would be that would count
as public knowledge right absolutely anything that's published is considered
public knowledge so Dale if if this is already being litigated right now in
Colorado and and these folks are trying to defend their product against the
patent claims of United Cannabis what is the where we at with it right now where
are we at with that litigation and are we starting to get a smell of how this
is gonna play out because this is a pretty big deal for the whole industry
yeah it really is interesting one of the things that happens when someone gets
sued for patent infringement is that they have a deadline to provide an
answer to the complaint and in the in the answer by Pure Hemp Collective they
listed all kinds of products that that were allegedly available here or there
commercially and that that already met the standard of being 95 plus percent
as part of whatever other things were present in the liquid you know so there
are things that were 99% CBD in a liquid formulation or something so they put all
that evidence into well they put they put assertions that such evidence
existed into their answer but for all that evidence to really be considered
the case would have to go all the way to trial there are some things that can
happen pre trial and one of those things was pretty interesting they sued for
what is called summary judgment they moved for summary judgment
partial summary judgment as to some of the claims on the basis that what was
really being claimed was a product of nature and therefore unpatentable
under section 101 if you remember from the previous segment and so there was
because that didn't require any particular amount of evidence it was
really more of a question of objective scientific fact and applying the law to
that fact the judge was able to handle that motion without seating a jury or
without going all the way into trial and because of some of the the evidentiary
standards and so on there are only certain things that you can even put into
a motion like that but what they so they did ask the judge to consider whether
this was an unpatentable product of nature and after both sides made their
arguments that the patent owner you can argued that the product of nature that
that comes straight out of the plant is not a liquid it's it's a soft solid and
you know people who've done res rosins and and other kinds of you know crude
extractions you know they can all have their own opinion about what it is that
comes out when you just what is really present in the tricolour is it a liquid
or is it a soft solid but the judge considered the two the two possibilities
if the judge had found it to be a liquid then it would be a product of nature
wouldn't even be patentable but the judge was persuaded by this by this
argument instead that rather than being an actual liquid according to the
dictionary definition of liquids it was more of a soft solid and therefore that
what is claimed is not a product of nature it has been altered by by human
interaction so that that was that hit the news wires as some kind of a defeat
for pure hemp and kind of a strengthening of you cans position but I
actually wrote a blog about that one as well and just said this is no big deal
finding refusing to find invalidity on this particular point is not a finding of
validity of the patent it's just a finding that that this particular theory
that could be advanced at this stage wasn't successful but what we're likely
to see is as they get further into the the process of producing evidence and so
on if the parties don't settle if it actually does go to trial then pure hemp
collective will put all this evidence in front of a jury or in front of the judge
I don't remember if they've demanded a jury trial or if this is something that
the judge will handle but either way the evidence will be considered and if if
what appears to be abundant evidence that there were plenty of liquid
formulations there only even has to be one but if there are if there is even
one liquid formulation that falls within the scope of these claims that predated
the patent then these claims will be ruled invalid all right so the idea that
if it if it goes to trial is really interesting because we have been seeing
all over the cannabis industry these big well-funded in capitalized behemoths in
the industry coming in and pushing on trademarks and and on product pack
product patents with these smaller players who just simply don't have the
kind of deep pockets that it takes to defend themselves with somebody with
highly paid lawyers that can go a long time so what are we seeing in the moment
as far as as the hemp folks being able to even garner the resources to present
a defense well that is a good question and I can tell you I've looked at the
court papers I did that in in preparation for another talk I was
giving and I looked in quite a bit of detail and they they do seem to have
good representation that is doing a thorough job of the defense I don't know
how they're funded I hope that there are people that are coming to their defense
if they need it they may have had litigation insurance so I don't actually
know how they're affording the defense they have and I I think if they ever
seem to be running low and need some help there probably be people that would
volunteer to step up and help them because everyone benefits if if if it is
true that this patent is overbroad and invalid and again I'm trying to be more
objective about that and because I haven't looked at the evidence myself
but if it is true that there is that kind of evidence and that this patent is
invalid then having it invalidated really benefits everyone because then no
one will be will be getting a letter saying you need to take a license to our
patent or you need to stop selling your product that would be a public benefit
yeah it sounds like a good reason for a go fund me so so how long do we expect
this to play out is this something that's gonna be kicking around for a
decade or is this something that's you know gonna be pretty aggressive and
we'll be wrapping up here in the next you know year or two well I'm no
litigation expert usually what I do is is transactions relating to IP and
helping people get patents I've I've walked some clients through litigation
and so I know about how litigation works from that perspective but I my general
sense is that different judges set different pace different kinds of pace
for the cases they handle and that the pace of this case will be somewhat up to
the judge and then somewhat up to this the time required to gather the evidence
in discovery and then the parties if they're negotiating some kind of a
settlement they may request some kind of a continuance to to settle the case but
I would expect that this if it goes all the way to trial it could drag on for
another year or two I don't know that before authoritatively though yeah right
I just just something for us to go with right so that we all have a better
understanding so all right so before we go to our second commercial you said
something and I didn't want to interrupt your flow a while back but I
thought I think it's very important to note that the fact that there is not a
rich library of cannabis information make is showing proof of products that
have been in the market how long they were in the market what the packaging
looked like what their claims on the package was their analytics there's this
big void and you said something interesting you said you know this
creates a sense of you know a lack of knowingness that is probably going to go
forward a generation as the old evidence comes out of the shadows wherever it may
be and if there's not evidence in the past the new body of work that is
happening now with decreasing prohibition as it fills in the holes and
like a generation later we'll have this stuff you know decided better for worse
but you know yeah I spent most of my life as a business strategist and that
sends up huge red flags for me because so many of these businesses that are
you know getting high-level capital investment and are you know IPOing as
part of their value package they're claiming IP and this IP is not settled
and what this tells me is that I love hearing you're laughing what this tells
me is that these these value claims of these companies will be in question for
a while and wildly increasing the risk that these companies need to overcome I
think that's true although it's not I would say that it's it's more true in
some fields than others if you're claiming something that that has the
technology to have been around for a long time and just isn't documented
you've got to really be suspicious about whether that patent is valid so you know
something as technologically friendly as can you make a liquid formulation that's
not that's not very new so liquid formulations have clearly been around
for a long time and it makes you wonder have these particular liquid formulations
can are they how likely are they to be new in other situations so you know
there are really new fundamental technologies that are being applied to
cannabis and it's very unlikely that some new like let's I'm not advocating
genetic engineering but let's talk about there's there's something called CRISPR
which is a technology the less people edit genes in in living organisms and
change the genetic expression without actually putting in any foreign genes
and so if you have a technology that's as new as CRISPR and you have patent
claims that are directed to some new beneficial use of cannabis that involves
that then you could as you could safely assume that you wouldn't need a long old
old history of prior art going back a few decades to establish whether that
was patentable or not you'd have less of a likelihood that that existed in a in a
in a previous industry that was kept in the shadows so it is a function of what
kind of invention it is that would that would give you more or less confidence
about the the strength of someone's patents and there's just one other thing
I want to say about utility patents because these two patents are so far out
there and incite such an emotional reaction in a and a what-the-hell kind
of reaction from people it has it has kind of created a bad name for all
utility patents and if you if you have a cultivar of cannabis that you bred
yourself and that is special and it can do some great things and you know you
originated it and you're trying to get utility protection just so you can
protect the seeds because that's the only way to protect your seeds if it's a
high THC cannabis a plant patent isn't available plant variety protection
certificate isn't available so it's a utility patent or nothing hating on
people who get utility patents of any sort is I think that's a gross
over-interpretation of the problem I would liken these two patents to you
know 18 wheelers with 30-foot trailers rumbling down a school zone at 90 miles
an hour and if you don't like that that doesn't mean that you can't like someone
riding their bike through the school zone or driving a normal car at 25 miles
an hour in the school zone just because they're all motor vehicles doesn't mean
they're all doing the same thing doesn't mean they all pose the same threat and
sometimes a utility patent is the only tool available to someone who just wants
to protect what they actually created within a normal appropriate scope that
isn't overreaching and because these utility patents have so offended people
in the industry there is I think a real backlash against what I would call very
appropriate and necessary utility patents well yeah that's for sure I mean
I'm a big fan of open source nearly everything but it wasn't until I
interviewed Reggie Godino on an earlier episode that I realized that open source
is a good place to come from in the heart but we need these pat we need good
people to get patents and exert their patents just so that we can defend the
heart of cannabis so it isn't all owned by folks who don't want to use it in the
same way that that those of us who've been in the family for a long time want
it to be used I would agree with that yeah so alright so so let's go ahead and
take our second break and when we come back we're gonna talk about some real
brass tacks about how folks who are are breeding and developing plant lines can
play a little defense against these types of patents and and stick their you
know draw their line in their stands so you are listening to shaping fire I'm
your host shango Lowe's and our guest this week is plant scientist and patent
attorney Dale hunt this message is for folks who grow cannabis I'm talking to
home growers patients and commercial growers too I'm probably talking to you
when you plan out your next growing cycle be sure to check out Humboldt CSI
seeds at Humboldt CSI calm Caleb inspecta and his family have lived in
Humboldt County for over a hundred years for the last 40 years three generations
of his family have cultivated extraordinary sense of me a cannabis in
Humboldt Mendocino and Trinity counties because of his lineage and the hard

welcome back you are listening to shaping fire I'm your host shango Lowe's
and our guest this week is plant scientist and patent attorney Dale Hunt
so Dale now that we've scared the hell out of everybody during the first two
sets let's then bring this on home right because one of the things that I
appreciate about chatting with you is that you're constantly looking for
solutions for these challenges for breeders because you know the more I
read your blogs and talk to you about the kinds of things that interest you
you know I can't be the first person to recognize that you have you have made a
bit of a path from being a straight-up you know patent attorney to actually
being a bit of a cannabis activist it's pretty obvious what side of this that
you are on while you know remaining clear-headed and neutral but I enjoyed
talking to you the other day about you know what strategies are that you
recommend for people developing you know clone only chemovars and seed sets to
protect what they've got going on because you know clearly everybody cares
a lot more about this since the phyllis mess and people don't really have
solutions and you know from show to show and we talk about patents pretty
regularly on this show and and everybody kind of comes to the same
point of you know we don't know how this is gonna play out yet there are no clean
right answers because everything is in play but the you'll hold this unique
seat where you are a plant scientist and also patent attorney where you can kind
of see the state of play and say all right we don't know how this is gonna
play out but the best defenses that we can do today are ABC and that's what I
want to talk about because a lot of folks that are listening they're putting
their life's work you know out into the world and and they and they don't want
to get skunked they especially don't want to be skunked by people don't have
that don't have the same heart that they have so so talking specifically about
plant genetics and breeders wanting to protect their creations what are the
present best protections available for these folks well one of the protections
is actually free and I wrote a blog about it I look up on plant law calm and
look for the picture of grapes and I don't really remember the title of the
blog something about protection from for your IP that is free and never expires
and unfortunately it only helps with it only works with one business strategy
and that is let's suppose you have a cultivar that you've developed and you
love it and it's fantastic and but you either can't afford a patent or you just
don't want to go there if you're so if all you're selling is flour and you're
never going to sell a clone then you can sell you can then the challenge you have
is to just control whoever gets access to your propagating material you can
sell harvested material all day long it's dried it's cured and no one can
replicate your clone from the harvested material if you control all the cloning
and control where all those clones go and who grows them and you've got good
agreements to govern all of that then you might not need a patent the bad news
of that is that even getting those good agreements in place with people is going
to cost some money and then there's still some trust involved and some
challenges when you have to trust other people and that's why people even even
big companies that control well then when I talk about big companies I'm
talking about like my great clients and my my blueberry clients they don't let
any of their genetics out of their hands they're vertically integrated but
they still get patents because if it does slip out and they can't it's
impossible to have a big organization a big operation and still have perfect
security if anything does slip out they and it ends up in the market they need
to be able to have some recourse against whoever is using their genetics without
their authorization and if that's not someone you made it made a contract with
then you can't sue them for breach of contract and unless they're the ones
that stole it and you can prove they stole it you can't go after them for
theft but you can always go after them for patent infringement if they're
propagating your plants without your permission and you can prove the patent
infringement with a DNA test that gives me an opportunity to say one thing about
DNA a lot of people think you have to have a full DNA sequence or a DNA map or
something to apply for a plant patent it's not true I also wrote a blog about
that and I think it's titled something like none that's how much DNA you need
to how much DNA information you need to apply for a plant patent I've obtained
counting international ones I've obtained thousands of plant patents for
my clients and we've never submitted DNA now on the other hand the first time we
had to prove infringement in a really contested case and with these grapes
that I've worked with we got a DNA test right away for that because that was the
way to prove infringement and the point is that you can always go get the DNA
evidence it can be helpful to have it in advance because then you don't have to
show a chain of custody and everything you can say this is the same DNA tests
that we submitted in our patent application and our cue this accused
plant matches it completely and so it's clearly infringing but you don't have to
have that DNA evidence to to get the patent in the first place and then you
just you just basically do a comparison of your patented cultivar and the
accused cultivar and the DNA will make it open and shut so that's why even
though people can have a viable business just based on agreements and on high
security some people that have good agreements and also have high security
still choose to patent what they have because it gives them recourse a
different kind of legal recourse against people who end up coming in and using
their stuff without permission and they're just you know you don't have to
prove theft you don't have to prove a breach of contract you just can prove
that that they don't have a right to that they're using your plants and
without your permission.
Got it.
Oh so so got it so so if that is the if that is the business model that is most
easily protected it's also like one of the least common in in the scene right
now right folks who are growing their own cultivar and are the exclusive
people bringing out on the market certainly they exist but certainly
there's a hell of a lot more people who are bringing seeds to market and that's
probably gonna be the bulk of people's concerns so let's wade into that.
All right I'm glad you asked about that because that's when your choices are
really different if you are commercializing seeds or selling seeds or
or anything except except harvested except flower and you want any kind of
intellectual property protection you're you really do have to either go with a
utility patent to protect the seed to have claims that protect the seeds or if
it happens to be industrial hemp you can go through the USDA plant variety
protection system but in any of those cases you still have to have you either
have to exert perfect flawless control over your plants and what's done with
them or you have to have some kind of some kind of contracts or you have to
have some kind of intellectual property recourse and the problem is you can't
exercise that flawless control over your genetics if you're selling seeds that's
that's the whole point is you're putting them out there and so in this case if
you want to be selling seeds you're either going to have people growing
those seeds without permission or you're going to be able to get a patent on your
seeds and at least restrict you know they can buy your seeds they can grow
your seeds but they can't use them for to for their own breeding and that's a
hot button because a lot of people really believe in the importance of open
source cannabis breeding and I'm I'm someone that supports that not
withstanding the fact that I'm a patent attorney I recognize that the industry
itself in the community is very passionate about sharing genetic
resources it's been a kind of an ethic within the industry for a long time and
those people who want to do that it's not for everyone but people who want to
do that should be able to do it and I I caused a little bit of a stir by writing
a blog that says why open source cannabis doesn't work and how to fix it
and so I definitely have a legal analysis behind that.
So let's get very specific so let's say that I am a seed maker and I am
breeding unique cultivars or at least ones that I consider unique we'll have
to talk whether or not they're unique legally or not and I want to put my
seeds out and I I want to be the only person that can sell seeds that have
got my name on it and and no one else should be able to breed with my seed
stock unless I give them permission I'm guessing from the rest of the show today
that that's actually a pretty high high level of difficulty to secure that but
let's hear what you have to say.
Well it doesn't have to be difficult if you are if you're focused on if you're if you're
willing to pursue a utility patent that isn't one of these overbroad 18 wheelers
barreling down the school zone it's it's a it's a nice friendly Subaru or
something going 25 miles an hour it's an appropriate vehicle for protecting your
invention that you limit your claims to the specific cultivar that you placed on
deposit which would be a seed sample and you say I'm claiming seeds related
to these seeds seeds they're the same progeny of the same cultivar as the
seeds that are on deposit I'm not claiming anything else I'm not using
those just as an example of what else as an example of something typical of my
claim that is what I'm claiming so first of all that's a modest request it's a
modest scope of protection you're only protecting the thing that you invented
not other things people that not things that other people might someday invent
and if you do that through utility patent then you can you can get claims
to seeds that are progeny of the plant of the plant cultivar that's on deposit
you can claim a method of breeding cannabis involving crossing one of those
one of your cultivar with something else and so if you do want to be able to
maintain that kind of exclusivity and you don't want to be in more of an open
source model then then utility protection isn't actually it's not
inaccessible and it's not it's not an overreach it's that's the only available
way really to protect your seeds if they have over 0.3% THC well if they make
plants that do that so I understand how that works downstream from me if I was
the breeder but how does that work upstream so you know just about nothing
out there to breed with as a land race anymore right you know most breeders are
not going you know into these like original heritage countries and bringing
back seeds so let's say that let's say I'm a breeder and I'm going to cross you
know one seed that I bought from one breeder and another seed from another
breeder and I'm gonna cross those and I'm gonna make a whole bunch of seeds
and then let's say I do a sift of a hundred of them and I find my favorite
to like how far away from the original two seeds do I need to get before I can
patent it do I have to do I have to do something novel to them or can I just
take any two I mean can I just cross the Mac one to anything I'm like boom I want
to patent this well like it or not the standard for novelty when it comes to
patents and plant genetics is really low if it's if you're trying to patent a
cultivar you just have to show that it's new if you're if your patent claim is
limited to that cultivar it's it's impossible for one cultivar to be
obvious over another one it's legally not possible and so it's really all
about the novelty and if you think about the novelty really and this this sounds
crazy but it really is true every single seed ever formed in a cross is
new and different from every other seed genetically if you think about all of
the genes that get shuffled in a sexual cross that results in seeds there are no
two that end up being genetically identical yeah that's true I mean we've
got all these different phenos and and so so would it be based on the short
read of the genotype or of the of the genome instead of how it expresses
itself as a you know in any particular environment or see I'm just thinking out
loud so so what I'm what I'm hearing here is that I can take any two seeds
and if they are not already patented that you're not allowed to breed with
them I can take any two seeds and cross them at this state of the industry and
suddenly I've got a novel chemo var and I can patent it yes and one of the blogs
on plant law calm is it answered the title is how can I tell if my strain I
think I use the word strain there how can I tell if my strain is new and
different enough for patenting and my answer to that in the blog is if you
made it and it's a new it's a new result of a sexual cross it's by definition
different and distinct enough for patenting and you know that it's new the
question is always going to just be is it worth patenting many things that you
produce are not going to be you know if you do a cross you'll have thousands of
seeds you'll grow many of those out and decide which ones have the phenotype
that you want and then you'll save you know a small handful of those as your
special results of that cross and you may do some more crossing and some more
selection but when you finally have something that you think is going to
have commercial value for years that's when you think about patenting it and if
you think it's going to have commercial value for years then you know you're
going to grow that plant you're going to do some back crossing you're going to
try to stabilize the seed line as much as you can try to get it as homozygous
as you can without losing all the traits that you're after and when you have a
stable seed line that's probably when that's what you would probably want to
try to commercialize and that's probably the appropriate time to try to
patent it and that is you know you are going to if you're doing seeds you do
need to be able to say that the seeds of this particular cultivar are
substantially stable and that they're substantially true to type and so you
know if you have a segregating population that wouldn't even count as a
as a cultivar per se but but the real question of is it new it's it's new
because every sexual cross is new you know and and is it distinct even you and
your siblings are different from each other even though you came from the same
parents and it's the same with every seed okay am but going into the future
as utility patents on seeds become more common the the breeder is going to also
have to ask does does the original breeder of this seed that I'm crossing
already have an existing utility patent on it which would restrict me from
breeding it right that's right and of course if they want to assert their
rights they need to label their product and so if someone is selling patented
seed there would be a patent number on the label and that's when you'd have to
respect the utility patent so if you don't see a patent on the label chances
are it's not patented and even if it is that the patent owner isn't doing what
they need to do to put the public on notice and you would have a defense to
infringement and now of course if you if you later got notice and you kept
breeding that'd be a different different problem right on I follow that and so
let's take that one more step farther so if we want to lock down our genetics
even further I would think that the next step would be doing you know kind
of a strategy like some of these seed companies are where they are developing
chemo bars and honestly no no they're not they're not just clones but but but
where they're selling seeds in bulk to for example hemp folks where they'll buy
5,000 seeds but it comes with a license that you won't breed or share so that is
that is kind of creating a safety zone for those seeds but not involving the US
Patent Office that's right that's that's really creating a system where your
recourse against someone who violates that is a breach of the agreement under
which you sold them the seeds the problem with that is so you know if I
sell seeds that are restricted I say you're allowed to use these seeds for
growing plants to grow harvested material I can't stop you from breeding
with these seeds unless unless I only sell that maybe I sell that under terms
where I say you're not allowed to breed with these seeds and your purchase of
these seeds is an acknowledgement of an agreement between us that you won't
breed with these seeds then if someone did go ahead and breed with those seeds
or did try to sell you know a second generation of those seeds without your
permission and that was all in the contract you'd be able to go after them
for breach of contract and again that comes to the problem of what about the
person downstream from that agreement what if someone else gets their hands on
those seeds and they have a defensive of not being a party to that agreement not
being aware of the agreement and so yeah you can you you can have agreements like
a shrink-wrapped license in the software industry that restrict what people do
with seeds you sell but unless you can show that that the person that that
accepted those terms when they bought the seeds is the person that is violating
those terms that's you know you're not you can't sue someone for breach of
contract if they're not the party to the contract and that's the problem.
Wow that that right there is such a messy thing to have it turn on right
because you know some of my favorite seed companies are licensing their seeds
because the material is so unique and and I do I actually believe they should
be able to charge to to pay for the research and the significant part of
their life that they put into developing them but they can really only enforce it
against the people they had the licenses if somebody they had a license with
gave it to a friend surreptitiously they can only sue the person they had the
license with not their friend that took it and crossed it with something else
that's I would call that a big gaping hole. It is and that's that's why people
choose to plug that hole with a patent and you know one of my sayings I use a
lot is if you're a hammer everything looks like a nail and if you're a patent
attorney you can fall into the trap of thinking the solution to every problem
is a patent and I don't want to sound like that I I try to learn what people
want to accomplish and then help them accomplish that in a way that's most
consistent with their needs and their goals and their budget so I don't always
recommend patent protection but if you're working with biological organisms
that that self reproduce and that are so easy to reproduce in large quantities if
you're if you're free to do so not having some kind of a backstop of
intellectual property rights just means that you've got to have much tighter
control in other aspects of your business plan there's just no no other
way around it right now I'm advocating a new system that would change that but
but the current system just doesn't it doesn't give you recourse against anyone
who's not a party to the agreements that you made great and I'm glad that you
mentioned your new system because this is where I want to go next but before we
do you go there we have talked a lot of vigorities back and forth and I just
like would like your bulleted action points for somebody who is listening and
they are breeding their own seeds what is the best thing that they can do right
now to protect themselves as this evolves just give me the short version
so so that they can write it down and have a task list first thing is to make
sure you're you're selling your seeds with some kind of restrictions on the
label and that you make that sale as conditional as possible try to sell only
to trustworthy parties and if you can't do that and you value those seeds and
you think they'll have commercial value for a long time the bad news is you
really do need a patent and it needs to be a utility patent okay and I think
that that probably describes just about everybody in the seed game so then what
are the next steps they take to do that and let me just let me just amend that
if if it's industrial hemp then you have two options you've got utility patent or
plant-friendly protection certificate but there are some reasons not to do PVP
including that there's an express exemption that permits people to breed
with the seeds that they obtain that are protected that way so it still goes back
to utility patent the steps are if you want a utility patent make sure that you
that you get an application filed within a year of the first the first
public availability of the seeds or any part any any part of the plant so you've
got to move relatively quickly make sure that you're working with someone that
knows what they're doing find out how many plant patents they've filed before
or not even plant patents but utility patents relating to plants and you know
just just make sure that you are getting what you pay for when it comes
to getting the legal advice that you need okay so so let's talk about this
new idea that you've put together for a new spirited international convention
that would protect nearly all the people who are breeding cannabis plants because
it certainly got me excited listening to it and it sounds like a really great way
for to bring everybody together for the good of the availability of the plant
and honestly it feels a lot like open source the more you and I talked about
it so so go ahead and give us the the elevator speech if you will yeah I have
been an advocate I've been sympathetic at least to open source and I advocate
it's used for people who want to use it it's not for everybody but the problem
the biggest problem with open source in plant genetics is its contrast with or
is demonstrated by contrasting it with with computer software software open
source works because software has an automatic copyright the moment it's
created you don't have to apply for a copyright the problem with open source
in plant genetics is that there is no automatic right that exists upon
creating a new genetic selection you have to go apply for that you have to
pay for it and so the analogy between open source software and open source
plant genetics breaks down at this point where a copyright infringement is a form
of recourse you can use against someone who never agreed to your the conditions
of your open source software situation but if you create an open source seed
sharing or genetic sharing community and someone is outside that agreement and
you don't have underlying IP rights to assert against them you don't have
anything to assert against them because you can't go after them for breaching
your agreement they weren't a party to your agreement and so what I'm
advocating is a form of plant breeders right that is very similar to a copyright
and now copyrights exist upon creation of an original work because there there
was an International Convention or there still is called the Berne Convention
that was established in 1896 or 1886 I think and the the US I don't remember
86 96 whatever but the US joined it a hundred and two years later and so as of
that date copyrights in the US were automatically protected I think it was
it was 86 and 88 so in 1988 the US finally joined the Berne Convention and
copyrights became automatically protectable as soon as you created an
original work now what I'm advocating is something very much like the Berne
Convention for plant breeders so that when you create an original cross and
you make a selection and you you establish a cultivar that you don't have
to apply for any form of protection it's already there it's there like a
copyright and someone who violates that by illicitly obtaining and propagating
your genetic selection would be in violation just the same as someone who
illicitly obtained some software code and commercialize that that's what I'm
advocating it's gonna take some work but I think there are enough people who
would benefit from this and enough people who care about it that I don't
intend for this just to be talk so if if every single seed is unique and you're
talking about giving everybody who's plant breeding default protection how
does that drill down to the uniqueness of every individual seed that's a great
question and if you if you read the blog that I wrote about open source one
of the headings is my dad is such a pain lol now the reason that's relevant is
that anything we ever write anything we ever write that is original is protected
by copyright but that doesn't mean we commercialize we do anything with most
of those copyrights every email you've written today and my example in the blog
is everything my kids text on their phones practically is copyright protected
unless it's completely unoriginal like my dad is such a pain lol that's not
original enough to qualify for copyright because my kids were not the first ones
to type that in a text even if they type it a lot so the point is that there's
there's a there's more copyright protected material out there in the
world that's being created every second than anyone is ever going to do anything
with in terms of asserting their legal rights but the fact that that protection
is automatic gives you all kinds of latitude if you write a blog or if you
write software or if you you know whatever whatever kind of creation you
you do whatever kind of creative activity that that is protectable by
copyright you've got that just by having created it and by analogy you know if you
think about all the text that people write that might be analogous to all the
diversity that is in a single batch of seeds every one of those seeds would be
protectable would be would be under the basically the basic breeders right but
what they choose to do with that is another thing how many people how many
things do we have that are copyright protected that we never care to assert
our rights over but if something in there is really valuable the difference
between a text that you send and a book that you write then you're going to have
some rights that you do care to assert but you still don't have to go apply for
those rights now let's extend that let's apply that to an open source system if
every breeder that puts something into an open source system already had a
right to assert against someone who used their their genetics without permission
then an open source system would work because within the system you'd say all
right we're gonna share seeds under conditions we've all got rights under
these see these seeds but we're gonna share them under conditions that you
will do you know this and that and you won't do this other thing with these
seeds or that if you do this other thing let's say if you if you commercialize
something that that was derived from these genetics that you have to pay
something back into a fund that protects everyone from patent infringement
litigation or something like that so you can put conditions on the use of those
seeds and if everyone had protection of their genetic varieties that was
automatic then anyone who illicitly obtained those seeds and did something
that was outside the open source system you'd have recourse against them just
like people have recourse against against a copyright infringer so it
plugs the hole that exists we've talked about the fact that you can't sue
someone for contract for breach of contract if they're not a party to that
contract but you can sue someone for breach of an intellectual property right
without ever having a contract with them that's a really interesting and engaging
idea the fact that if if every seed that is bread is automatically protected it
opens us up to be able to more casually share the seeds with other seed makers
because we don't really have to worry about what they're doing with it and so
it's it reminds me that old phrase fences make good neighbors well it's
like if everybody who's breeding already has got protections for their stuff but
people generally don't mind if other people are breeding with their seeds as
well then everybody kind of is this is on equal footing which I think most is
what most breeders want I think most breeders just don't want their work
you served right people recoil at the notion of having everything just just
dripping with intellectual property because it's new to them and it sounds
like that's just overkill but the real overkill the real problem is the
difficulty and expense of getting the intellectual property protection because
once you have it you're free to do whatever you want with it including just
leave it there and not not assert it at all we're not we're not troubled by the
automatic nature of copyright protection I would say that plant breeding is at
least as much a creative activity as writing is you know certainly not not
all plant breeding results are created equal and not all writing is created
equal but it's all protected by copyright and it hasn't made you know
planes fall out of the sky and and disaster happen all over the place so
it's it's it's a little bit foreign and in a way it's counterintuitive just like
you said all of these rights that everyone have has would actually make it
safer and easier to share what we have because it would it would give us a way
to kind of sift between the people who are willing to play by some some basic
rules of respect and trustworthiness and still have some recourse against people
who aren't willing to do that someone who comes in and and takes what you've
got and then commercializes it and and does something you don't approve of or
whatever you're gonna have some recourse against them all right so I see one more
big challenge to this the first one of course being this this you know keeping
it in balance protecting myself while wanting to share with you and and I and
I like your I like your answer to that but as we've seen time and time again
well-funded folks are are just pushing low-funded folks to go to settlement and
not really getting their day in court just simply because they can outspend
them legally how would a small person in your or under finance person in your
system defend their automatic patent on their seeds well that that kind of
depends on if they're trying to assert their rights against against someone who
is who's using their seeds without permission that's a challenge because
they're you know the you face you face different challenges when you're
asserting your your rights than when someone is asserting their rights against
you you you basically you've got to fund the litigation up front and if the abuse
is bad enough then you may be able to recover damages one thing that I've
advocated in addition to this open source system which is more about
defending against abusive patent suits against defending people who are who are
sued for infringing an abusive patent is a system of mutual defense and but that
is about defending against being sued for an abusive you know an abusive
overbroad patent that we that the community has already come to the
decision come to the conclusion that is invalid and should be fought so I do
advocate in a blog that I wrote called standing up to big AG a mutual defense
approach where it's kind of like NATO you know if you sue any of our members
we're going to band together and use all of our patents to see if there's any
of our patents that we own that we could counter sue against you for infringing
our patent that's better described in the blog than we have time for in this
situation but basically it's a mutual defense approach and we are actually I'm
I don't like to just write about things and not put them into action I am trying
to form some kind of a coalition of United small cannabis companies and and
individual breeders that can create that kind of mutual defense in the event that
one of them gets sued for patent infringement it's harder to put together
a mutual offensive approach just because it's it's it's harder to insure against
it's harder for it to get insurance for that kind of outcome but it could still
happen and I think depending on how you fund the open source system you know if
if the open source system has some kind of fund that people who infringe it have
to you know if the let's say the the the damages that come from an infringement
of an open source system if those damages went into a fund that could then
be used to further assert the rights against you know just the people who
violate the system that's a pretty sensible thing to do with with proceeds
from an open source fund but those are really two different things the mutual
defense against offense against being sued for infringement of an overbroad
utility patent is kind of a separate institution separate animal from the
the open source and open automatic rights approach all right I follow that
and so so a lot please allow me to distill this down to see if I've got
this right so so what you're proposing is kind of like this this this two-part
one-two punch thing on the first thing that we need to do is to set up an
international convention so that there is a default setting that when breeders
and it sounds like you're talking about all plants but since we're talking
cannabis where where cannabis breeders the moment they make the cross and they
have resultant seeds those are by default defended by a patent and so that
creates the protections that most everybody is needing and then your
second is let's pull these newly protected breeders together into some
kind of cannabis breeders Union and and call ourselves an organization and you
know pay some sort of yearly fee that will go to litigation insurance so that
if any one of us is having to defend ourselves we are able to turn on the
turn to the insurance policy so that all of all of we lesser funded cannabis
folks are able to represent ourselves the same way that NATO if one country
gets attacked everybody comes to their defense is that do my close that's
pretty close I would just I would correct not even correct I just amend
one thing that you said about you know the automatic protection for plant
breeders it wouldn't be a patent because patents get applied for and they get
examined and they have certain rights it would be more like a copyright that
is that that is automatic and it's basically just a prohibition it's not
something you can write claims for and that you that you if copyrights are
inherently available but they're they're not as I'd say they're not as usually
complicated or strong as patent rights per se and so what I'm advocating for is
a really basic breeders right that but that gives you some recourse against
someone who would in infringe your your rights all you'd have to do is just show
that yeah this is your this is your product your your selection your the
result of your breeding and that someone has in front has had someone's taken it
that the DNA matches and therefore you have a right to stop them from from
making further use of it in a way that would be very similar to a patent but it
would just be I don't think you'd want to use the term patent because that
implies that it's gone through this whole process of that's right where I'm
going so it's not really a patent or a copyright it is not a patent but it's
kind of like a patent but it's not and it's and it's kind of like copyright but
it's not a copyright it's some third thing yeah I'm advocating the creation
of a natural plant breeders right to the selections and you know the crosses and
the selections that that breeder makes that would be equivalent to a copyright
it wouldn't be the same as a patent but it would give the breeder the right to
control what people do with that production just the same as a writer has
the right to control what people do with his or her written work you know as as
you roll this out and you and you start to make this real you're gonna have to
find yourself a new vocabulary right because patent the word is not only not
what you're doing but it's packed with all of these expectations and and such
from people and then it's also not copyright and it's also not open source
and so what you're creating is an animal that we have not seen in cannabis so far
and I think I think that you need some new vocabulary man yeah we do and and
but the whole reason to do this is to facilitate open source it's to make it
so that you you can have recourse against people who are not parties to
your open source agreement if they're if they're violating your open source terms
without ever having agreed to them it gives you a recourse just like people
have a recourse against copyright infringers that's the whole point of it
and there may be some other things that people could do with it but the main the
reason I came up with this idea is that it it would it would make open source
workable and I want to see open source be workable so it's it's explained in
more detail in the blog that I wrote about that and then in terms of the
mutual defense fund it is it would be really a group that purchases some kind
of group litigation insurance I've done some preliminary pricing on this and I
I don't have a strong enough commitment on the pricing to be able to quote it or
anything but the idea would be that yes you have a coalition that forms an
organization that buys this group insurance and that the group insurance
covers people who get sued for patent infringement so that they have just as
big a patent and patent litigation war chest as the people who are suing them
so that the size disparity goes away and then there's also a mutual commitment by
members of this organization that if they have a patent that this other that
this that this opponent is is infringing that the defendant can use this other
organization members patent against them just and it is in a way analogous to
NATO that you know you point your guns at me everybody on my team's guns point
back at you and so we hopefully don't shoot each other we decide to find a way
to settle our differences obviously this would need to be administered by some
kind of a nonprofit and but I think that once once we had an idea of how many
members were interested in that and what the insurance rates would be then you
basically charge a fee that covers that plus maybe the cost of one administrator
and then you have a mutual defense that's workable it it's not something
that I that I would advocate doing on a for-profit basis just because we have so
many trust issues in this industry already if someone thought this was just
a scheme to make money I don't think people would want to be part of it but
if we see that see it as an answer to the balance that the imbalance of power
between big cannabis or big AG and a bunch of small cannabis people who still
want to be able to stay in business they don't want to have to consolidate they
don't want to have to sell to a big company they want to be able to stand
and and and do what they're doing and and not not be at the mercy of this huge
imbalance of power that the way to do that would be to form a coalition that
actually has teeth in it that can provide a mutual defense in the event
that some of these overbroad patents get asserted against one member of the
community so Dale just because I know you a bit I know that this is actually
kind of a activist kind of heart taking thing that you're taking on and yet most
of the listeners including me you know like we're stoners who know about pipe
dreams right and so what can you tell us that that would encourage people to pay
attention to what you're doing or think that this is reasonable that this has
come together instead of just being a really great story to tell over a bowl
well I think the the the answer always has to be watch what people do and not
just what they say do cut them some slack in terms of getting things done
and if you're not sure whether they're real or not talk to them and offer to
help and you know if someone if if someone thinks that I'm floating these
ideas just for fun or just to give people kind of a like a temporary pipe
dream or something talk to me reach out to me ask how you can help because I do
want to I do want to turn these things into action I have become a bit of an
activist even though I still run a law firm and have to pay bills and things
like that a lot of what I do and care about the most is not really tied to
anything that I can bill anybody for in my law firm I just want to see things
work well enough that everybody in this industry prospers and achieves their
their goals well Dale this has been great and I really appreciate meeting an
attorney who I find both personable or divine personable skilled and on my side
and usually I don't get all three in the same so so thank you very much for
spending your valuable time with us helping us get to the bottom of these
two biotech and United Cannabis patents that people are talking about a lot but
didn't really understand very well and kind of bringing this up to the state of
the art or the state of play of where cannabis patents are today because we
really just want to protect ourselves and it sounds like our best play is
going to be to continually work together so I've a I'm pretty sure that
we're gonna have you back on again because this has been great to hear your
experience and put so succinctly so thanks a lot Dale I really appreciate it
it was my pleasure thank you so if you want to follow up with Dale there's two
