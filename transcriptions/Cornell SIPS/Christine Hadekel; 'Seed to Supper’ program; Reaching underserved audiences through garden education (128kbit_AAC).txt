[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Marcia, for that very
thoughtful and kind introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, Don, for the invitation to
come all this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very special for me to be coming back
full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to many seminars in this room as
a staff person in the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: department 10 years ago, as a graduate
student about six years ago, and now to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to be able to share my own story
around the work that I am doing in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very meaningful opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Marcia said, I am the statewide
education and outreach manager at Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Food Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of my role, I oversee all of
our statewide nutrition, garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and health care partnerships that we do
across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start with this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many of you have read it or heard
it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, this really encapsulates the
essence of the program that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to you about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to explaining how
really starting with the people,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, living with them, loving them,
being with them, and building with them is
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that we can really engage with
other sort of communities and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start really from the
beginning, which is hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Oregon Food Bank's mission is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ending the root causes of hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really believe that hunger is an
income issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue of a lack of food
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our world has an abundance of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon is a state that produces 220
different food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, we are the sixth state in the
nation with the highest rate of hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: 220 different types of food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are just an abundance of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, 16% of the population in Oregon
don't have enough to eat and are food
[SPEAKER_00]: insecure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food insecurity is really the heartbeat of
what we are working towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at not only food security
from the UN definition, but from a variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many of you have heard this term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the closest grocery store?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parts of Oregon where people have
to drive over two and a half hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours, to get to a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eastern parts of the state is very
rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's parts of Portland, a very urban
center, where people have to take two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three buses, urban food deserts,
just to get to a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking not only at the official
definition of food security, but looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at all these different levels of
determining how people are getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: food access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some stats for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest states of food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Oregon on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16.1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the past two years, we are actually
the highest state in the whole country in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of a surge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at surge in food insecurity,
Oregon is number one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fueling cause of that is the
housing crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rising cost of housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, income, low wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Income inequality and low wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are at 13, around 13%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data is taken from Feeding America,
which is the national organization for
[SPEAKER_00]: food banks across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go on to Feeding America's
website and actually drill down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual counties where you might be
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wonderful website called Map the
Meal Gap that they developed, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can drill right down and look at the
demographics in your own county to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: food insecurity might look a little bit
different as you get closer to the
[SPEAKER_00]: community level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So food banks have been around a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a new concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really emerged during a time when
there was surplus food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the government didn't know what to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were looking for an outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so food banks have, over time,
emerged from being simply a food
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor of surplus food towards trying
to look more holistically at a food system
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what the real issues are around
driving hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many food banks are still operating in
this model of just being a distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many food banks just pick up cans of food,
frozen food, go to a grocery store that
[SPEAKER_00]: might have leftover cans of food on a
shelf that are about to expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are that stopgap role of
collecting any surplus and getting it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: pantry that needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of food banks are shifting to
what we are now calling Food Banking 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food Banking of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I think my PowerPoint is on
autoplay somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just keep an eye on the slides as
they're shifting along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Food Banking 2.0 is really about
looking at a food system holistically to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at what are the real causes of hunger
and what role can food banks play beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: just giving out food to organize their
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the old model here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers have extra zucchini in their
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pick it up, put it on a truck,
get it out to a regional food bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: send it out to a food pantry, and get it
into a client's home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the old model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at now is working at
the state level with policies around
[SPEAKER_00]: wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an adequate minimum wage so that
folks have the income they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Working at the community organizing level,
getting farmers to talk to business
[SPEAKER_00]: owners, school administrators to talk to
farmers, trying to link all different
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of a community together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mark Winnie asks in his wonderful book,
Closing the Food Gap, what could the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of food banks be if all the energy
that we put into distributing food was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put into ending hunger and
poverty?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very profound question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pouring millions of dollars into
just shipping food around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a band-aid solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not looking at the root causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oregon Food Bank is working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have local food banks in New York
State who are also working around
[SPEAKER_00]: community organizing, advocacy,
and public policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are critical to shifting the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm here to talk specifically about
what we're doing around gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening education not only provides
fresh access to produce, but also skills,
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence, and resources to really help
people move through economic hardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a learning garden at our food bank
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful garden that not only
provides people access to food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really fosters relationships and hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hope, you know, it's a funny term that
we throw around a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hope, in this context, when someone is
just trying to figure out how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the end of the month with just
maybe a jar of peanut butter and a shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, hope can go a long way in getting
someone through a hard month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gardens are not only providing a
context for fostering relationships and
[SPEAKER_00]: building confidence and resilience,
but also providing meaningful amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our small little garden, we produced
30,000 pounds of fresh organic produce to
[SPEAKER_00]: give out to pantries last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in one tiny little garden,
we had over 10,000 volunteers come through
[SPEAKER_00]: our garden last year to help grow that
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting every seed in the greenhouse,
transplanting every transplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting, and sharing that with food
pantries and clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And food banks like this are doing this
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to convert plots of land
to be able to provide access to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also programs that we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two programs that operate on a
national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant a Row and Ample Harvest are two
wonderful programs that specifically help
[SPEAKER_00]: to connect surplus of produce to food
pantries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about these programs is
that they'll not only map a community to
[SPEAKER_00]: show what pantries accept what types of
produce, but they'll say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this pantry has a higher demographic of
African Americans who like collard greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this has a higher Latino clientele who
would appreciate cilantro or chili
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting down to that fine level of detail
to look at what produce is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful, rather than just saying we're
going to provide you with potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of whether that's your cultural
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being very sensitive and attuned to
what produce is actually helpful for
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also dedicated some of our land to
an intertribal garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working with several First Nations
groups on our land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1850, all of the land in Oregon within
seven years was taken from First Nations
[SPEAKER_00]: communities and given to white settlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the land in the state was given up
through the Land Donation Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this garden is symbolic in helping to
rebuild relationships with our local
[SPEAKER_00]: Native American communities and provide a
learning space for people to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional foods, for elders to come and
teach about their traditional foods and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed-saving practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a huge problem of
gentrification in Portland, as many cities
[SPEAKER_00]: are now seeing across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image on the left is from the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker colors or the number of high
population of African Americans living in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see within 20 years how they were
pushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within 20 years, the food bank is right in
the middle of that dense red area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working now with a coalition of
African American farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given over our entire farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of our farm next to our
food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given over the land of our farm to
the Black Food Sovereignty Council so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can start an agricultural hub for
African American farmers to teach them
[SPEAKER_00]: about reclaiming their heritage around
agriculture, transforming it from being a
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage connected to cotton picking and
slavery and reclaiming what their own
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional foods are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're being very mindful of the land
that we're on and how we can use it as an
[SPEAKER_00]: asset to provide to other communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food banks are also moving into this fear
of being a garden resource center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributing access to starts,
seeds, fertilizer, row cover, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: would need to get a garden started.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a critical role that food banks
can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to be connecting people to
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started growing plant starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing about 15,000 plant starts
now that we're giving out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is playing a huge role in helping
people to plant their own gardens that
[SPEAKER_00]: they wouldn't have income to purchase
plant starts for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also supporting food pantry gardens
by mobilizing large amounts of volunteers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get thousands of volunteers coming
through the food bank system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can redirect those volunteers to
food pantry gardens so that when clients
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to pick up their food at a local
pantry, they can help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volunteers can help out in the garden and
learn right on site when they're coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: get their monthly box of other produce or
vegetables or canned goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a huge interest in food
gardening across the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wonderful report that came out
through the National Gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have probably seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just documents just what a huge
upsurge there has been in the last decade
[SPEAKER_00]: in food gardening specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that demand come through our
clients to the food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also been a tremendous recognition
of the benefits of food gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just only for health reasons,
for nutrition reasons, but for mental
[SPEAKER_00]: health and for creating social
connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, with this demand, we also
realized so many of the programs that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist were very expensive, were time
consuming, and were far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that are asking for
gardening and who could benefit from them
[SPEAKER_00]: most were not able to come to the programs
that existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Portland, we have apprenticeship
programs for urban farming, but all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Master Gardener program requires a
huge time commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for folks that are working two or three
jobs, single parents, working tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of hours per week who don't know
have any additional income to spare,
[SPEAKER_00]: these programs were very prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what led to the creation of
Seed to Supper, was this sort of surge in
[SPEAKER_00]: demand, and at the same time, all of these
restrictions and people being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn and gain skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we launched the Seed to Supper
program in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Spanish name of the program is Siembra
de Hacena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a program that's coordinated in
collaboration between food banks,
[SPEAKER_00]: food pantries, and cooperative extensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what a unique partnership model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think it wouldn't be that
innovative, and you'd think that food
[SPEAKER_00]: banks and extension would have been
working together already, but what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found is they're not even talking to each
other, even in tiny little rural
[SPEAKER_00]: communities where they might have offices
next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even know each other's names,
let alone collaborate on shared
[SPEAKER_00]: programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working to offer free gardening
education classes through this dynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have classes that are offered to all
income levels, all abilities, and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in gardening with the idea of
filling that gap that exists, that gap of
[SPEAKER_00]: adult ed programming specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of curriculum out there for
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just Google gardening education
kids, and you get a plethora of curricula
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you try to find adult gardening ed,
there's almost nothing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you try to put a lens of working
with low income audiences, focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal input, minimal resource,
approach to gardening, even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we developed this curricula,
with that lens in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: An audience that is not going to have $200
to go to Home Depot to buy extra tools
[SPEAKER_00]: that they might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are not even going to be able to
afford soil for a container garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are real challenges that people are
facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you approach gardening in that
context?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the topics that we
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you prepare a site?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you choose which crops might be
appropriate for your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you care for your gardening and
then harvest the bounty?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's slides associated with the
curricula that we developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slides are meant to just be visual
aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: To assist in the learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photos that really just emphasize key
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: DIY watering can, really trying to
emphasize do-it-yourself approaches that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't require going to the store to buy an
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do if you can't afford an
organic fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you still be successful and grow
on your own food when you only have $16 at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the month to spare?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're choosing, do you pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your gas bill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you buy some groceries?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reality of the people that
we're teaching gardening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program is designed to have a flexible
learning environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some classes are taught indoors via
PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are right outdoors in the garden,
hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that people learn best hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the image on the right is really what
all of our programs are aspiring to is
[SPEAKER_00]: having place-based garden education.
[SPEAKER_00]: The participants come from all
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have about 8 to 15 per class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a variety of reasons for
attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone is there because they are
looking how to grow kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some are actually coming because
it's the only time in their week when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be around other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poverty creates a tremendous amount of
social isolation, which is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we did not realize until we started this
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just how much people were benefiting by
just simply being around others in
[SPEAKER_00]: community once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reasons for attending have been
very helpful for us in looking at how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can adjust our model to really address
what people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give all sorts of giveaways to
participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them a book about gardening,
trowels, fertilizer, a certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: completion, you know, things to get them
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: On their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the places where there are
stars is where the program is now
[SPEAKER_00]: operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in 20 counties across the whole
state out of 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it mushroomed up within a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done any recruitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been counties coming to us
saying, please, we need this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us start it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the demand has been tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been having a hard time keeping
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in terms of the history of how the
program developed, it was started in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: For five years, we taught the program just
in Portland, Oregon, just in the city,
[SPEAKER_00]: and took all of the evaluation and data
from participants, from instructors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and worked with Oregon State University
Extension Program to co-brand and design
[SPEAKER_00]: this seed to separate curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2012, we relaunched the
curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In collaboration with Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master gardeners received approval to have
their hours teaching seed to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: count towards the master gardener hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We translated into Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began to expand across Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2015, we began to expand
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now in North Carolina, New York
State, Kentucky, Texas, Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: With many more states coming on board and
showing interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So future plans for the program include
continued national expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that national expansion,
really developing a professional learning
[SPEAKER_00]: community so that we can really,
together as a country, look at what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the most appropriate models for bridging,
extension, and food banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two organizations that have national
scope and local reach and that just
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a perfect opportunity to work
together if we can figure out the right
[SPEAKER_00]: model for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also continuing to look at
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some preliminary evaluation,
but we're really looking at how we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: a more rigorous impact evaluation across
states in collaboration with New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at process evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just the impact, but how do we on a
day to day really tweak this process of
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're training our educators to teach,
tweak the relationship building so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can be most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also adapting the program to
multilingual audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Portland, we have about 13 languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have more than 13, but 13 that
are actively, widely spoken across the
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burmese, Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese,
Somali, Swahili.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working now to adapt this
program and the curricula to those
[SPEAKER_00]: languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was two counties in Oregon that did
an evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a large increase in the number
of participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everyone said that they ate
vegetables from their garden after taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost everyone reported that they
were able to reduce food costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a big plus of the savings that
they can get on their food bill through
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them really talked about the
impact that the program had on their
[SPEAKER_00]: family and on their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aside from the nutritious health
benefits, aside from the reduced food bill
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, really it came down to,
again, social connection and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: One participant said that the class gave
them encouragement to share the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: food with their family and friends and
inspired them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at horticultural skills and gain
employment in the horticulture field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are teaching this program in many
correctional institutions and prisons
[SPEAKER_00]: across Oregon, working with inmates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had several inmates get released and
then begin horticulture training programs
[SPEAKER_00]: and horticulture positions working on
farms using the skills that they gained in
[SPEAKER_00]: this course.
[SPEAKER_00]: This course is also used as a gateway to a
12-week intensive gardening program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a course that's offered through
Oregon State Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they graduate from this one and then
can take the larger 12-week course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they have those two certificates,
when they're released from prison,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are able usually to get a job with a
horticulture employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really made a difference in
creating a sense of community for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had another inmate who was released,
and she's now started sort of a halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: garden so that when women are released,
they have a place to land in Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a garden to work at when they're
reentering society.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show a short video now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Dewey.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from the Klamath tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is a seed to supper instructor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really short video that
talks about his experience getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening and becoming a seed to supper
instructor.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dewey James Moore, Sr. I am 35
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in foster care my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a son.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be 11 this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a combat veteran with the Marines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent five years in the Marines.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I was in the Marines, I went into
the Oregon Army National Guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in the Marines in 2000 as a field
radio operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never imagined going into combat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 9-11 happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thrown all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just felt lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through counseling for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I planted some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called four clocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I went through and I planted those
seeds, I felt like that jigsaw puzzle that
[SPEAKER_01]: was my soul started to come back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the feel of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like my hands are getting a
massage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like my whole soul is getting
massage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I started to get into
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like I'm healing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started getting involved with the
Klamath Sustainable Community Gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a garden down the street from my
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I called them up and told them I
wanted a plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Asked them if they had any plots
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next year I asked if they needed a
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they needed any help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that usually don't see each other
or talk to each other, they seem to get
[SPEAKER_01]: along around plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taught the seed to separate classes
in Chiloquin, Oregon, in Beatty,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon, and Klamath Falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like about teaching is when people
come in saying, wow, I planted these seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how big this plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look how beautiful it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son has been to almost all the seed to
separate courses I've taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he even has been through a full
80-hour course of permaculture design with
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is stevia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad said it's 300 times sweeter than
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tastes really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and that is one way I have a deep
connection and deep bond with my son is
[SPEAKER_01]: through gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we all went through and garden and grew
food together and ate food together,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems like the world would be much
happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of energy that goes
into bringing a plant into the world and
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of it, watering it,
fertilizing it, and harvesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That feels very nourishing to my soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why I'll be doing it
for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't for gardening, I don't think
I would be here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were ready to die in combat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get out, you feel like you're
still ready to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm more ready to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that video can be found online on the
Oregon Food Bank website if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in viewing it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, Dewey represents an
opportunity for master gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Vilsack, agriculture secretary,
said, master gardeners are a valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: resource for people who want to get some
tips on growing their own food from a real
[SPEAKER_00]: expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dewey is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master gardeners, though, generally,
he's an exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, nationally, there is a lack of
diversity amongst master gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a limited number that want to
commit to vegetable gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a limited number that feel
comfortable working in diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, low-income communities,
and a limited number that actually speak
[SPEAKER_00]: other languages of the clients that we're
serving in these classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a challenge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a real opportunity for
exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an extension to be shifting that
and partnering with food banks to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that, shifting it so that master gardeners
can start to get hours for teaching about
[SPEAKER_00]: food, beginning to gain more training and
cultural competency and equity,
[SPEAKER_00]: these really important skills that now are
becoming more recognized across the nation
[SPEAKER_00]: as being critical to any educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even skills around how to be a teacher,
just because you know how to grow food and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an expert in horticulture doesn't
mean that you can communicate that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that will translate and be effective
to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving training on how to teach,
providing a new way to teach through a new
[SPEAKER_00]: curricula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the ways that Seed to
Suffer is shifting how master gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: can engage with the food gardening
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My talk was called Engaging Underserved
Audiences through Garden Education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use underserved a lot, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thrown around in the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many ways that you can
consider who is underserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we look at underserved in terms of
these different demographic pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just income, not just who's under
the poverty line, but also who has limited
[SPEAKER_00]: literacy, who's living in a food desert in
a geographic location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are critical factors when we're
looking about where we're placing our
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at all of these to determine
which audiences are most underserved and
[SPEAKER_00]: could be benefiting from the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are identifying a lot of community
assets and community barriers as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: our process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are convening community
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program called FEAST,
Food, Education, Agriculture Solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FEAST curricula is online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to bring community members
together to have conversations around
[SPEAKER_00]: their program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a shorter version of FEAST
called Community Conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a process to identify
community assets and barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that any time we enter a new
county before launching Seed to Suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned some best practices around
engaging underserved audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is really ensuring that any
document, anything that we're using is
[SPEAKER_00]: translated into the local language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask any food bank that's working with
a diverse population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable how many documents are
not available in languages other than
[SPEAKER_00]: English, even in predominantly
Spanish-speaking communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So language is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second is strict enforcement of civil
rights, particularly in this era of fear
[SPEAKER_00]: that we are now living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our food pantry members,
he was actually our pantry manager,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a DACA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Child and was taken by ICE, brought to the
Tacoma Detention Center just a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civil rights is a real issue in the
communities that we're working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not coming to classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Latino instructors that are too
fearful to go outside, too fearful to come
[SPEAKER_00]: to a public place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civil rights is showing itself in a new
way in our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having to re-envision what it
looks like to have public education in a
[SPEAKER_00]: climate where people are too afraid to go
out of their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural competency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a term that's thrown around a
lot and really needs to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: mindfully considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you're sending people out into,
from extension perspective, how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending people out into communities and
the responsibility that that carries and
[SPEAKER_00]: what skills we can provide them with,
what practice and skills we can provide
them with.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be competent in working with
communities that are different from their
[SPEAKER_00]: own experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been partnering a lot with
culturally specific organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with Native American
organizations, African American coalition,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Somali women's group to offer
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with groups that are already
connected in the communities and know the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, know what time frame will work
best, know the type of methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: instruction methods, and approaches that
would work best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with a lot of
gatekeepers, providing events for free,
[SPEAKER_00]: using simple activities that will engage
people rather than overly complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: lecture format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really inviting people into the
conversation so that they're not just
[SPEAKER_00]: participants, but designers in the
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a lot of participants to
come back as instructors and become back
[SPEAKER_00]: as mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they don't know a lot about
gardening, over the years they'll get it
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the skill that they bring is
their skill of their own lived experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really helps to have that
beginner's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That beginner's perspective of knowing the
challenges of just even simple language,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, like a garden bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not a gardener, you wouldn't
even know what a bed means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadcasting fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broadcasting over the radio.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does broadcasting mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many terms that we use in
horticulture that seem simple and obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: to us because we're gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for anyone who has never done that,
never planted a seed, what does it mean to
[SPEAKER_00]: thin something?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: To sow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're working with a
non-English audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these terms like to sow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really providing the skills to
translate all of that information to other
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spend a lot of time working with
Extension just in teaching them and
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing to get to know their audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds simple, but I can't tell you how
many times we failed at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offered classes in urban Portland where
80% of the class was container gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't talk about it once.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked the whole time about
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening in the ground, preparing your
bed, double digging techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wasn't until after the program was
over that the instructors learned that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much everyone there lived in an
apartment on the 25th floor with no access
[SPEAKER_00]: to a garden in the ground, and they wanted
to learn how to contain a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that simple step of getting to know
your audience was missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds obvious, but we see this
happening over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of engaging with audiences,
we found it takes a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to build trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only now in certain communities where
we've been working, offering this program
[SPEAKER_00]: for several years to be there,
and it takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes going to events that are not
directly related to gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're just showing up as a
community member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having just your face, be a familiar face
in the community makes all the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindfulness in teaching, creating a
welcoming environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of mindfulness training with
our instructors to help them understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what it means to not make assumptions
about their participants, to really
[SPEAKER_00]: inquire, be curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one would you call that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you call it an eggplant,
a brinjal, or an aubergine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you call that a zucchini?
[SPEAKER_00]: A courgette or a marrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something as simple as language can be
either alienating or comforting,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the point of reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take this simple example of how we
call a vegetable, and then you multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: that in an entire class, an entire
program, in someone's entire life,
[SPEAKER_00]: their lived experience, where their frame
of reference is not the same frame of
[SPEAKER_00]: reference of the person that is teaching
them or that they're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes a big difference in terms of
someone's connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spend a lot of time just helping
people to get to a common language,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people to think about how
information can be relevant to their lived
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of their participants,
and to accommodating various types of
[SPEAKER_00]: learners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just learners who are going to
be reading information necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we work in this day and age,
assuming that literacy is a non-issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that any type of learner can be in the
room together and can come away with the
[SPEAKER_00]: same translatable skills?
[SPEAKER_00]: So another big piece that we've learned is
that garden education is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide all the classes under the
sun, and at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: if someone doesn't have access to a
container or to starts or to seeds or to
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, everything is done in vain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So access for us is a critical piece that
goes hand-in-hand with the education
[SPEAKER_00]: piece, and that's why we're moving more
and more towards a garden resource center
[SPEAKER_00]: model, where we provide very low-cost,
free, or subsidized resources for
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners, because this is what we hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The class was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a ton of knowledge,
but now what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get soil from my container.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that question, I think, needs to be
explored a lot more between Extension and
[SPEAKER_00]: food banks to see how garden access can be
facilitated, both at the urban scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: at the rural scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concept of social capital has come up
over and over again in our program,
[SPEAKER_00]: building relationships to create social
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social capital is one of those really
incredible outcomes of this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a program that happens over time,
and it happens through intentionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just get people in the room and
social capital emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really takes the intentional
facilitation of an instructor to create
[SPEAKER_00]: those bonds and to create an experience
where that emerges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, some of the lessons
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaluation is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been changing the program every
year, and it's because we evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it very seriously, all of our
instructors and gardeners, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate those findings into the
program curricula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I think 80% of the program is
about those other aspects I talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: around social connectivity, around
resilience, confidence, being able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it through the month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gardening is just a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only as strong as your
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like a catch-all phrase,
but partnership building is hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in communities that are very
divided, culturally divided, divided by
[SPEAKER_00]: resource competition, that idea of,
well, this is my turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that a lot with extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that a lot throughout Portland in
terms of different communities that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to own an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to transcend through that
and build partnerships across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaching is art to be cultivated over
time, and we all can continually learn to
[SPEAKER_00]: be better educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just trying to let go and see
where we will lead us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, this is a
community-based program, so really that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the essence for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, we have about four,
three minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is three and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to try to leave longer time
for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but I would love to hear any
reflections or questions you all might
[SPEAKER_00]: have around working with underserved
audiences, working in the garden education
[SPEAKER_00]: realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Seed to Suffer curriculum,
the Oregon version is downloadable from
[SPEAKER_00]: our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just search Oregon Food Bank,
you can find it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a New York State version,
which is currently only being shared out
[SPEAKER_00]: to select counties that are part of the
program here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lori would be the person to talk to
about viewing the New York version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is Seed to Suffer funded, and are your
funding sources short-term or sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about our funding
sources is our budget is about $17 million
[SPEAKER_00]: a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of that is public donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monthly donations in the realm of $20,
$200 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 80% of our revenue stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 20% comes from small grants,
corporate grants, that are just kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a very, very small part of our
revenue stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now are beginning to cost share
with Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We funded the program entirely on our own
as a food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Extension is now beginning to pitch in
and help to fund some of the local costs
[SPEAKER_00]: related to printing books and printing the
teaching kits that are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to jump off Don's question on
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who might be donating $20% or
who is coming from the program?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of our donors are not
clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the word client to mean anyone
who's food insecure receiving food or
[SPEAKER_00]: participating in our program, someone
who's under 200% of the public poverty
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people who are benefiting from the
program currently are not donating to the
[SPEAKER_00]: food bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of donors who were food
insecure and who are now donating because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were poor as a child.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
