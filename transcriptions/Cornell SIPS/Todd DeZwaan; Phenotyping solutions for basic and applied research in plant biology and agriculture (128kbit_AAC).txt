[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the great things about high
throughput plant phenotyping is,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant breeding side is,
we've been thinking about high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plant breeders themselves have been
doing phenotyping for the past 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've tried to get plants to feed and
clothe the world and provide food,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel and feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, not all plant breeders evolve
at such a slow pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quickly have realized that there is
a lot of tremendous technologies that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be applied to our field of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, in a sense, forcing us to think
more broadly into computer science,
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, robotics and artificial
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this symposium, I feel, isn't just for
plant sciences themselves, but it really
[SPEAKER_00]: is also an opportunity for us to reach out
to other departments on campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for them to see the value of our work
and how they can fit into that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our first talk today is going to be by
Todd Zewon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is from one of the best phenotyping
companies in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the title of his presentation is
Phenotyping Solutions for Basic and
[SPEAKER_00]: Applied Research in Plant Biology and
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Alina, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we started this conversation a
couple of months ago or six weeks or so
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really nice to be able to follow
it up so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speed is so important in this area of
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be talking to you about
phenotyping solutions for plant biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you can apply them to agricultural
research applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming at this from the perspective of
today being the business development lead
[SPEAKER_01]: for a technology company that's developing
solutions in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my background is, prior to that,
I spent 11 years working with Monsanto and
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically my last role with Monsanto
before I left the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And September was a strategy lead for a
precision phenotyping system that they had
[SPEAKER_01]: developed, that they constructed in
Research Triangle Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prior to that, I was working with
Paradigm Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were working on what we called the
Gene Function Factory in Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_01]: between 2000 and 2005, where we were doing
a lot of high-throughput phenotyping in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I'm pitching a product,
if that's the right thing to say today,
[SPEAKER_01]: while I'm here representing Lemna Tech,
I also have a pretty extensive background
[SPEAKER_01]: in the application side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start out a little bit just
echoing what Mike said about the history
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk a little bit about the challenges
coming primarily from the genomic side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't talk too much about the
environment, but, of course, G by E is
[SPEAKER_01]: crucial to anything that you do in the
phenotyping space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll shift from there and talk a
little bit about technologies that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: developing at Lemna Tech and how they
address some of the solutions to those
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges that we're facing as
researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to echo what Mike said,
we have been phenotyping for 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, phenotyping was one of the key
things that came out of the Neolithic
[SPEAKER_01]: Revolution as we domesticated species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a dog lover and as a connoisseur and
occasional home brewer of beer,
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation and domestication of animals
also came out of the Neolithic Revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like dog lovers, beer brewing,
and phenotyping should all coincide as an
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for what Neolithic man gave
us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really impressive when we look at
the history of phenotyping over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 9,000 years when you consider what
teosinte is and what it has become with
[SPEAKER_01]: field corn today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's even more impressive is that
idea of speed and how that has accelerated
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last 50 to 75 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at breeding gains in corn
for 10,000 years, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at where we were back around
1920 before the advent of hybridization in
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, it took a land area about the
equivalent of a half-court of a basketball
[SPEAKER_01]: court to produce one bushel of corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through hybridization and impressive gains
in yield through breeding and then with
[SPEAKER_01]: the advent of biotechnology in the late
90s, which really has done a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect those breeding gains on corn
acreage, today we are at about a land area
[SPEAKER_01]: equivalent for a bushel of corn that is
equivalent to the space within the free
[SPEAKER_01]: throw lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the free throw line and the out
of bounds, that's about how much land area
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes to produce a bushel of corn
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about that reduction in space and
what that's the positive impact that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really had on productivity and
ability to use land as we feed a growing
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're projected to produce an
equivalent bushel on even less acreage as
[SPEAKER_01]: we move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mendel is considered the father of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's also foundational in
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can really trace our ideas of
phenotyping and features that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: characterizing in plant growth and
development back to those observational
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that Mendel had with peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that he was looking at
genetically, he was describing as a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenotype is really critical for
explaining genetic outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter how we modify the genome,
the desired outcome always occurs at the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of the phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you're looking at traditional
breeding outcomes like Mendel was doing or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're looking at non-Mendelian
inheritance through epigenetics or other
[SPEAKER_01]: types of modification through protoplast
fusion or mutagenesis, transgenesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: polyploidy, and just recently there have
been a number of products that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: released on the market that are the first
generation products of gene editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Browning resistant mushrooms is one
example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter how we modify the genome,
we always want to see what's happening at
[SPEAKER_01]: the level of the phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ability to modify the genome,
the precision with which we can modify the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenome, the cost of modifying the genome
with the genome, these are all becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: more and more, these are all making genome
modification more and more accessible to
[SPEAKER_01]: not only industry, but also plant biology
researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the scale of genome modification is
increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just reflecting some graphs
that I'm sure all of you have seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: that all of you have seen over the recent
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cost of sequencing actually is
moving faster than the decreasing cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: computational power by Moore's law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where $3 billion was spent to sequence
the human genome in the late 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can now do it for about 1,000,
which is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as genome sequencing costs go down,
of course, the amount of sequencing data
[SPEAKER_01]: that we accumulate increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up to the hundreds of trillions
of base pairs in GenBank today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, as the cost of sequencing
goes down, adjacent technologies like gene
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis are also coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of this is pointing to our ability
to accelerate genome modification and the
[SPEAKER_01]: real demand to meet that acceleration in
genome modification with corresponding
[SPEAKER_01]: increase and advancements in phenomics
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put this slide together sort of to
editorialize some ideas that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about over the past six months
since I've been with Lemnetech and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking to customers and I've been
talking to people in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Western Europe about sort of the state
of work where academia and industry are
[SPEAKER_01]: with phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to do sort of a manual spot
fiery type view of my thinking on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to first talk about the size of
these bubbles that I'm showing on this
[SPEAKER_01]: slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the size is, what I've done is really
kind of taken size to represent utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I hear a lot
when I talk to people about phenotyping is
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of interest that, you know,
almost one of the first things that come
[SPEAKER_01]: up are interest areas in these smaller
bubbles, the NIR, infrared, chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescence, fluorescence in general as a
phenotyping technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I will say is in my experience
and what real world needs really is,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 80 to 85 percent of the questions
that you ask will rely on high resolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable, repeatable, visible light
imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always going to be the cornerstone
of your phenotyping inquiry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some really impressive
advances in technology and capabilities in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or two, 3D laser scanning is another
really useful tool for phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses a laser based approach to give you
a very detailed three dimensional
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstruction of the plants that you're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may repeat it again later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the really powerful things that
3D laser scanning brings to phenotyping is
[SPEAKER_01]: its ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring information forward from some of
these other systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at Lemnetech we use a data analytical
approach called sensor fusion where we
[SPEAKER_01]: take the 3D image of a 3D laser scan and
overlay it on the 2D images that are
[SPEAKER_01]: produced through, for example,
a chlorophyll fluorescence system or an
[SPEAKER_01]: NIR system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it corrects for many
of the angle effects and confusion,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly, in the data that you get from a
strictly 2D image alone from some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: other modalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 3D laser scanning has very high
utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally hyperspectral is just,
there's a lot of really exciting things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening with hyperspectral imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from field scanning using hyperspectral
to do scouting early detection of disease
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as taking it into the laboratory
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a group out of the University
of Bond who's using hyperspectral imaging
[SPEAKER_01]: to study metabolic and other chemical
compositional changes in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of real discovery phase
things that are happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperspectral imaging these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the size of the bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you're thinking about cost,
and this is all very subjective,
[SPEAKER_01]: so working in tens of thousands,
working in orders of magnitude,
[SPEAKER_01]: not specific numbers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of cost, visible light
phenotyping is by far going to be sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: your entry level solution for coming in in
the five to $20,000 range for very nice
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then laser scanning, you start getting up
into the $10,000 to $70,000 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very easy to spend over $100,000
on hyperspectral, on high-end
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperspectral cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some things to keep in mind as
you're thinking about developing
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotyping solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think more than anything, think about
the kinds of questions that you're asking
[SPEAKER_01]: now and think about the growth potential
of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how you can build on it as your needs
change going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to take this and take some of
these ideas and talk about, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: just given the time, I'll probably talk a
little bit about visible light imaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we're using it, and some of the tools
we've developed at LemonTech, show you how
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using laser scanning, and then talk
about a new instrument that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: developed for hyperspectral imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see where we are and jump
to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, visible light imaging is
really the cornerstone of any phenotyping
[SPEAKER_01]: system that you put in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Visible light imaging is going to deliver
the information that you need for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: size, plant architecture, color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a very high-quality system,
you can get a very high degree of temporal
[SPEAKER_01]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start looking at change over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use analytical solutions
that I think Chris will talk to you more
[SPEAKER_01]: about to do things like looking at
skeletonization to define leaf number,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf length, angles, stem length,
elongation rates, change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use color to quantify very
specific features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get an early view of damage
either due to herbicide or disease or
injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or abiotic stress, whatever your question
is, using color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can correlate some of those color
changes with specific responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, you get a very different
color response in Arabidopsis under
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen stress than you do drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can extend it further beyond plants to
insect feeding assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that a number of our
industrial partners use our systems for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use it for insect feeding assays on
dietary plates or even leaf discs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, you can use visible
light imaging to get a lot of information
[SPEAKER_01]: around post-harvest questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at things like ear metrics,
tip void, doing an estimate of total
[SPEAKER_01]: kernel count, individual seed metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get information about color and
some compositional features based on how
[SPEAKER_01]: color changes over the dimensions of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially all of our systems,
whether it's a laboratory field or a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse system, are all going to have
visible light imaging as the foundation of
[SPEAKER_01]: the instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just showing three examples of some of
our instruments here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left here, this is a manual
individual plant phenotyping system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you can also do flats in the top
down version of this instrument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's essentially used, it's an entry
level system that's used for low
[SPEAKER_01]: throughput phenotyping of individual flats
or plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a standalone system with touch screen
control that also allows you to do on the
[SPEAKER_01]: fly data vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's available, as I'm showing here,
for top down view.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a short wide one that you
can use for side view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at taller plants,
and especially for monocots, often you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have that side view imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up here at the top is a new system that
we're developing this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of, I think of it as sort
of a, as an entry level automated
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotyping solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy the base unit that you see
here with only visible light imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can start immediately doing high
throughput phenotyping of flats of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: or microtiter plates or whatever your
research area calls for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can then, it's modular in that in
the sense that you can start adding on a
[SPEAKER_01]: tray feeder if your throughput increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also add on other imaging units if
your imaging demands increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can start expanding beyond
visible light into things like chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescence or hyperspectral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally down here is just a
picture of a conveyor system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, visible light is part of all of
those systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these systems are larger greenhouse
installations that have fully integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and plant growth and maintenance
and watering and so forth in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3D laser scanning, the way this works is
you use a laser to generate a point cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those point clouds identify very
specific features.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do this at a high degree of
resolution and use machine learning type
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches to take those features that
you're extracting via the point clouds and
[SPEAKER_01]: start using machine learning to identify
specific organ level features,
[SPEAKER_01]: panicles, leaves, things like that on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, so I just want to give you an
example of how we're using 3D laser
[SPEAKER_01]: scanning in our field scan analyzer
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a system that is at the
University of Arizona Maricopa field site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the Terra reference
project and a major focus of this project
[SPEAKER_01]: is accelerating breeding in bioenergy
sorghum to produce bioenergy sorghum as a
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity crop for the southeastern region
of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have many sensors within the sensor
box that we use at the Maricopa site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser scanners are an important part of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said before, what the laser
scanners allow us to do is that sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: fusion approach by coupling the 3D view
that we generate from laser scanning with
[SPEAKER_01]: the 2D views of infrared, PS2,
and hyperspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I just want to show here is a view
of what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is data that was actually captured
over time from the Maricopa field site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of things that I want
to point out with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we're getting to the point
with laser scanning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 3D imaging with laser scanning that
from a gantry system, we can singulate
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were able to monitor the growth of
these sets of plants individually over
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing that you can see is
the 3D images give you a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can start seeing very distinct
architectural differences between these
[SPEAKER_01]: two plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just focus on an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that there's very different
panicle density between the one on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left and the one on the right so that you
can start identifying very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: features.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're working on is
to try to get laser scanning below,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get further down into the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while those are two of the strengths,
one of the drawbacks is with 3D laser
[SPEAKER_01]: scanning from a gantry, you really get
only the top half to third of the plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: that 3D view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't spend too much time talking
about specific indices with hyperspectral
[SPEAKER_01]: imaging, except to say that there are a
wide variety of indices that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: developed using hyperspectral imaging,
everything from NDVI for remote imaging of
[SPEAKER_01]: fields and forests to specific indices
that measure things like water,
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll, and stress pigment
composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of discovery potential
with hyperspect, and I think that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot, there's going to be a lot more,
a lot more knowledge to be gained using
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperspect in the years ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've recently developed a robotic unit
that will allow us to use hyperspectral
[SPEAKER_01]: combined with the 3D laser to get,
to translate very complex plant structural
[SPEAKER_01]: level information into a very high
resolution 3D model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a robot, it's got an
articulating arm that's got hyperspectral,
[SPEAKER_01]: 3D laser scanner, and then two lights that
focus into a line, and you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all of your imaging in a line across
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the microphone here is the plant,
you can very easily scan up with the robot
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the articulating arm comes down
and it generates a very high resolution in
[SPEAKER_01]: three dimensions that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I'm going to jump through
these next couple of slides, because there
[SPEAKER_01]: was one point that I thought was worth
talking about with this audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm coming up on time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lemnetech produces, when we're looking
at greenhouse, when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse level solutions for
phenotyping, Lemnetech really delivers
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse phenotyping solutions based on,
that are tailored to a research
[SPEAKER_01]: institution's demands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the Nebraska Innovation Campus,
we have a conveyor-based greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: system, and we recently completed at the
Cranfield Agricultural Engineering
[SPEAKER_01]: Precision Innovation Center, a
gantry-based system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of pros and cons to
either of these systems that I think are
[SPEAKER_01]: worth evaluating as you're thinking about
building out infrastructure in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So conveyor-based systems have been around
for quite a number of years, and in many
[SPEAKER_01]: respects, they're a very tried and true
way of doing high-throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the drawbacks of a conveyor
system are that you have lower size and
[SPEAKER_01]: weight limits because of the intrinsic
limits of the conveyor, and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: intrinsic limits of the cabinets that
you're bringing the plants through.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, a gantry system, because the
plants don't have to move, you're bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: the sensor to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a gantry system, you can basically
phenotype large plants all the way out to
[SPEAKER_01]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're asking questions of corn out
to V7, then maybe a conveyor, then maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: conveyor system is what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really want to start asking
reproductive stage questions around corn
[SPEAKER_01]: in a controlled environment, a gantry
system is probably the solution that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conveyor systems, as I said when we were
talking about 3D imaging with the gantry,
[SPEAKER_01]: conveyor systems will give you
high-resolution whole plant imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gantry system will be relying on 3D
imaging and 3D reconstructions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you're getting down to about
halfway down the plant, but you won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get all the way down to the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some solutions that you
could consider with sort of imaging within
[SPEAKER_01]: the rows of a gantry system to supplement
your gantry, but from the gantry itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to be able to get the
entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with a conveyor system,
while you're doing plant-level tracking
[SPEAKER_01]: and analysis, which can be very important,
for basic research, the gantry system will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to do canopy-level analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're asking for how things
translate more into a field context,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gantry system may be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conveyor system, as I'm trying to
communicate down here with this graph,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a fixed configuration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is some variation in how you can
populate the greenhouse with a conveyor
[SPEAKER_01]: system, but in general, your pots are
always going to be this far apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could populate it with every other
pot, or you can change your pot so that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's multiple plants within a carrier,
but they're always going to be in this
[SPEAKER_01]: configuration that's defined by the
conveyor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A gantry system, it's wide open,
so you can configure the floor of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse however you want with a gantry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with the conveyor system,
the movement really mitigates any
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental variation that will occur in
any greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter how good your greenhouse is,
there's always going to be environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: variation, and you'll need to take that
into consideration with your experimental
[SPEAKER_01]: design with a gantry system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one real quick point.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cases where moving your plant can
influence the outcome of the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously a gantry system is going to be a
better choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a real clear example of that is thermal
imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do anything with thermal
imaging, as soon as you move the plant on
[SPEAKER_01]: a conveyor, you immediately disrupt your
ability to do that in a biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get data, but whether it's
interpretable or meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we provide all of the software for all
of the instrumentation that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: described, and I also want to give a shout
out here to the PlantCV software,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really it's an open source software
solution that overlaps a lot with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that we do with LemnaGrid,
and there's a lot of really exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: things happening with PlantCV these days
in the plant community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll jump to the end here and just
open it up to some final questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to summarize, phenotyping really
follows on genotyping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crucial that we develop tools to
address this challenge as we become more
[SPEAKER_01]: capable in our ability to genotype and
make genome modifications, and LemnaTech
[SPEAKER_01]: delivers solutions at a variety of scales,
laboratory, greenhouse, and fields to do
[SPEAKER_01]: just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'll finish up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: the robot moves around the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not a need for the plant to
rotate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the cabinets that I showed on the
conveyor system, actually if you looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular image, as the plant moves
into those cabinets, it moves onto a stage
[SPEAKER_01]: that lifts it, and that rotates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then from fixed cameras, you can get a
variety of different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the robot, there will be,
this is the plant, this is the robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the robot, there will be one camera
that moves around like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cabinets, there's two cameras,
maybe three, but the plant moves in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cabinet configuration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a higher throughput,
so that kind of solution in the cabinet
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have, that's a higher
throughput, lower resolution solution to
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The robot is specifically a solution we're
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lower throughput, but higher
resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the time per plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll depend on the question you're
asking, but you can easily test a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse if you take a conveyor
greenhouse, you can easily test a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse of 500 or even 1,000 or 2,000
plants in a day through visible light
[SPEAKER_01]: imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the robotic unit, that's gonna be
like five to 10, that can be up,
[SPEAKER_01]: hyperspect slows everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter whether it's on a robot or it's
fixed mounted, hyperspect slows everything
[SPEAKER_01]: down, because you're looking at multiple
wave, you're capturing multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be, that is probably gonna be
five to 10 minutes per plant, depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the type of scan that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you can do, you can get high
throughput, you can test an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question, that's a really great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the data analytics, the data analytics
piece, developing the computational tools
[SPEAKER_01]: for handling the massive amounts of
information that we're generating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gantry system, Chris might
actually be able to answer better,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's generating terabytes of data per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just an enormous,
so the data analytics, the data analytics
[SPEAKER_01]: piece, there's really important to be able
to take the biological know-how and bridge
[SPEAKER_01]: it with the instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really crucial piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding what the strengths,
weaknesses, limits are of the sensor
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation that's out there is really
crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll think about that some more,
and be ready to talk to grad students at
[SPEAKER_01]: the break.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University, on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
