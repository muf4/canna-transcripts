[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you heard cyber security and
you're like, this is very different,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do two very disparate things.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have questions about cyber security
or blockchains, that's sort of 90% of my
[SPEAKER_07]: real job at Stanford, and I'm happy to
answer those as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is kind of the 10% of my time
where I wanted to get back into protein
[SPEAKER_07]: engineering, and so I started to work with
GFI.
[SPEAKER_07]: GFI is kind of a think tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a completely remote organization,
and so we don't have lab space of our own,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we support researchers at universities
across the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We fund some research, and we work with
companies that are developing both
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat, which is what I'll talk
to you about today, and clean meat or kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of cell-cultured meat will be part of the
future of replacing some of our current
[SPEAKER_07]: animal agriculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of our reasons for doing this in
the first place is that we project that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to need to feed 10 billion
people by about 2050, and the way that we
[SPEAKER_07]: currently use the Earth's surface now in
terms of how much land is devoted to
[SPEAKER_07]: habitable land, how much ocean,
how much glaciers, how much forest,
[SPEAKER_07]: how much is used for agriculture,
how much is used for livestock,
[SPEAKER_07]: we think is not going to be a sustainable
way of feeding this many people by 20.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that particularly the amount of
crop land and the amount of grazing land
[SPEAKER_07]: that goes toward livestock is a relatively
inefficient use of those resources.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can kind of argue over whether
these population projections are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be accurate, and when I was giving a talk
at the National Academies, Stephen Chu,
[SPEAKER_07]: who was the former Secretary of Energy,
was like, no, no, I think that humans have
[SPEAKER_07]: an internal kind of like quorum sensing
mechanism and that we're going to see
[SPEAKER_07]: populations start to decline because we
think that people are going to kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: look around and realize that we're not
using our resources efficiently and like
[SPEAKER_07]: control populations.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that we're seeing that
happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to argue, it's hard to like kind
of tell people that things are going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: okay as long as we just all decide to
start having fewer children, because I've
[SPEAKER_07]: tried to make that argument, including at
the National Academies, and people are
[SPEAKER_07]: like, haha, it's too late, we're already
in our mid-30s and 40s, we have them
[SPEAKER_07]: already.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think what we need to do is we need
to change the way that we're eating and
[SPEAKER_07]: the way that we're feeding those people
because we kind of need to assume that we
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to have more people in the world
who we are going to feed and that this is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be an inefficient system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why is it an inefficient system and
from what kind of perspective do we think
[SPEAKER_07]: of it as being inefficient?
[SPEAKER_07]: If we just look at it kind of
thermodynamically, inputs to outputs,
[SPEAKER_07]: how many calories of feed need to go into
making an animal and then how many
[SPEAKER_07]: calories of food can we get out of that
animal, we see that the majority of the
[SPEAKER_07]: livestock that we actually all the
livestock that we use are inefficient and
[SPEAKER_07]: in fact, some of the primary, more
efficient species, we're not even talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about cows, which we know are inefficient,
large animals, smaller animals that we
[SPEAKER_07]: grow like pigs and chickens and fish,
are also very inefficient in the sense
[SPEAKER_07]: that the amount of calories in that are
converted to calories out is somewhere
[SPEAKER_07]: around 10 to 12%.
[SPEAKER_07]: For cattle, it's even lower.
[SPEAKER_07]: For cattle, it's below 10, it's about 8%.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some species of farmed fish that
can get you up to like 20 or 22%,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the way that they calculate that,
kind of like the life cycle analysis of
[SPEAKER_07]: the farmed fish, in often cases,
in many cases, doesn't take into account
[SPEAKER_07]: the nutrients that it's getting from the
kind of surrounding ocean that the farm is
[SPEAKER_07]: in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of like farmed salmon they'll do
off the coast of like Nova Scotia,
[SPEAKER_07]: off the coast of Maine, they'll be in
these pens that are semi-permeable,
[SPEAKER_07]: they are able to get some nutrients from
the surrounding ocean water and that's not
[SPEAKER_07]: taking into account in the LCA,
so that kind of sums up the efficiency
[SPEAKER_07]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, they're running out of
coastline to make farmed salmon,
[SPEAKER_07]: so the latest thing is that they have
bought, companies that are farming salmon
[SPEAKER_07]: have bought plots of land in like central
Florida, and so they're making just these
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly large pens on land filled with
water, kept very cold, because salmon like
[SPEAKER_07]: a very cold environment, even though
they're in Florida, they're these kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like refrigerated, cooled tanks,
that they're growing farmed salmon in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to talk about inefficiency
and about the effects on the environment,
[SPEAKER_07]: not only do we sometimes see that in
farmed fish, we get disease spread from
[SPEAKER_07]: the pens into the ocean, because they're
these semi-permeable pens, if we're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to try to grow fish that require cold
water on land, then we're really getting
[SPEAKER_07]: into lower efficiencies than we think
would be optimal for being able to feed as
[SPEAKER_07]: many people as we're going to need to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can also talk about in terms of then
food waste, we know that food waste is a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem in terms of recapturing the
nutrients that we're able to grow and
[SPEAKER_07]: produce, and the amount of food wasted by
consumers or in the supply chain is
[SPEAKER_07]: dwarfed in comparison to the amount of
food wasted in producing chicken or beef
[SPEAKER_07]: as two of the most common animal protein
sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another way of looking at that is that we
devote quite a lot of our land mammal
[SPEAKER_07]: population to our pets and livestock,
as opposed to wild animals, we also see
[SPEAKER_07]: some habitat loss kind of off-target
effects of growing this many sheep,
[SPEAKER_07]: goats, pigs, horses, and cattle,
where we're using a lot of land that could
[SPEAKER_07]: be either used for crops or could be
preserved for natural environments,
[SPEAKER_07]: using it to grow livestock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we think that that's a problem,
then why do we see that global demand for
[SPEAKER_07]: meat is increasing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Across all categories of meat,
based on both US and global demand,
[SPEAKER_07]: we see that we have increased demand for
meat due now in 2050, as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: particularly increased demand in fast
growing in populations and developing
[SPEAKER_07]: economy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the reason for that is that as
people get richer, they want to model
[SPEAKER_07]: their diets more on traditionally Western
diets, they want to eat more meat,
[SPEAKER_07]: where meat is feed is a status symbol,
and so that's why we see some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: highest growth rates in terms of meat
consumption in faster growing amounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're projected to eat a lot more meat
by 2050, and particularly a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: chicken, and that meat is going to have to
come from somewhere, but hopefully it
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't have to come from the same system
that's being used to produce it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I want to point out is that
we don't actually have a protein deficit.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're eating much more protein than we
need, particularly in wealthy regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some reason, we're not all buff and
muscle-bound, so some of this protein is
[SPEAKER_07]: just kind of going to waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you look at the average daily
protein requirement across different
[SPEAKER_07]: countries and how we're meeting that
requirement, in many places around the
[SPEAKER_07]: world, we would be able to meet all of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Protein requirement just with plant
protein alone, not need to take into
[SPEAKER_07]: account all the excess animal protein that
we consume.
[SPEAKER_07]: So taking that into account, we want to
look at the idea of whether we can replace
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the animal-based protein that
people are using with plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are plant-based proteins?
[SPEAKER_07]: This audience probably knows what those
end up becoming.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are some of the plant-based meat
products and plant-based dairy products
[SPEAKER_07]: that are currently available.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's anything from replacing chicken and
beef in the sandwich to replacing cheeses,
[SPEAKER_07]: other types of plant-based dairy products,
even additives into combined products
[SPEAKER_07]: where you'll have some animal meat and
some plant-based meat that are combined
[SPEAKER_07]: into what's called a plant product.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want, again, to look back at plant
proteins as replacing animal proteins
[SPEAKER_07]: because they're more sustainable,
and they're more sustainable in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: land use, in terms of water consumption,
in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beef is the least efficient animal meat in
terms of land use, but all animal meats to
[SPEAKER_07]: the right of the dashed line perform
worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of all of these categories than
plant-based foods do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we want to transition some of our
protein consumption to more sustainable
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins, it kind of behooves us to look
into plant proteins rather than trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: optimize maybe the efficiency of farm pork
or farm fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a long history of plant-based
meat, but the history of kind of the
[SPEAKER_07]: directed engineering of plant-based
products really happens in the last 15 or
[SPEAKER_07]: so years with the Beyond Burger and the
Impossible Burger, which I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: in some of the newer products.
[SPEAKER_07]: These companies are developing,
but plant-based meat, we can kind of trace
[SPEAKER_07]: back to some of the earliest known meat
substitutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things like tofu and yuba and tempeh are
kind of in a category themselves in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sense that when we do market analyses or
we look at like meals and scores of
[SPEAKER_07]: supermarket sales in terms of a
plant-based meat category, they don't lump
[SPEAKER_07]: tofu or tempeh or yuba into that category.
[SPEAKER_07]: They think of them as a separate kind of a
separate product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're talking about plant-based
meat sales, we're talking only about
[SPEAKER_07]: products that are like veggie burgers or
veggie sausage that are specifically
[SPEAKER_07]: designed to replace a particular meat
component and not something like tofu,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we see historically that tofu and like
wheat, gluten, tempeh were used to replace
[SPEAKER_07]: meat products as far back as 925 AD,
1815 for tempeh in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the then nut and peanut-based meat
substitutes that were developed as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: tofu, soy-based meat substitutes were
aimed at a religious audience,
[SPEAKER_07]: an audience that didn't want to eat meat
either one day a week or for other
[SPEAKER_07]: religious holidays.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these started to be commercialized by
John Kellogg and others at kind of the
[SPEAKER_07]: start of the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: meatless burger, the soy burger,
is from 1937.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see then the advent of textile
manufacturing tools to produce textured
[SPEAKER_07]: and spun soy protein fibers, the idea that
now we can take plant proteins and make
[SPEAKER_07]: them into textures that look a bit more
like muscle fibers and that replicate
[SPEAKER_07]: better the texture of the piece of meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we start to see more
commercialization Morningstar Farms,
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of the Boca burgers that you might
have been familiar with in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: The FDA released in 1999 the statement
that consumption of soy protein may reduce
[SPEAKER_07]: the risk of heart disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of improved marketing and
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods
were both founded in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_07]: both by chemists named Brown, so they are
frequently confused, but two separate
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make the Beyond Burger and the
Impossible Burger, which they launched
[SPEAKER_07]: within about a year of each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also pretty confused, but we'll go
into the differences between them and kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of some of the strategy behind making
these kind of more engineered plant
[SPEAKER_07]: protein burgers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of what GFI wants to do is
support companies to enter into this space
[SPEAKER_07]: and also to support research in the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we put out a call for proposals
for plant-based researchers worldwide
[SPEAKER_07]: doing research on either texturing of
plant proteins, extracting plant proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: growing plants that have higher
concentrations of proteins, the way that
[SPEAKER_07]: we categorize it is in terms of this mind
map, where we look at what goes into
[SPEAKER_07]: making plant-based meat, everything from
sourcing protein, isolation and
[SPEAKER_07]: functionalization, formulation,
processing, and then distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look for research that's going on
in all of these areas because we think
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're going to need to have process
improvements across all pieces of this
[SPEAKER_07]: mind map in order to get to products that
meet consumer demand in terms of taste,
[SPEAKER_07]: price, and convenience, and are able to
replace some of the animal-based meat
[SPEAKER_07]: market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting with ingredient sourcing,
to make plant-based meat, we have to have
[SPEAKER_07]: plants provide all of the raw materials,
so not just the protein, but to provide
[SPEAKER_07]: the carbohydrates, the fat, the
flavorings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk a little bit later about why
it's particularly difficult to incorporate
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based fats into these products when
comparing it to something like the fat
[SPEAKER_07]: that's naturally present in beef or pork.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this can involve things like crop
engineering and breeding, genomic trait
[SPEAKER_07]: mapping to see which parts of the plant
genome correspond to higher protein yields
[SPEAKER_07]: or higher bioavailability of protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also involves looking at different
sources of protein from things like algae,
[SPEAKER_07]: even from non-plant sources like fungi
that we usually kind of just lump in with
[SPEAKER_07]: plant proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we look at what proteins from plants
are used in plant-based meat right now,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's still predominantly soy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soy pea and wheat are kind of the three
main plant proteins that are used in
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat products, and soy overall
is the most popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of that is because soy is a complete
protein, so when you look at analyzing a
[SPEAKER_07]: plant protein, you look at the PD-CAS
score, and that looks at the
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrations of different amino acids in
that protein, and you want something
[SPEAKER_07]: that's close to one as possible so that it
has all the nutritional requirements of
[SPEAKER_07]: the amino acids that we cannot provide
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soy meets that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soy is around .9 to one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can reach a PD-CAS score of one by
combining other plant proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that kind of nutritional completeness
of soy protein is one of the main reasons
[SPEAKER_07]: why soy is predominantly used.
[SPEAKER_07]: But part of it is also because plant
proteins for a long time were used or
[SPEAKER_07]: thought of as kind of something like a
secondary use of these crops, and so we
[SPEAKER_07]: have a lot of field space devoted to soy,
devoted to wheat, devoted to corn,
[SPEAKER_07]: to feed crops, or I mean to feed livestock
and to grow as other crop sources,
[SPEAKER_07]: and so that was part of the reason also
for why we used these proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: even if they may not be the ones that most
closely mimic animal proteins in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: the extractive form and the functionalized
form.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the studies that we're looking at
are how nutrition profiles vary across
[SPEAKER_07]: different grains where we might be able to
extract not only the protein but also the
[SPEAKER_07]: fiber and the fat from those grains to
make more ingredients available for
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look at the macronutrient
content in cereal grains, we see a variety
[SPEAKER_07]: of protein concentrations, but then also a
broader range of variety in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: fiber, fat, or oil that's available for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then similarly, the micronutrient
content, even among millets, where there's
[SPEAKER_07]: a project that we work with at Berkeley
that's trying to increase the cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: of millets, and study both the
availability of protein in millets and
[SPEAKER_07]: also the nutrient content of millet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Millet is a lot more commonly grown in
Europe, not as much in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason for that that they find is that
when they try to encourage farmers to
[SPEAKER_07]: switch over to millet, because there's not
a strong millet market in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_07]: they have trouble getting crop insurance
for it, and then because they can't get
[SPEAKER_07]: crop insurance for it, they don't grow it,
so it's kind of this catch-22 cycle of
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to get people to switch over on a
large scale to a new cereal crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the benefits then of trying to
extract protein from this crop is that you
[SPEAKER_07]: can also get the subsidiary benefit of
having better micronutrient contents from
[SPEAKER_07]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you want a product that has a
high iron concentration, because you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that iron leads to kind of like a meaty
taste, it leads to more of like a bloody
[SPEAKER_07]: taste, you may want to have a crop that
has higher levels of iron to begin with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another way that we're trying to study the
variability in plant proteins is through
[SPEAKER_07]: how environmental conditions impact crop
performance.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if we're growing the same crop,
we know that pH levels and nitrogen levels
[SPEAKER_07]: can vary quite a bit in soil, and then we
may need to look at, for example,
[SPEAKER_07]: for pea varieties, how growing pea
varieties in these different soil
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrations affects the protein
content, which is something that's usually
[SPEAKER_07]: not part of a general yield study.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're trying to do in supporting
this research is to optimize these crops
[SPEAKER_07]: to improve the raw materials.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to improve the nutrition and the
functionality and the performance of the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants that we're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to improve the bioavailability of
the protein that we're extracting.
[SPEAKER_07]: We probably want to improve the
concentration of the protein in that
[SPEAKER_07]: plant, and we also want to do that in a
way that decreases cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So of the projects that we support at
these various universities, one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: ones that's focused specifically on that
is this one at Clemson University that's
[SPEAKER_07]: characterizing field pea and sorghum crops
to try and improve the protein content of
[SPEAKER_07]: them and improve the nutrition for
plant-based meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of one of the first studies
where they're specifically selecting and
[SPEAKER_07]: optimizing cultivars for protein
extraction for plant-based meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for protein biofortification.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another one is looking at quinoa as a raw
material for plant-based meat products,
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to characterize and optimize
existing quinoa varieties and optimize
[SPEAKER_07]: protein extraction methods that you can
prototype for quinoa protein products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So quinoa is cultivated around the globe,
and it's considered to be pretty resistant
[SPEAKER_07]: to abiotic and abiotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_07]: The average grain yield for quinoa is two
and a half to three and a half tons per
[SPEAKER_07]: hectare.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the last 10 years,
this group has conducted experiments to
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivate quinoa in Israel, and they've
increased that to an average grain yield
[SPEAKER_07]: of six tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're thinking that quinoa might be a
more sustainable crop in Israel than in
[SPEAKER_07]: other areas where it's grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be highly commercially valuable
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to try to evaluate quinoa as
a sustainable source of protein itself,
[SPEAKER_07]: taking seeds from high-yielding quinoa
accessions and characterizing them for
[SPEAKER_07]: protein content, fat content, fiber
content, looking at different extraction
[SPEAKER_07]: methods to prepare the protein
concentrates and protein isolates,
[SPEAKER_07]: fiber, and defatted quinoa flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of the projects in Israel.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another company that we work with
that's an Israeli company, Equinom.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do crop breeding and strain
development to improve multiple traits
[SPEAKER_07]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were founded six years ago to have a
breeding and seed development company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they're trying to look at is ways
of increasing protein concentration in
[SPEAKER_07]: these plants, as well as other things like
color and taste and amino acid composition
[SPEAKER_07]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've done that with yellow pea in
about three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: They increased the amount of protein in
the yellow pea strain they're working with
[SPEAKER_07]: from 16% to 20% to about 20% to 30% in the
seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have projects with cow pea,
fava bean, mung bean, lentil, quinoa,
[SPEAKER_07]: with the university they're funding in
Israel, chickpea and sesame.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll collect as many cultivars and
variants, varieties, as they can,
[SPEAKER_07]: genotype and phenotype them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Algorithm really just simulate all the
potential crosses that they could do with
[SPEAKER_07]: these varieties, make those crosses,
and then with two to three cycles per
[SPEAKER_07]: year, look at which end up having,
in this case, higher protein
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrations or better taste,
better amino acid composition,
[SPEAKER_07]: and iteratively narrow in on which are
going to be the best process for,
[SPEAKER_07]: in this case, for protein composition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not particularly directed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to make this entire field a
matrix of all the potential crosses that
[SPEAKER_07]: they can make with all the varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the reason for that is that some
of the crops that they're working with are
[SPEAKER_07]: poorly characterized in terms of what
improves protein concentration,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're also trying to do this in a
relatively short time frame.
[SPEAKER_07]: So based on the success with yellow pea,
we're working on them to try to increase
[SPEAKER_07]: protein concentrations in some of these
other varieties with the hope that if we
[SPEAKER_07]: can get the protein concentration in some
of these varieties up to the same level as
[SPEAKER_07]: we see protein in soybean, for example,
or in rice and wheat, then we can start to
[SPEAKER_07]: transition some of the uses of soy over to
some of these other crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are some of the protein sources
that we look at both in terms of PD-CAS
[SPEAKER_07]: score, in terms of functionality.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, do they extrude well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they something that has good
whippability, that can make good
[SPEAKER_07]: emulsifications?
[SPEAKER_07]: So starting with soy as the benchmark
PD-CAS level, pea has a similar PD-CAS
[SPEAKER_07]: level and is pretty good in extrusion,
usually low allergenicity, sometimes
[SPEAKER_07]: non-GM, which can be important for
entering European markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Protein from canola from rapeseed is
actually very good, but it has limited
[SPEAKER_07]: availability in terms of getting protein
isolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other pulses have lower PD-CAS scores,
but can be in some cases combined to reach
[SPEAKER_07]: the point of soy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking into hemp protein as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunflower protein powders that can reach
up to 50% protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Corn and oats that are usually of lower
nutritional quality, lower protein
[SPEAKER_07]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one that I like because they have
chosen the name for Oatene, which is very
[SPEAKER_07]: clever of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a 54% oat protein concentration
that's mostly used in breakfast or
[SPEAKER_04]: nutritional shake.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking into other sources of
protein with the idea that we've only
[SPEAKER_07]: looked at maybe 8% of the total available
crops that could be used for plant
[SPEAKER_07]: protein, and so we don't know for certain
that those 8% that we've looked at and
[SPEAKER_07]: characterized are going to be the best in
terms of mimicking either the nutritional
[SPEAKER_07]: functions of animal protein or the
structure and formulations of animal
[SPEAKER_07]: protein products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the other kind of underutilized
or neglected crops that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_07]: as sources of plant-based protein just
based on the protein content of the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Winged bean protein has about 35% protein
in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lentils about 25% protein by mass,
and they also have very good gelling and
[SPEAKER_07]: emulsification properties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry broad bean, 25% protein, good
whiffability, good foam stability.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry cowpea, these have up to 25% protein,
and these form good emulsions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lupins have high protein content as well,
and they have favorable properties
[SPEAKER_07]: compared to soy beans.
[SPEAKER_07]: They may be able to replace some of the
soy protein in products that we're using
[SPEAKER_07]: with lupin protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some others that have been characterized
less well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bambara beans have a relatively high
protein content.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dulce, which is this kind of red seaweed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk about a project that
studies red algae that can have between
[SPEAKER_07]: nine and 25% protein by dry weight,
but is one of the main aquaculture sources
[SPEAKER_07]: of plant protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mesquite beans and then duckweed,
which is traditionally consumed as a high
[SPEAKER_07]: protein food source and has a higher
protein content than soy beans,
[SPEAKER_07]: but doesn't have very good
characterization of its functional
[SPEAKER_07]: properties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to fund research into
extracting protein from duckweed and
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at functionalization of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the projects that we're funding in
the US with this company called Trophic is
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at deriving protein from red
seaweed from macroalgae.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the supply chain for red seaweed right
now, there's about 18 million tons
[SPEAKER_07]: produced and has up to 45% protein in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we think that would be a good candidate
for plant protein products as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: because it has this kind of umami-like
flavor profile and because it's red.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people expect sometimes, expect like
beef or other kind of meat products to
[SPEAKER_07]: have that coloring.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so being able to have that in the
plant itself as a secondary extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: The key challenge here is developing an
extraction process for extracting the
[SPEAKER_07]: protein from adults that meets cost and
quality targets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this group is trying to optimize their
protein extraction processes to meet the
[SPEAKER_07]: quality specifications of some of the
secondary companies that want to make
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based protein products out of these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also look at other types of non-animal
cell cultures.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't talk about these here,
but we're also looking at using bacterial
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins or mycoproteins sometimes in
conjunction with plant-based proteins as
[SPEAKER_07]: natural sources, both of protein itself
and of flavorings, stabilizers,
[SPEAKER_07]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So most of the projects that we're funding
in this area have the aim of improving the
[SPEAKER_07]: nutritional profile of crops and
plant-based meats.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either using selective breeding or genetic
modification to breed plants with higher
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrient levels or higher protein levels
so we can get protein extracts more
[SPEAKER_07]: easily, get higher quality protein
extracts either for dietary supplements or
[SPEAKER_07]: for plant-based meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another project that we funded with the
Foundation for Food Agriculture and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Open Philanthropy Project is trying to
optimize the use of pulses for plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So along with identifying new or
underutilized sources of crops that we can
[SPEAKER_07]: use, we can also optimize crops that are
currently in use to be better for
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat to increase the amount of
protein in them or to increase the
[SPEAKER_07]: bioavailability of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: This project is characterizing the
texturization abilities and the molecular
[SPEAKER_07]: characterizations of pulse proteins
including where they bind to their
[SPEAKER_07]: molecules like flavor agents, how they
unfold during the cooking process,
[SPEAKER_07]: and computationally which genes can be
added or edited to produce varieties to
[SPEAKER_07]: improve in this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is too many words on one slide,
but this is basically a two-phase research
[SPEAKER_07]: process where in phase one they're using
high-throughput digital phenotyping and
[SPEAKER_07]: sequencing to functionally characterize a
variety of pulses with a focus on
[SPEAKER_07]: gelation, water-holding capacity,
and fat-binding ability, which are
[SPEAKER_07]: important for making a plant-based burger
or product that's going to be kind of a
[SPEAKER_07]: mixture of this protein slurry and some
kind of plant-based fat.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also looking at the structuring
ability of protein stem pulses or in these
[SPEAKER_07]: ingredient combinations to form a fibrous
structure that looks more like tissue that
[SPEAKER_07]: would kind of have this meat-like
appearance and texture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of this is going to be publicly
available online so that in the second
[SPEAKER_07]: phase they can use that data to perform
decision breeding to improve pulse crops
[SPEAKER_07]: for the explicit purpose of making these
crops better plant-based meat ingredients
[SPEAKER_07]: and cultivating them for plant-based meat
applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's an entire pulse council that is
supporting this and that thinks that one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the ways that they can improve the
market for pulses is by selling to kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: a growing plant-based meat market.
[SPEAKER_07]: This exemplifies some of the ways that
we're trying to make data collection and
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis available to researchers more
broadly so that we can have kind of a
[SPEAKER_07]: database of what crops are best for
plant-based meat, which genotypic and
[SPEAKER_07]: phenotypic characteristics lead to higher
protein expression levels so that people
[SPEAKER_07]: can then go on and do studies based on
that where they're trying to optimize
[SPEAKER_07]: other maybe crops or other plants that we
haven't identified as potential sources of
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat or do some of the studies
we're talking about like with soil
[SPEAKER_07]: condition to see which characteristics
then improve the bioavailability of the
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins in these crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another of the projects that we're funding
that's kind of similar to that is looking
[SPEAKER_07]: at fermentation of oat protein for
application in extruded meat analogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fermentation can improve the flavor of
oat protein, can produce additional
[SPEAKER_07]: lysine, which is one of the problems with
oat protein is that it has a limited
[SPEAKER_07]: amount of lysine that reduces its CDCAS
score.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oat protein also has some anti-nutrients,
some lectins and saponins that can be
[SPEAKER_07]: degraded through fermentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fermentation can produce
exopolysaccharides that improve the
[SPEAKER_07]: texture of the oat protein and it can
increase the overall nutrition and
[SPEAKER_07]: nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this group in Estonia is looking at
exploring how fermentation can affect the
[SPEAKER_07]: quality of oat protein and make a better
oat protein in terms of flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other ways that we can increase protein
yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this was not research that we
funded.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was just a paper that I thought was
interesting and exemplifies some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: ways that we can improve protein yield,
not just through targeting protein itself,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also through targeting plant growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this project was trying to improve
photo respiration so that the primary
[SPEAKER_07]: process, which is in gray, involves the
kind of expensive breakdown of glycolate
[SPEAKER_07]: and that they were trying to engineer
other glyoxalate processing mechanisms
[SPEAKER_07]: that would reduce kind of the time and the
cost to the plant of doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they found that this greatly increased
growth of the plant, though it's unclear
[SPEAKER_07]: whether that is passed on to subsequent
generations.
[SPEAKER_07]: The main idea here is that we are also
looking for research projects that would
[SPEAKER_07]: improve yield of plant proteins in terms
of increasing the size of proteins,
[SPEAKER_07]: shortening the growing time as well,
and not just increasing the protein
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration in seeds or in leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we've then chosen a plant that we
want to use in a plant protein product,
[SPEAKER_07]: we need better methods to isolate and
functionalize the raw materials for making
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based means.
[SPEAKER_07]: That can include better methods of protein
fractionation or isolation, as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: enzymatic functionalization, either
biologically or chemically, and
[SPEAKER_07]: hydrolyzation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can either look at chemically
isolating the raw materials that we want
[SPEAKER_07]: to use, or we can look at using mechanical
methods to separate the raw materials.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can look at soaking and using solvents,
milling or pounding to isolate various
[SPEAKER_07]: components of the plants, using enzymes
and extruders to restructure the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins so that they exhibit some of the
same functional properties that we want in
[SPEAKER_07]: animal proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And many of these can be optimized for
plant-based raw materials to improve
[SPEAKER_07]: digestibility, taste, and texture.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about what type of plant
protein we want to use, in some cases we
[SPEAKER_07]: want to use protein flour, in some cases
protein concentrate or protein isolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: These vary based on protein content,
based on how they're fractionated,
[SPEAKER_07]: what kind of fat they use.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the process by which soy protein is
produced from soybeans can kick out either
[SPEAKER_07]: soy flour, soy protein concentrate,
or soy protein isolate at these different
[SPEAKER_07]: steps.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soybeans themselves are cracked and
de-hulled.
[SPEAKER_07]: The hulls can be used as a product
themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they're flaked, and then you can
get soy oil from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's kind of a multi-step
process depending on what concentration of
[SPEAKER_07]: protein you want to get from the soybean.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then similarly in wheat, a multi-step
process depending on whether you want
[SPEAKER_07]: vital wheat gluten in your products,
whether you want textured wheat protein,
[SPEAKER_07]: isolated wheat protein, and what kind of
concentration of wheat protein you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So optimizing this process and looking at
other types of extrusion methods that can
[SPEAKER_07]: either involve lower temperatures or that
can involve higher pressure instead of
[SPEAKER_07]: enzymatic extrusion or hydrolysis could
improve the texture and could improve the
[SPEAKER_07]: functionality of the resulting protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: High pressure homogenization in particular
we're looking at because we know that
[SPEAKER_07]: taste is better in products that have a
higher protein concentration, but we're
[SPEAKER_07]: not entirely sure whether that's because
the processing steps that are used to
[SPEAKER_07]: improve, that are just going to
fractionate out the plant protein involve
[SPEAKER_07]: higher heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at whether higher
pressure can end up with a high
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration protein product that has the
same kind of lack of taste but doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: involve that heat treatment step.
[SPEAKER_07]: From there we want to make a formulation
from this plant protein product,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that involves adding binders,
adding flavorings, adding plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: fats, sometimes adding other ingredients
that will improve the taste or smell of
[SPEAKER_07]: the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of recapitulating the
experience of cooking, when we're looking
[SPEAKER_07]: at additives that are going to be flavor
and for the most part fragrance additives,
[SPEAKER_07]: we need something that's going to be
stable throughout the cooking process and
[SPEAKER_07]: that is also going to retain that same
flavor and that fragrance profile from a
[SPEAKER_07]: raw product through a cooked product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the reasons why Impossible Foods
decided to launch their burger in
[SPEAKER_07]: restaurants first was because they could
then kind of control the way that the end
[SPEAKER_07]: product was presented to consumers,
the Beyond Burger being available in
[SPEAKER_07]: grocery stores, you can take it home and
open it and a lot of people complain that
[SPEAKER_07]: it smells like cat food or that it has
this kind of like off scent in its raw or
[SPEAKER_07]: natural form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a course at Berkeley that I
advise and we work with Jeeva Dan on
[SPEAKER_07]: developing new flavoring agents for
plant-based meat products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the interesting things that we
find are that some of the molecules that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're looking at, like there's one
two-methyl five-butylene that smells like
[SPEAKER_07]: citrus at low concentrations, smells like
chicken at high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea is how can we control the
concentration profile of this chemical and
[SPEAKER_07]: we're adding it to a formulation that
people are then going to cook at home or
[SPEAKER_07]: make into meatballs at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another main component of optimizing
flavor is adding, so we'll talk about heme
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of the Impossible Burger and how
they've used a soy-like hemoglobin to
[SPEAKER_07]: recreate that kind of irony taste of like
the bloody components of meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Optimizing flavor also involves adding fat
and so one of the projects that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: funding at Berkeley involves encapsulating
sunflower oil in a commercially available
[SPEAKER_07]: saponin and then lyophilizing,
freeze-drying that, but it can be used as
[SPEAKER_07]: a shelf stable additive to any plant-based
meat formulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can have oil that you want it to be
encapsulated in some way because you want
[SPEAKER_07]: it to retain its position within the
overall kind of structure of the product
[SPEAKER_07]: through the cooking process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So brown beef has 40 different types of
fats that have different melting points
[SPEAKER_07]: and different levels of saturation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so throughout the cooking process,
they'll melt at different stages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them will remain solid at the end
of the cooking process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them melt at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're adding a plant-based fat,
you're pretty much adding one type of fat
[SPEAKER_07]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're adding sunflower oil or adding palm
oil or something and that has a particular
[SPEAKER_07]: melting point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the challenges is finding ways
of encapsulating that fat such that it
[SPEAKER_07]: will remain solid throughout the cooking
process so it doesn't immediately just
[SPEAKER_07]: leak out and you end up with a very dry
plant-based burger.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flavor and kind of off flavors in plant
proteins are one of the main problems for
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a project that we're funding in
China that's trying to identify what
[SPEAKER_07]: molecules are responsible for these kinds
of beany off flavors that are present in
[SPEAKER_07]: pea protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to identify which volatile compounds
contribute to that beany off flavor and
[SPEAKER_07]: then figure out ways of removing those
compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is primarily a project that's
using GC mass spec to first identify which
[SPEAKER_07]: volatiles are contributing to that off
flavor and then see if there are easy ways
[SPEAKER_07]: of extracting that through the process of
producing a pea protein isolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the other technical obstacles to
formulation include that in muscle,
[SPEAKER_07]: phosphates can draw protein from the meat
matrix or from the muscle to the surface
[SPEAKER_07]: and that can create kind of stickiness and
help with forming a coating on top of the
[SPEAKER_07]: meat product as it's cooking.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not sure if just adding phosphates
to plant-based meats is going to have the
[SPEAKER_07]: same functional properties A lot of times
we add starches to plant-based meat
[SPEAKER_07]: products as binders that can affect the
mouthfeel of the product and then we need
[SPEAKER_07]: to combine them with fiber in order to
have a better texture and better
[SPEAKER_07]: nutritional properties.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fiber itself though absorbs water and so
that can also affect mouthfeel even though
[SPEAKER_07]: it's an effective texture replacer for fat
you don't want to have too high of a fiber
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration in your products because
then that leads to more water absorbing
[SPEAKER_07]: product than you may want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can't fully replace starch with
fiber in the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to figure out the optimal
combination of starches and fibers and
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins that are going to make something
that has the same kind of bite and
[SPEAKER_07]: chewiness of whatever meat product we're
trying to replicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next step then is manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So taking this mixture of probably plant
protein, some kind of fat, some flavoring,
[SPEAKER_07]: some binder and taking that slurry and
processing it and so that can include
[SPEAKER_07]: extrusion, molding, dehydration,
shear cells, fiber spinning, 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as developing the sensing
technology so that we can determine at
[SPEAKER_07]: which point in for example an extrusion
process we're getting the right texture
[SPEAKER_07]: and under what conditions we're getting
the right texture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of plant-based meat is produced
through high moisture twin screw
[SPEAKER_07]: extrusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is kind of a machine that would be
about like the size of something you put
[SPEAKER_07]: on a factory floor like sometimes I put a
person here to show you that it's not like
[SPEAKER_07]: bench scale kind of factory scale
extrusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put that premixed kind of protein
slurry into a feeder and then there are
[SPEAKER_07]: co-rotating screws that are heated as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can affect, you can change what
type of protein comes out both by the
[SPEAKER_07]: final dye that cools the product and kind
of cuts it into shapes but also by the
[SPEAKER_07]: rate of co-rotation of those screws,
by the temperature, by the water
[SPEAKER_07]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea here is that we want to produce a
textured protein similar to the way that
[SPEAKER_07]: fiber spinning machines were originally
used to create soy protein fibers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make soybeans or soy protein
into products like soy curls or into
[SPEAKER_07]: products like any of these variety of
textures and shapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are all soy protein and what
we're varying here is water content,
[SPEAKER_07]: the dye, and the temperature used to
extrude them.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the other projects that we're
funding is developing real-time sensors
[SPEAKER_07]: for extrusion because we don't really know
when problems develop during extrusion
[SPEAKER_07]: until they come out the other end of the
dye.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this could be a project that would help
us improve the cost of diagnosing problems
[SPEAKER_07]: with plant protein extrusion and also
monitoring throughout the process through
[SPEAKER_07]: ultrasonic sensing within the actual twin
screw itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can see when we're getting a better
shape or when we're getting better fiber
[SPEAKER_07]: structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of what we do in order to help
companies develop these processes as well
[SPEAKER_07]: is do kind of back of the envelope
calculations or like economic monitoring
[SPEAKER_07]: of what the scale they would need to
produce would be if we want to meet
[SPEAKER_07]: certain targets of selling to selling a
certain amount of plant-based meat or
[SPEAKER_07]: producing a certain amount.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we look at just high moisture twin
screw extrusion, we can look at how many
[SPEAKER_07]: kilograms per hour of plant-based meat can
be produced in the average extruder,
[SPEAKER_07]: how long they're run.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we think that maybe we want 80% of
plant-based meat products on the market in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2020 to use extrusion, then we know about
how many industrial scale extruders we
[SPEAKER_07]: would need to have operating globally to
meet that demand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowing about the number of extruders that
are operating currently, it's fewer than
[SPEAKER_07]: 168.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about 130 or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would need to scale up the number of
extruders that are operating.
[SPEAKER_07]: One way we can do that is by encouraging
companies to have better monitoring so
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's more economically feasible for
them to increase the amount of extrusion
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But another way is to use other methods
that are maybe gentler that require lower
[SPEAKER_07]: temperatures and extrusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Wageningen University in the
Netherlands has developed something they
[SPEAKER_07]: were originally calling a couette cell and
now they're calling it a shear cell.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like an ice cream maker in
the sense that it has this large rotating
[SPEAKER_07]: ring on the outside and a static ring on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: You put your protein formulation in the
kind of barrel and the difference in
[SPEAKER_07]: rotation between the outer rim of the
outer rotating ring and the inner static
[SPEAKER_07]: rim sets up this shear gradient and that
aligns protein fibers in a way that helps
[SPEAKER_07]: them mimic muscle fiber itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is kind of what it looks like
coming out of the machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are some electron micrograph images
of how the protein ends up structured in
[SPEAKER_07]: these kind of fibrous aligned sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's what something like the below
image would look like when cooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it kind of replicates the texture and
the perception of fiber.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of these processing methods,
we also look at how processing affects
[SPEAKER_07]: both the chewiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can imagine that as you're rotating
and setting up this shear gradient,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're mixing the protein more,
maybe making it chewier, increasing
[SPEAKER_07]: gelation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we look at how heat and pressure
throughout these processing steps affects
[SPEAKER_07]: the hardness and the chewiness.
[SPEAKER_07]: In this case, a grape seed protein extract
so that we can target something that more
[SPEAKER_07]: closely mimics an animal protein that
we're looking to replicate.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also a company called Nova Meat
that's looking into 3D printing as an
[SPEAKER_07]: alternative to extrusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can use an ink that's a paper
paste of rice protein, pea protein,
[SPEAKER_07]: and seaweed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can add colors and flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, this is not something
that's going to scale up to meet the
[SPEAKER_07]: entire demand of plant-based protein that
we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can produce custom-designed
shapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's an alternative to extrusion if
you want to make something that is a very
[SPEAKER_07]: particular shape or size.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the projects that we're funding
that's looking at texture is looking at
[SPEAKER_07]: creating different meat-like textures by a
combination of microstructure,
[SPEAKER_07]: engineering, and thymistro extrusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea here is that they would form
kind of a plant protein matrix with one
[SPEAKER_07]: type of protein and then precipitate a
second protein over that, so like a pea
[SPEAKER_07]: protein precipitated over a wheat protein
or over a soy protein structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea is that this would help form a
fiber-like structure that's more similar
[SPEAKER_07]: to meat, and that's kind of a
fiber-reinforced polymer network with a
[SPEAKER_07]: fiber filler in this matrix.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then their idea is that different
meats have different fibrous textures,
[SPEAKER_07]: and so they can better target a texture
that mimics fish or that mimics beef or
[SPEAKER_07]: chicken through this precipitation process
of precipitating one protein on top of the
[SPEAKER_07]: construct of another protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: What proteins are used currently,
then, when we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger?
[SPEAKER_07]: The Impossible Burger, at least 1.0,
uses primarily wheat protein and potato
[SPEAKER_07]: protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Beyond Burger mostly pea protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's unique about these two burgers
or why we consider these more like the
[SPEAKER_07]: engineered plant protein products is,
at least in the Beyond Burger,
[SPEAKER_07]: the use of beet juice for color,
but more kind of interestingly in the
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible Burger, the use of soy,
like hemoglobin, the heme protein that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're actually producing in Pichia
pestoris and this yeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was kind of a novel ingredient
for them to produce.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me go ahead to like hemoglobin just
a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like hemoglobin, this globin protein,
what they're trying to replicate is
[SPEAKER_07]: myoglobin in muscle tissue or,
you know, myhemoglobin that transports
[SPEAKER_07]: iron through the bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's an iron binding protein,
it has this red color and it also gives it
[SPEAKER_07]: that kind of bloody taste.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they originally isolated the soy
like hemoglobin from these rhizomic
[SPEAKER_07]: nodules on the root of the soy plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that extraction process was costly and
required way too large volumes of soy root
[SPEAKER_07]: nodules to extract sufficient quantities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they ended up expressing it in yeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that required them actually to go
through an entire process of FDA approval
[SPEAKER_07]: to demonstrate that this was not,
in fact, a new product and that this was
[SPEAKER_07]: safe for human health.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they had to do some rat studies of
the soy like hemoglobin extracted from
[SPEAKER_07]: yeast, as well as improving the yield that
they would get from that process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally they were doing column
chromatography to extract the like
[SPEAKER_07]: hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was also too costly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were able to then improve yield
step by step so that they could just use
[SPEAKER_07]: weight fractionation and kind of have
these much larger kind of fermenters,
[SPEAKER_07]: but kind of similar to what you would see
like in a facility that's making beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can have, they can grow large
quantities of the yeast, but then they
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have to recover the same,
they didn't have to have like the same
[SPEAKER_07]: standard of recovery as they would from
column chromatography.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we know that the Beyond Burger and
the Beyond Burger is using pea protein,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we know that many plant-based burgers
are using that type of protein,
[SPEAKER_07]: another kind of economic analysis we can
do is figure out how many acres of peas we
[SPEAKER_07]: would need to grow in order to produce
enough pea protein for the projected
[SPEAKER_07]: amount of plant-based meat that we're
going to require in 2030 based on the
[SPEAKER_07]: growth of these companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can go through and look at how much
protein we get from pea.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, high protein varieties are about
25% protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: The project I talked about in Equinom
maybe can increase that, but right now
[SPEAKER_07]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look at what percent of protein a
plant-based meat product is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we assume what percentage of
plant-based meat is going to use pea
[SPEAKER_07]: protein as a predominant ingredient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go through some calculations to figure out
how many acres of peas we would need to
[SPEAKER_07]: have that we're just dedicated to
producing pea protein for plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: meat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that can help us project how we're
going to need to evaluate current land
[SPEAKER_07]: usage or how we should encourage farmers
to either grow more peas or sell peas into
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant-based meat market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing I want to point out here is
that both the Beyond Burger and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Impossible Burger use coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Beyond Burger also uses canola oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the main reasons for using
coconut oil is that it's solid at room
[SPEAKER_07]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you get that cooking process where
you can have a fat that stays solid
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we do kind of similar scaling
questions like this and look at the
[SPEAKER_07]: current coconut oil market and then
project demand for coconut oil just from
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based meat, we're going to reach
kind of peak coconut in about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we also need to start thinking about
how we can encourage coconut oil producers
[SPEAKER_07]: to grow more coconuts, produce more
coconut oil, assuming that we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have similar demand trajectories for the
Impossible Burger and Beyond Burger that
[SPEAKER_07]: use this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why do we think we're going to continue
to have similar demand trajectories for
[SPEAKER_07]: these?
[SPEAKER_07]: We do see increasing investment in terms
of both plant-based meat and clean meat
[SPEAKER_07]: year over year in terms of both deal
volume and amount raised.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can break that out into plant-based
meat on the left as having raised the
[SPEAKER_07]: highest amount with the second highest
number of deals, plant-based egg and
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based dairy close behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clean meat, clean eggs, clean dairy,
because we think that those products are
[SPEAKER_07]: still at least 10 years out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've raised less money.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of more exploratory.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we see a lot of funding going into the
development of plant-based meat,
[SPEAKER_07]: both research funding and commercial
funding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we also see that's interesting is
that a lot of kind of traditional meat
[SPEAKER_07]: companies like Tyson and Cargill are also
investing in plant-based meat with the
[SPEAKER_07]: idea that they want to be protein
providers and that if there are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be multiple sources from which people get
their protein, they want to be part of
[SPEAKER_07]: that market, not kind of be disrupted in
that sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to touch on some of that kind of
white space ideas in plant-based protein
[SPEAKER_07]: that we are trying to find researchers who
are willing to work on because we have
[SPEAKER_07]: this competitive grant proposal process
that we run every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: We give out $5 million in grant funding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or really, we give out as much money as we
can raise to give out because we're a
[SPEAKER_07]: nonprofit seed research project where we
can.
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the ones that we are
interested in people working on are,
[SPEAKER_07]: like we talked about, increasing the yield
and robustness of crops that are used for
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based proteins, adapting tolerance
to climate change to expand the regions in
[SPEAKER_07]: which these crops can be grown,
expand their growing profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Improve the amino acid profile to produce
more complete proteins in a different
[SPEAKER_07]: variety of crops that we don't always have
to rely on soy when we want that complete
[SPEAKER_07]: protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Improve the flavor profile, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So decreasing the concentrations of
saponins that can be bitter, isoplavones
[SPEAKER_07]: and lipoxygenases that can lead to those
kinds of grassy and beany off flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that producing fats in algae
would be a good way to both utilize algae
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of extracting protein from it,
as well as using it to produce omega-3 or
[SPEAKER_07]: omega-6 fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at funding platforms that
assess different characteristics of plant
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins within processed ingredient
batches to increase consistency of
[SPEAKER_07]: downstream processing.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we do tests of pea protein,
if we imagine that we are a plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: meat company, we're trying to buy lots of
pea protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part, they include not just
one varietal of pea, but they'll include
[SPEAKER_07]: multiple types of yellow, in some cases
also of green, green pea.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're highly variable and they're not
from one particular growing region or from
[SPEAKER_07]: one particular set of soil characteristics
or growth characteristics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to be able to improve the
consistency of plant proteins that are
[SPEAKER_07]: available so we can improve the
consistency of the end product when it's
[SPEAKER_07]: using something like pea protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of functionalization,
we're interested in projects that perform
[SPEAKER_07]: customized processing of raw plant protein
ingredients to the specification of a
[SPEAKER_07]: client's functionalization desires.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the inconsistency in plant proteins
in terms of functional properties is a
[SPEAKER_07]: hurdle for companies that are buying large
quantities of pea protein and can't rely
[SPEAKER_07]: on consistency batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking at projects that remove or
mask off flavors in plant-based proteins
[SPEAKER_07]: that can develop better tasting products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of the holy grail for plant protein
is just a protein that doesn't taste like
[SPEAKER_07]: anything, just hard to achieve,
and particularly in something like soy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at ways to maybe mask those
types of flavors in plant-based proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking at developing new binders,
new plant-based fats, pre-textured
[SPEAKER_07]: proteins, and looking at better methods of
extrusion for creating that fibrousness in
[SPEAKER_07]: a plant-based meat product, better sensors
for monitoring quality of plant-based
[SPEAKER_07]: meats through the extrusion process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the opportunities that we're also
looking at are blended proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like Sonic makes a blended burger that
is partially beef blended with mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we think that this is a way that we
can get more plant protein ingredients
[SPEAKER_07]: into consumer diets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can have something that's a blend of
an animal protein and plant protein,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that will also increase our ability to
feed 10 billion people by 2050.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the final kind of call to action is
if we look at global R&D investment into
[SPEAKER_07]: renewable energy in 2011, when this had
captured both a lot of government funding
[SPEAKER_07]: and a lot of private funding, we can see
that a lot of the money that was spent
[SPEAKER_07]: into developing renewable energy went into
types of energy that aren't currently
[SPEAKER_07]: being used or that weren't feasible.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been able to make biofuels
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then if we compare that to the amount
of R&D that's gone into meat alternatives
[SPEAKER_07]: of just about 1 billion, we have
plant-based meat and meat alternatives
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really think that with the addition
of more funding, both governmental funding
[SPEAKER_07]: and industry funding, we'll be able to
make much better plant-based meat products
[SPEAKER_07]: and improve the development of these
products to address a similar environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all from me.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one minute to lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: There may be questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if there's been any
looking into about growing protein-based
[SPEAKER_08]: plants in marginal environments,
because that's an argument some people in
[SPEAKER_08]: the animal science community make about
where beef cattle are grazed on the map.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the projects that we're funding to
look at how soil characteristics vary in
[SPEAKER_07]: environments where there's a lot of growth
of lupins and of millet is aimed at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're wondering whether we can optimize
some of these crops so they produce at
[SPEAKER_07]: least 25% protein at soil conditions that
normally wouldn't be used for growing
[SPEAKER_07]: those crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're looking at that in Israel and in
Canada and in India.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of either soils with varying
nitrogen concentrations or areas where
[SPEAKER_07]: there's higher drought and looking at some
of these crops that can be improved to be
[SPEAKER_07]: drought tolerant but still retain about
25% protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not ideal, but yeah, part of the
projection of how many people are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have to feed also includes under what
conditions we're going to have to feed
[SPEAKER_07]: them and the idea that we're going to have
higher temperatures and more drought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that increases the number of areas
where we're going to have to grow these
[SPEAKER_07]: crops in substandard conditions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know for some of the plant-based milk
products like almond milk, soy milk,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's some controversy about standards
of identity and calling it milk.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm kind of curious and for the
plant-based meats and these other
[SPEAKER_10]: products, this industry has been around
long enough that they haven't come up with
[SPEAKER_10]: a better name than plant-based meat,
but is there a standard of identity
[SPEAKER_10]: conflict coming?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because these products are obviously very
diverse.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you comment on that at all?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so there are several state bills
that are pending and then Missouri passed
[SPEAKER_07]: a bill recently to prohibit these products
from using the term meat and so we're kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of fighting that bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: But on the state level, there are kind of
cattlemen's association groups and other
[SPEAKER_07]: like industry groups that are trying to
restrict the use of terms like chicken or
[SPEAKER_07]: sausage or bacon.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the most part, because there's been
such a long history of these products
[SPEAKER_07]: being sold under a similar name,
we can say that there's not consumer
[SPEAKER_07]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, on a state level, there are a
couple of different bills, mostly in
[SPEAKER_07]: states that have like large ranching
interests or that have a lot of meat
[SPEAKER_07]: production like Missouri and some of the
other states where they're trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: restrict the use of those particular like
pork or chicken or beef terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't come up with a really good
alternative name, so we just kind of have
[SPEAKER_07]: to fight that legislatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I wasn't sure if you might be able
to comment on that, but there's been work
[SPEAKER_01]: done on trying to make a vegan cheese,
sort of like a plant-based cheese
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative, but it seems like there has
not been much progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The taste does not seem to equate to what
milk-based cheese can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you comment on that, what's available?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, there's a couple different
products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the ones that we work with
is Miyoko's Kitchen and I'm also like
[SPEAKER_07]: privileged because in the Bay Area we have
access to all of these because so many of
[SPEAKER_07]: these companies are headquartered in the
Bay Area and so distribution both across
[SPEAKER_07]: the country and globally is a problem,
but most of the problem with making a
[SPEAKER_07]: vegan cheese is in like meltability.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can get like spreadable cheeses or
something that has the same kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: texture as like feta cheese or something
that's more like crumbly, but getting a
[SPEAKER_07]: plant protein that melts in the same way
and it retains fat in the same way that
[SPEAKER_07]: dairy cheese does has been a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Miyoko's does the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also like Light Life that has some
of these Daya that's like a shredded
[SPEAKER_07]: plant-based cheese, active R&B in terms of
making better melting characteristics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, so there seems to be a trend within
the food industry away from
[SPEAKER_05]: ultra-processed products toward clean
label foods and I'm curious if that's an
[SPEAKER_05]: obstacle or if it's just a new point
because higher level values of
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainability set in or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's something that kind of industry
struggles with as well as nutrition
[SPEAKER_07]: because I mean both the Beyond Burger and
the Impossible Burger like have similar
[SPEAKER_07]: fat content to a ground beef burger and
they're not necessarily marketed as like a
[SPEAKER_07]: health product.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just marketed as something that's
supposed to replace a meat product and
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah for the most part anything that we're
making is highly processed as you can see
[SPEAKER_07]: like the protein extraction, protein
extrusion process itself makes it in that
[SPEAKER_07]: category.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the most part based on the idea
that when we do surveys about like 1% of
[SPEAKER_07]: the US will admit to being vegetarian and
like half of them are probably lying and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a relatively small like target
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the most part what these companies
are trying to do is get people who are
[SPEAKER_07]: carnivores or herpetarians to like try
this product that's just going to be a
[SPEAKER_07]: substitute in terms of taste and price and
not looking as much into replacing like
[SPEAKER_07]: the less processed foods that represent a
smaller proportion of the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's definitely a concern for like a lot
of people that I work with because when
[SPEAKER_07]: you work at a think tank that supports
this like a lot of people that I work with
[SPEAKER_07]: are vegan or vegetarian and are also
concerned with like concerned with food
[SPEAKER_07]: processing, concerned with eating more raw
foods.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would say that's still relatively a
niche concern as compared to taste and
[SPEAKER_07]: price lower down on the consumer checklist
in terms of choosing what to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that yeast fermentation
improved the lysine content of oat
[SPEAKER_03]: protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this work for wheat and barley too?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh the oat protein fermentation project?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I don't see why it wouldn't but we
haven't found researchers who are willing
[SPEAKER_07]: to study that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you would like to study that apply
to our grant program this fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah I mean so one of the problems
with oat protein that they are trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: improve is the amino acid profile and so
that's relatively unique to oat in terms
[SPEAKER_07]: of the lower levels of lysine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the saponin content is not present
in wheat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's nothing to say that
fermentation wouldn't improve the taste
[SPEAKER_07]: profile of wheat or barley as well when
we're looking particularly in terms of how
[SPEAKER_07]: well it can mimic wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking of these plant-based protein as a
consumer product the price that it has is
[SPEAKER_00]: it mostly due to because it's actually
that complex to make or is it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: new and the company needs to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of curious how the price would
compare if like meat was priced as
[SPEAKER_00]: expensively as it should given all the
inputs that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would it actually compete in that
regard?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I mean all the companies are aiming
for price parity.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Beyond Burger is probably like a
dollar or so per burger more expensive
[SPEAKER_07]: than ground beef.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it is to recap R&D costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it is because the processing steps
are more involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of the cost also comes from the
fat that they need to add to it in terms
[SPEAKER_07]: of the price of coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as they're able to scale up and so
like as they're increasing the size of
[SPEAKER_07]: their facilities that price should come
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually when both Beyond and Impossible
did a lifecycle analysis of the product
[SPEAKER_07]: they found that not only one of the main
contributors to water use and to
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse gas emissions but also one of
the main contributors to price was the
[SPEAKER_07]: packaging materials that they're using.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to look into better and
also more biodegradable trays and plastic
[SPEAKER_07]: wraps so they can sell it in a way that it
looks like it's packaged like it's ground
[SPEAKER_07]: beef but in something that's more easily
recyclable because that ended up being one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the primary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that like packaging is also
contributing to cost.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it seems like there are many issues
that could be helped with genetic
[SPEAKER_12]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean things like hydrogenation levels of
non-coconut oils and fats and stuff like
[SPEAKER_12]: that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that something that you guys are sort
of actively trying to stay away from?
[SPEAKER_12]: So can't somebody out there make synthetic
you know make canola make coconut oil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally yeah I mean ideally you'd be able
to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one of the projects that's
trying to look at algae as a way that we
[SPEAKER_07]: can produce some of these fats
exogenously.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cost is probably still going to be an
issue but yeah hopefully we can use some
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of platform like a yeast or bacterial
platform to produce the oils that we would
[SPEAKER_07]: need.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other?
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of nutritional quality you
showed a graph of the different iron
[SPEAKER_09]: contents of some crops that people are
using for these plant-based meats.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they also measuring phytate levels to
try to get at maybe some of the iron
[SPEAKER_09]: bioavailability issues that might come
with plants replacing meats?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah particularly in like millet and
lupins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in general just the bioavailability of
the protein in the plants that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to engineer to have higher protein
content.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like so in the in the pea study we
weren't just trying to increase the
[SPEAKER_07]: percentage of protein available in the
dried pea but also then the
[SPEAKER_07]: bioavailability of that protein as it's
processed or cooked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we don't want to increase the
protein concentration but not be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: then extract that protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's also part of what Equinom is
looking into.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe one last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that food will be affordable
in 2050 if we use this method?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's a very expensive process so I
believe we'll have available food but do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think it will be affordable at that
time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I mean yeah decreasing cost is a
concern and we're also looking at how how
[SPEAKER_07]: the cost of producing livestock might
increase as we're either as either the
[SPEAKER_07]: crops that we use to feed the livestock
increase in price or as we're running out
[SPEAKER_07]: of room as in the case with like fisheries
we're running out of coastline that can be
[SPEAKER_07]: leased to produce those fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're both trying to reduce the price
of plant-based meat and then also looking
[SPEAKER_07]: at maybe some kind of like intersecting
curve of prices where we would see the
[SPEAKER_07]: price of animal meat increase and then
match prices.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the like the least expensive way to
eat would just be to eat some of these
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetables and pulses and grains like on
their own to not try to make them into
[SPEAKER_07]: something like the Beyond Burger,
the Impossible Burger.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea behind those is that we want to
replace something that's agriculturally
[SPEAKER_07]: inefficient with something that is and
hopefully drive the price down there but
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah as price is a concern like we can oh
we have that graph of the different
[SPEAKER_07]: protein levels and protein sources and so
like yes you can meet your daily protein
[SPEAKER_07]: requirement just with vegetable proteins
and those are cheaper on the whole to
[SPEAKER_07]: reduce and buy than animal based proteins.
[SPEAKER_07]: From a purely economic standpoint like
sure don't buy the Impossible Burger just
[SPEAKER_07]: buy like rice and lentils and just cook
them however you like with other
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetables but if we want to replace meat
in people's diets.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one final question from Zoom.
[SPEAKER_11]: Andrea Beldy asks besides the process of
oat fermentation are you also looking into
[SPEAKER_11]: improving the quality of the protein of
these crops by GM or other means?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they asked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah yeah so like some of the studies that
Equinom is doing are looking at improving
[SPEAKER_07]: the concentrations and availability of
that protein also improving the
[SPEAKER_07]: completeness of the protein itself so yeah
GM is one way to do that and the
[SPEAKER_07]: particular like oat protein project is
just looking at fermentation because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're a lab that studies fermentation so
they had this idea that fermentation would
[SPEAKER_07]: be kind of like an easy and cost-effective
way to to improve the completeness of the
[SPEAKER_07]: oat protein and to decrease the
concentrations of isoflavones and saponins
[SPEAKER_07]: in the oat protein extract but certainly
another lab may be able to improve oat
[SPEAKER_07]: protein in a different process.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right can we all join and thank
Alison.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu Thank
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
