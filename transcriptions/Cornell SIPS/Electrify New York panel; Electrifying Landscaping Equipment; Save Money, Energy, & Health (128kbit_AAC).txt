[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ken Astis Jr. I'm honored to be
here today to assist in this program,
[SPEAKER_00]: to share my experience within the
landscape industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 25 years in that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: More significantly, I wanted to talk about
the remarkable transformation that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in the landscape industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: across New York, particularly the pivotal
switch from traditional gas powered tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to advanced electric alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This narrative is not only about my
personal evolution, but also about the
[SPEAKER_00]: collective journey of our industry as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's travel back to 1997, the year I
boldly adventured into the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping with the establishment of
Astis Country Gardens and Design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fueled by a passion and a desire to create
stunning outdoor landscaping spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my first significant investment,
which was a John Deere diamond blade
[SPEAKER_00]: cutoff saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so excited about that tool and what
it was going to accomplish me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was sort of like getting my first car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became an integral part of who I was in
my projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used it to cut concrete and create
beautiful landscapes all over New York and
[SPEAKER_00]: even into Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became an integral part of my identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as I reflect on my career,
I cannot ignore the toll that demand of
[SPEAKER_00]: that industry has taken on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes beyond the physical labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience highlighted in the cost
associated with using gas powered tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: After years of relying on that reliable
demo saw and other gas powered equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: I now find myself wearing hearing aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite my constant use of hearing
protection, it was insufficient to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing loss, which I have suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reminding us of the numerous challenges
that are faced with the landscape industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that my fellow colleagues deal with every
day and the profession as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it resonates with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we all can have encountered
that moment of irritation, haven't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: That frustration of reaching for a gas
powered tool and to find out it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It refused to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You twist the cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check the fuel and sometimes out of
sheer annoyance, you resort to a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: some colorful language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't count the times that I've paddled
a tool that was in cooperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That precious work hours slipped away as
you work diligently to try to transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads me to pivot a moment in my
career that I transitioned from electric
[SPEAKER_00]: to electric tools, gladly making the
conscious choice to invest in electric
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I proudly own several electric
tools, chainsaws, weed whackers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a variety of other electrical
landscaping tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might wonder why I made this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantages of switching to electric
tools are not just appealing, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, we need to address our
health concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those consideration, noise pollution is
a significant concern in our industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: the transition to electric tools can lead
to substantial reduction in sound levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now work without insensitive roars
of the gas powered engine, which not only
[SPEAKER_00]: is a safeguard for my hearing,
but also creates more harmonious work
[SPEAKER_00]: environments for my team, the clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine a job site where you're working
and you're able to hear the birds and the
[SPEAKER_00]: various wildlife around you not being
smothered by the sound of a growling gas
[SPEAKER_00]: engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Convenience is another factor to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric tools operate with simple push of
a push button button, no more struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: with pull cords or intricacies of a gas
powered engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tools require far less maintenance
and they are much easier to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means we can devote less time to
troubleshooting and more time to what
[SPEAKER_00]: truly matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've discovered that my efficiencies with
the gas powered tool away from the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: powered trues allow me to compete,
complete more swiftly and do additional
[SPEAKER_00]: work because of that not having to deal
with that annoyance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, transitioning to electric
tools is not without hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many professionals in our field,
the prospects of making this switch can
[SPEAKER_00]: feel overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most significant challenges is
the initial financial outlays that go on
[SPEAKER_00]: with the transitioning to electric tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often come with a higher price tag to
the gas powered counterparts and compose a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial obstacle for some small
businesses and independent landscapers
[SPEAKER_00]: that manage tight financials constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, there's the adjustment
period associated with transitioning from
[SPEAKER_00]: a gas powered tool that you've relied on
for years and decades to transition to
[SPEAKER_00]: electric tool, particularly if you've been
relying on that for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfort and familiarity breed a sense of
security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're stepping into a little bit of
unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Battery life is another concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: While advancements in battery technology
have enhanced the viability of electric
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, some landscapers worry about the
running out of power mid project,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can lead to delays and frustrations
like you did with the gas powered tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's gel delve deeper into the trade
offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concerning costs is truly that the initial
investment of electric tools can be
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's crucial to consider the long
term savings that come with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their use gas powered tools often carry
hidden expenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the fuel, you have oil,
regular maintenance that can accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: over time and be significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the repairs required for
gas powered engines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many carburetors I've
repaired with tools and those intricate
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses that are associated with a gas
powered tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversely, electric tools typically offer
a more economical operational model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of electricity have often been
lower than that of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the reduction in maintenance
requirements, you'll save both time,
[SPEAKER_00]: money, and in the long haul, a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electric equipment has a fewer moving
parts, leads to a decreased mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: failures that translates to a lower repair
cost and a more dependable overall
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, we cannot overlook the
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of our choice, gas powered tools
contribute to the greenhouse gases,
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions, and noise that was mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That pollution issues that increasingly
present in our battle against climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: By making the switch to electric tools,
we can not only prioritize health,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also play an essential role in
reducing our carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: As New York embraces the ambition
decarbonization goals, the transition to
[SPEAKER_00]: electric landscaping tools, one cog in
that wheel of that pie aligns seamlessly
[SPEAKER_00]: with our collective mission to foster a
cleaner and more sustainable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a unique opportunity to pioneer in
this, my industry, transforming our shift
[SPEAKER_00]: within the landscape industry by adopting
electric tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can inspire others and lead through a
movement towards sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I stand before you today, I implore all
my landscape professionals to thoroughly
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate their equipment choices and to
contemplate the possibilities of switching
[SPEAKER_00]: to electric.
[SPEAKER_00]: This transition is not merely a regulatory
obligation, it's a representation,
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity to innovate and embrace a
more sustainable future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I envision a world where we can create
beautiful landscapes without compromising
[SPEAKER_00]: our health or contributing to the
environmental degradation that we all are
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, we can forge a path towards
sustainable practices in our industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: that change can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: By transitioning to electric tools,
we can safeguard not only our wellbeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For future generations, it's our duty as
landscape professionals to lead by example
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocate for practices that prioritize
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closing, my journey from the initial
diamond blade cutoff saw to a
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive collection of electric tools
is a testament to the transformative
[SPEAKER_00]: potential within the landscaping industry
that can take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: This journey transcends mere equipment,
it encompasses our health, our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and the future we aspire to
create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's embrace this change not only for
ourselves, but for the next generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape professionals, homeowners,
and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, we can cultivate a vibrant
landscape industry that champions
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here today and
contemplating this role that we can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: this transformation from gas power tools
to electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
