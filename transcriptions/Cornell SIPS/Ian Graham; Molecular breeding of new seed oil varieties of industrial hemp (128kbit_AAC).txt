[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I think the numbers have stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you already know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Lucia Vignale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm organizing our lab's annual hemp
webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a third year PhD candidate in the
Larry Smart Lab at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm working on hemp powder mildew in
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are focusing on hemp grain this year,
and today's speaker is Ian Graham.
[SPEAKER_01]: Graham, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is joining us from the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ian, for accepting our
invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all excited to hear your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Following a postdoctoral fellowships at
the University of Oxford and Carnage
[SPEAKER_01]: Department Plant Biology in Stanford,
California, Ian took a faculty position
[SPEAKER_01]: and set up his own lab in the UK at the
University of Glasgow in 1994,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was born.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1999, he moved to become the Western
Chair of Biochemical Genetics in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Center for Novel Agricultural Products at
the University of York, where he remains
[SPEAKER_01]: with his research focused on biosynthesis
of plant natural products and how these
[SPEAKER_01]: can be developed for various industrial
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Representing the University of York,
Ian was granted the UK Plant Breeders'
[SPEAKER_01]: Right for a high oleic hemp seed variety
in February of 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian was selected a fellow of the Royal
Society in 2016, and this is a science
[SPEAKER_01]: trustee of the Royal Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian is also the academic lead for
BioJourkshire, a partnership involving the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of York, Ferroscience and
Ascamp Ryan College that aims to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: green economic growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian is the director for the UK government
funded high value biorenewables network.
[SPEAKER_01]: The title of his talk is Molecular
Breeding of New Seed Oil Varieties of
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The webinars are recorded and uploaded to
our School of Integrative Plant Science
[SPEAKER_01]: SIPP YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to check the four previous ones
that we have already uploaded to our
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, the virtual stage is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now your turn, Ian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should first of all apologize for
providing you with such a long bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken about five minutes of our
valuable time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great pleasure to have had this
invitation from Lucia and the people at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great idea to have it such
a global seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly didn't appreciate it was so
global, but welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for turning up to listen to
me for the next 40 or 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a story which is really close to
my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working on hemp in the
background of my other main projects on
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants for the last 15 years
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, as in other places,
getting funding to work on hemp has never
[SPEAKER_00]: been all that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe getting a little bit easier now
with the relax in regulations around
[SPEAKER_00]: planting and growing and all of that,
especially in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a great opportunity to tell
you about some of the work that we've done
[SPEAKER_00]: and also maybe give you some insight into
seed biology, which is another one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: interests and has been since I started my
lab the year that Lucia was born,
[SPEAKER_00]: as she pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of makes me feel a bit old,
but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So molecular breeding of new seed oil
varieties of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think industrial hemp, when you talk
about it, most people think about fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my focus and my interests over the
last 40 odd years have been very much on
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and oil and then progressing into
other exotic medicinal crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept which I'm going to introduce
and many of you will be familiar with in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of altering traits in industrial
hemp varieties is reverse genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really going from gene to
phenotype rather than forward genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going from phenotype to gene as
it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the potential of reverse
genetics in orphan crops, orphan crops
[SPEAKER_00]: being those that are not all that well
studied or being developed by molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding tools in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole revolution in DNA sequencing and
knowledge of the genome and genome
[SPEAKER_00]: assemblies now as well greatly facilitate
this concept of reverse genetics because
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get to so-called candidate genes
much, much easier than we ever could
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you some insight into how we
went about doing this even before that
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution had really taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, let's talk a little bit
about industrial hemp It's of course a
[SPEAKER_00]: multipurpose crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use that terminology industrial hemp
for low cannabinoid hemp that's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly for fiber and seed and then from
seed oil applications, as you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see in my talk, that whole
concept of doing transcriptome analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: has allowed us to identify genes and
modify genes involved in the seed oil
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, in fact, in Canada,
industrial hemp is still growing largely
[SPEAKER_00]: for seed rather than fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's huge potential to develop this
crop as a multipurpose crop for fiber as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'll just say initially that
hemp has been grown a very, very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in the UK during the reign of
Henry VIII when in the 1600s, every farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and farmer in the country was legally
obliged to grow a root which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: about a third of an acre of hemp because
it was so much in need for sailing ships,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the sails and for the rope of those
sailing ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's been a very important
part of the UK as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fallen right back and my ambition
is to really increase the acreage of it
[SPEAKER_00]: again from something like 800 hectares
that are grown mainly for fiber in the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little bit then about the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to dwell on this because
those of you tuned in, you're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in hemp, you'll know all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an annual herbaceous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make the point that you get
both monaceous and dioecious varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dioecious varieties are those where the
male and female flowers are on separate
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that introduces challenges itself to
breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it basically behaves like separate male
and female individuals for crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've mentioned the different drug
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It originated in Europe, Northern India
and Persia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's now cultivated around the world
in warm to temperate regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are good claims around it being
used for low-input farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in the UK, one of my
ambitions is to really get it adopted as a
[SPEAKER_00]: break crop to grow on good, arable land
where cereals are growing, where every
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four years you need to have a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the minute that's large,
that break crop is often oilseed rape or
[SPEAKER_00]: canola as you refer to it in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all sorts of issues with that
as being really terms of, in fact in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe now, the main sprays that are used
in canola are being banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are looking for alternative
break crops and industrial hemp is one
[SPEAKER_00]: such that could really be adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers like growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the applications are in fiber and
cannabinoids and in seed oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industrial hemp varieties,
they need to be below 0.2% THC in the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to get a license to grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the other places at 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you just take a look at this
seed, it's got about 30 to 35% oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amino acid composition is really,
really good for human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go into health food shops,
you can often buy hemp seed powder because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the protein composition and the oil as
we'll come onto is also very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for dietary fiber, vitamins and
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutritionally, it's very interesting
and is usually in those high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritious foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started this project and in
fact, still in North America, this
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, canola is one of the favorites
that's grown in Canada in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other options as well,
of course, but canola itself is
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively dwarf variety,
which means that you can combine harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: it for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early flowering at 25 to 30 days,
early maturing at 115 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really nice diploid variety
that we really like to grow and work with
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New York as well, because it's
fast cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get a couple of generations in a
year, for example, under glass and can be
[SPEAKER_00]: grown at high latitudes, hence its
popularity in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good rotation crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put in here a seed yield of one to
two hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's claims out there that you can get
above two hectares and it's like any crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get out what you put in and so it
depends on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the conditions for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say something about the actual fatty
acid composition, because it's the fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acid composition in the seed oil that
makes it interesting in particular for
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've got here is the
different types of fatty acids along the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've compared hemp with,
or this table compares hemp with other oil
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see immediately that hemp has
got high levels of linoleic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 18 carbons, two double bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this numbering represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alpha-linolenic acid, which is 18
carbons, three double bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come on to this in my biochemistry
tutorial in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the interesting one that I'll be
focusing on is oleic acid, which is 18
[SPEAKER_00]: carbons, one double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see that the number of
double bonds increases as we go across
[SPEAKER_00]: this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this PUFA is polyunsaturated fatty
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that polyunsaturated is
anything more than one double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the level of PUFAs in
hemp is high at 84%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare that with olive oil,
then you can see immediately that olive
[SPEAKER_00]: oil has got an elevated levels of oleic
acid, 18 carbons, one double bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of these other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutritionally and health-wise,
both alpha-linolenic acid, which has got
[SPEAKER_00]: three double bonds, and gamma-linolenic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come on to these in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that many of these oil crops
don't have any GLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is relatively special, let's say,
rather than unique, in having a 4% GLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ALA-GLA, which is omega-3 and
omega-6 oils, again, many of you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware and may indeed take them as
supplements, are important for your
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were interested in this when we
thought about changing the composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously, if you compare the
levels of GLA, gamma-linolenic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: to borage, which is very well known to
have elevated levels of GLA, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: nice to have more GLA in hemp oil,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the issues with polyunsaturated
fatty acids is that they are oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They become oxidized as soon as you take
them out of the seed and in that
[SPEAKER_00]: protective capsule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, just like fish oil,
which has got elevated levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: polyunsaturated fatty acids, in fact,
20 carbon and 22 carbon fatty acids in
[SPEAKER_00]: fish oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that smell of fish oil that you get
when the fish isn't fresh is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish oil is becoming oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exactly the same happens, in fact,
with hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take it and leave it open to the
air, it becomes rancid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that, it's not really
all that attractive for cooking or for
[SPEAKER_00]: processing, for processed foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously, then one of the targets
could be, how could you make this fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acid composition more like olive oil and
increase the amount of oleic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so doing, you would predict
increases stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was sort of the context that
we came into this project to see if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could do something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just want to then summarize
very quickly what happens in a developing
[SPEAKER_00]: seed when fatty acids are being made that
accumulate in the seed to give that
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable oil that we get from all plant
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, and also, in fact, from olive
oil, which, of course, isn't derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got here, this is the
plastid, which most of you will be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of that's present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is involved largely in
photosynthesis, but it's also involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: that first stage of fatty acid
biosynthesis in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, fatty acids are synthesized
in developing seeds and in seeds all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant, up until they reach that
18 carbon one double bond, oleic acid that
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a fatty acid desaturase that's
soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite unique in just having this
job of converting 16-0 to 16-1 palmitoleic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid and stearic acid to 18-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fatty acids come out into the
cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is this whole suite of fatty
acid desaturases then that keep
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing more desaturation and double
bonds into that fatty acid backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know a lot about these from work
done in other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a so-called delta-12 desaturase,
which introduces this fatty acid double
[SPEAKER_00]: bond to get linoleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a delta-15 desaturase
that takes it onto alpha-linolenic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a different desaturase,
which converts linoleic acid to
[SPEAKER_00]: gamma-linolenic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between gamma and
alpha, as you'll see on the next slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that they occur at different positions
on the fatty acid backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now a depiction of a fatty
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is oleic acid with just one double
bond at the double bond at the nine carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what comes out of the plastid and
then gets acted on by these membrane bound
[SPEAKER_00]: desaturases that then introduce another
double bond at the 12 carbon position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get 18-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have, as I said, this
delta-60 desaturase, which then gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha-linolenic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a delta-15 desaturase,
which gives you alpha-linolenic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see where we're going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that you need to understand and
identify those desaturases before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: modify them in whatever way you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, what we've got is now a
developing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the embryo of the developing
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see over a couple of months,
this embryo matures from torpedo stage to
[SPEAKER_00]: upturn stage to this is filled but not
desiccated stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: FND.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we looked at the
transcriptome of these developing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified using bioinformatics,
a whole bunch of candidate desaturase
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there is homology between
genes, we then used functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized desaturases from other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified, so this is a fatty acid
desaturase 2A and 2B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, these are the desaturase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nomenclature here is confusing in the
literature as well for people not
[SPEAKER_00]: lipidologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this naming came from mutants and
Arabidopsis, in fact, FAD2, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: delta-12 desaturase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the FAD2A and FAD2B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a heat map showing level
of expression in the developing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see immediately that this
FAD2A, if we're interested in identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: this delta-12 desaturase, is a really
strong candidate because it's got this
[SPEAKER_00]: really high level expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, you can identify for these
other desaturases candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, they're only candidates
until you really prove the gene function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is exactly what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were then able to then further
explore the function of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then, rather than just rely on gene
expression data and counting the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts that we come across in gene
expression data, this slide comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, oh, sorry, you can see
that for this delta-12 desaturase that we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the expression of two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is very impressive in terms
of a potential candidate for developing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because it shows this massive
expression at this filled, not desiccated
[SPEAKER_00]: stage when the fatty acids are being made
and the oil is accumulating in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the mature seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is young leaf and mature leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, when you're interested in
finding mutations that will alter seed
[SPEAKER_00]: development or in any kind of way,
you want to find genes that are only
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in the seeds because you don't
want to have an effect elsewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you could see then this
second gene is very, very lowly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene immediately became our
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing we did is we took
the cDNA, the protein encoding region of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene and overexpressed that in
saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer's yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really good model for
understanding fatty acid functional gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression because the wild type brewer's
yeast only makes 16-1 and 18-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes the fatty acids which you find
in the plastered of a plant, but not any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those more sophisticated fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you express that candidate
gene, you can see immediately that the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of 16-1 goes down from this level to
this level, but you get 16-2 appearing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you express this gene in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the 18-1 goes down and you
get an appearance of 18-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really good evidence that we
have indeed got a hemp gene encoding the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme which is responsible for
desaturating oleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the same thing with that
series of candidate genes for the Delta-15
[SPEAKER_00]: desaturase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a gene which was
predominantly this time some expression in
[SPEAKER_00]: young leaves and mature leaves,
but predominantly expressed and increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: expression during seed development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, what we did this time,
because this potential substrate is made
[SPEAKER_00]: in yeast, we fed this substrate the
linoleic acid and we could see that when
[SPEAKER_00]: we then add that with this vector
expressing the gene that we actually then
[SPEAKER_00]: get accumulate, we get accumulation of the
18-3 N3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's then good evidence and these
different variations of empty vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added GLA and found that we were
able to then also desaturate gamma
[SPEAKER_00]: linoleic acid to the stereodonic acid,
so 18-4 N3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that then I hope demonstrates to you
that we've indeed got this gene that is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing 18-2 and we've also got this
gene which is producing 18-3 from linoleic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid and 18-4 from gamma linoleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that then is great evidence that if
we could knock out those genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't it be really cool because then we
could basically introduce a block here and
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce a block here and then we could
play around with cross signals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before we had gene editing going
and also this is now really a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of traditional ways to do plant breeding
in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s where you just
[SPEAKER_00]: used a mutagen and introduced lots and
lots of mutations into the genome and then
[SPEAKER_00]: look for often using forward genetics,
of course, just screen to get a trait of
[SPEAKER_00]: change and a trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, what we're doing is
reverse genetics where we use this
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called tilling approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't get into the nitty gritty details
of it, but essentially this is now using
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular biology where we can find
[SPEAKER_00]: heteroduplex formation when we mix a
combination of seeds from different
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a mutation in a gene in one
individual, then when we melt that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: that's mixed from a number of individuals,
we can then find a mutation because first
[SPEAKER_00]: of all, you will get pairing of a mutated
gene sequence and a wild type gene
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence to form a heteroduplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use this enzyme cell worm
which basically cuts DNA wherever you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a heteroduplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this enzyme comes from celery
which is why it's called cell worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically that allows us then to
just using gels, using polyacrylate
[SPEAKER_00]: acrylamide gels, in fact, is how we did
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found mutations in genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the power of this approach as well is
especially when you're working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dioecious species such as hemp,
in this case, phenola, it allows you to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify mutations in the heterozygous
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though they're recessive
mutations, you can identify them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous state, which is almost a
prerequisite for us because it was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult, still is really,
really difficult to self M worm plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis
which caused GC to AT transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we generated a mutagenized population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically the way that we crossed that
then any mutations we had were gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the M2 seeds, and then we did
screening essentially the way I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna dwell on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we got the mutagen dose right,
this proved really, really productive for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it allowed us to identify
this so-called heteroduplex mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about 60 mutations in two gene
targets because the molecular biology then
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to amplify specific gene
targets and do the heteroduplex mapping on
[SPEAKER_00]: those gene targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we followed up 15 of those mutations
by phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five of those showed marked changes of
fatty acid profile, which is again,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus we took those forward into
mutation breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summary, we had three mutations in that
Delta 12 gene that I showed you the
[SPEAKER_00]: function of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I summarized here what these do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these really interesting,
sorry, these really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had stop codons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're looking for knockout
mutations, you really like stop codons
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also got other interesting,
this is a proline to leucine transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And proline, which is a really powerful
amino acid in terms of impacting on
[SPEAKER_00]: protein function, because it's responsible
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those proline kinks are really powerful
mutations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got a really nice range of
mutations across these two genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this was described 10 years
ago in this Balika et al paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we did experimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is then the work program that we
followed where we had gene target
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery and validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeping an eye on the clock here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did lots of screening,
as I've just shown you, selected promising
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did breeding and back
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to dwell on this because
you're all experts in breeding in Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we took this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, because, of course,
this is a dioecious species, we ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in crossing because we could track
the gene and the heterozygous state
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have nice molecular markers for
these mutations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then ultimately took them through to
back cross four and then crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous siblings to get homozygous back
cross four MHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we then, and one of the nice things we
were able to do as well in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping is we could just cut off one
of the cotyledons, one of the first leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: from the seed and do fatty acid profiling
at the same time as doing molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then just to quickly show you then,
I wouldn't be telling you all this if we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have really nice phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you knock out this Delta-15
desaturase, you expect to see an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in linoleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would expect it to be a recessive
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black bars here are the homozygous
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this elevation in linoleic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this decrease in 183N3 in the
homozygous state compared to wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heterozygous, in fact,
is intermediary in a lot of the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't think I need to say
anything more about that impressive
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's even more impressive is when
you knock out this Delta-12 desaturase
[SPEAKER_00]: with either of these two different
mutations, which we talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you see here depicted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this stop codon is really nice and
powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get nearly a transition from about 10%
to almost 80% oleic acid with this single
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This single mutation in that gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we've focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we have done field trials and
taken this through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you had mentioned, Lucia,
this is what we registered in the UK as a
[SPEAKER_00]: UK variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly then, in that high
oleic line, there's really high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fatty acid in the triacylglycerol,
the seed oil, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is reassuring compared to the wild
type where there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really interestingly,
things like hexanols, which are some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those molecules that give you the rancid
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when you look at the phenola wild
type seed oil, this is in head space
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of the seed oil compared to the
high oleic variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this is more or less
flatlining, whereas these hexanols are
[SPEAKER_00]: really increasing in wild type phenola
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as further evidence of what's
happening in terms of volatiles being
[SPEAKER_00]: emitted when you crush the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, there's elevated levels of
tocopherols in the CNAP 1808, the high
[SPEAKER_00]: oleic variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these antioxidants are present in
seed, obviously to protect the,
[SPEAKER_00]: well not obviously, but assume because
they're protecting the fatty acids from
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have polyunsaturated
fatty acids in the CNAP 1808, maybe these
[SPEAKER_00]: tocopherols aren't being used up and
there's just more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just another interesting
statistically robust trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps most interesting is that we do
this sort of industry standard ransomat
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we just focus on the standard hemp
and the CNAP 1808, and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: projected stability in months of the oil
at three different temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 degrees, four degrees and zero degrees,
you can see this significant increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 20 degrees, it goes up to 10 months
compared to two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at four degrees, it's going from four
months to 29 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, and this is basically
getting similar then to olive oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, we're now doing a whole
range of industry related food standards
[SPEAKER_00]: for this hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it behaves very, very similar to olive
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it very, very interesting
for a much wider market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got patent protection of this in the US
for that particular allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have plant breeder's rights in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have been working with partners in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gone into the list of approved
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put this in, which is taken
from the Canadian government website,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they record where across all the
different states in Canada, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties, there's other
varieties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is fanola, which is one of the
most popular varieties in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's grown across all these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this reflects that in Manitoba,
they were trialing CNAP 1808 in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they continue to be interested in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it performs pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It performs very similarly to fanola,
in fact, in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to mention, if I can,
this is my last trait that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is one of those Delta 15,
sorry, this is one of the older Delta 12
[SPEAKER_00]: desaturase mutations, which we found for
some unknown reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as well as producing what it does,
is it elevates the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: gamma-linolenic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, it's not amazing,
but it takes it up to about 7% from 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may have something to do with the
way that this desaturase works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't managed to separate this
phenotype from this point mutation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: desaturase, the Delta 12 desaturase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we did was we combined that
mutation with the Delta 15 desaturase
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've managed to take the levels of
gamma-linolenic acid up to about 11%,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, as you know, when I mentioned,
is getting much more interesting in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of a new GLA variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in the process of trying to get
variety registration for this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think this can be very,
very significant commercially as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not borage, as I said, which is 24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you compare the yields that you
get for the hemp crop compared to borage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a really challenging crop to
grow, then per hectare, it can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting there in terms of production of
GLA per hectare compared to borage,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the range of varieties that
I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I've convinced you that you can
really do reverse genetics and get some
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice, interesting nutrients out of
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty more could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you could now use gene editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, a lot of people still don't
want to be doing gene editing,
[SPEAKER_00]: even with the technical challenges,
but also the regulatory and public
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptance challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is still a nice way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still a huge advocate for gene editing
and GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would use it every time if I had a
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just pointing out that this route is
still very, very broad public acceptance
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world that we've been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilo has really led this for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monica was the postdoc at the time who was
really on this project, along with these
[SPEAKER_00]: other wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had funding from EU and from the
Garfield Weston Foundation Charity and
[SPEAKER_00]: from other bits and pieces that I've got
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think with that, I'm very happy
to stop and take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've just been running about 40
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll stop sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some questions in our Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we're going to have a couple more
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the first question I see is,
do you think we can increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: oil apart from modifying the proportions
of the fatty acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different ways you can increase
the amount of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, if you just consider the amount
of oil as yield per hectare, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the amount of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can increase the size of the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with oil crops, that ratio of oil
to protein in the seed is much more fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: and harder to do anything with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the increasing the amount of oil is,
I think, in terms of what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, is now looking at more
conventional breeding programs to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: oil yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, that have got larger seed
size than the phenola variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's various ways you can go
about doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that answers that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all anonymous attendees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can change in fatty acid composition have
negative effects on seed germination?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, is the clear answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done quite a bit on this in the past
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I started my lab,
the first thing I worked on was seed
[SPEAKER_00]: germination and fatty acid composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the 90s, in fact, there was a
really interesting program that was funded
[SPEAKER_00]: by a company called or worked on by a
company called Calgene in California and
[SPEAKER_00]: then by Monsanto, where they actually made
C12 lauric acid in Arabidopsis and in
[SPEAKER_00]: canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really, really different
fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some challenges with that
in terms of using it, because basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens when you germinate seeds is,
of course, the fatty acids are converted
[SPEAKER_00]: into sugars and used to fuel growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with all of these fatty acids,
the enzymes involved in fatty acid beta
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidation can cope with all of these
different fatty acids quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that conversion to sugar is not
inhibited by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see any impact on any of
these on seed germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and Daniela, that variety you
registered, where has it been grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of it has been grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I showed you very quickly
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really just getting it's just
getting traction now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed you that that screenshot from
that government website in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows well in Canada, it grows well
and up there in those higher latitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even further north than upstate New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my bad sense of humor there
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so it's at that stage where
we're really interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got huge potential because
this trait of hyaluronic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's now been introduced into
soybean, sunflower, corn, and canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And industry love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the food industry love the trait
because, you know, you can fry with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: use it in food processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think hemp oil has got all their
advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got a really nice nutty
flavor and it's got a really, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: good for low impact farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as I say, my ambition is to
really use this trait to get that much
[SPEAKER_00]: better adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often industrial hemp and by farmers as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so I hope that answers your
question, Daniella.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another anonymous attendee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is oil from this variety being sold in the
UK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet, but I hope it will be soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there seed oil traits or compositions
that could be used as proxies for
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication syndrome across different
hemp or cannabis varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I, what, I'm now, because I'm not
really a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pretending I'm one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what on earth is domestication
syndrome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me, Lucia, you're a plant
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any exam question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's referring to all those
different traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, that they lose or they
shatter less or that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the other traits that you need to
facilitate domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so because, you know,
pod shattering or seed dropping and
[SPEAKER_00]: dormancy are all regulated by different
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genes are really, really,
really specific to fatty acid composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the best fatty acid profile
for sustainable aviation fuel?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably, yeah, I won't start
making any jokes about who might be asking
[SPEAKER_00]: that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, okay, the best fatty acid
composition for sustainable aviation fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: is more like C8 than C10 fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much shorter chain fatty acids than
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't, I really wouldn't go near
an aeroplane with polyunsaturated fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acids because, you know, the whole
aviation fuel, the oxygen is there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and desaturation is their enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so C, and people, I think you
know that I mentioned lauric acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: C12 and C10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was played around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an away, you would want really,
really high yielding crop to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: aviation fuel and be competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with industrial hemp, you're
looking at more at a higher value end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market than aviation fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you observe any change in the protein
concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the either composition or composition
and as I mentioned, because the fatty acid
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of hemp protein is very
interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it commercially available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the process of commercializing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Danielle isn't giving up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, speaking of screening genetically
diverse germplasm for unusual oil
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Zachary is asking about looking at
germplasm for unusual oil profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good question, Zachary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done much of that because we
haven't really had access to a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, there isn't really a
huge, you know, diverse germplasm of
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've looked at a few,
but we haven't seen anything come out that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a different fatty acid
composition in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't spotted anything, in fact,
that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last question from Joy
Beckerman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any general claims that are made re-hemp
seed oil, the most prevalent being that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a perfect ratio of omega 3 to 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: How accurate is such a statement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if one should apply a qualification to
it, generally speaking, most varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a perfect ratio of omega 3 to 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the most appropriate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good question, Joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a nutritionist and I would never
assume that I was qualified to state
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the ideal omega 3 to 6 composition
because I think it depends on who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking to, to a significant extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I will say is that, you know,
that ratio that you see in hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: in traditional hemp, if I would call it,
and all of the varieties that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's pretty much fixed with that
low amount of GLA and much higher amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of ALA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could see that GLA and
stearidonic acid are very low,
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five percent, and ALA is much
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, there are applications
where people like that ratio of omega 6 to
[SPEAKER_00]: omega 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, there is also an industry
need for ALA on its own or GLA on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, if I could go back,
that's why I'm quite excited about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prospect of developing a variety which is
not making ALA but is making significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of GLA because when you take those
two oils and try and separate them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: factory, it's quite difficult to separate
ALA and GLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you produce a variety which is
just making GLA and linoleic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: then for the processing of that oil,
it's much easier to get pure GLA out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So industry often have requirements for
that downstream processing that are
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting targets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the end user targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trivializing the question at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's, you know, it's a very
good question and it depends on who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to and what nutritionist you're
talking to.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about increasing lysine from Andrea
Herman?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I haven't really focused on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is that what I've read is that,
you know, the ratio was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another job to increase lysine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing compounds like that,
you really need to upregulate biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: of them and that becomes a whole other
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another challenge where you really do
need to start thinking about doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you could forward screen and see if
you could do it, but upregulating genes by
[SPEAKER_00]: gene editing or GMO would be the way to go
if you want to increase lysine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got to the end of the list,
the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Ian, for your fantastic
talk and thank you for answering all our
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've recorded the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to upload it to our SIPS
YouTube channel in the coming days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for connecting today and
see you in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, Ian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a nice rest of your week.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
