[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to talk about
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I start, thank you,
Joan, for the introduction, and thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: all for coming for this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as this picture indicates,
I'm going to cover a lot of ground today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about not a part,
but most of my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try and attempt to do
that in the next 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should start my timer.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a lot of projects being
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give you a bird's eye
view of the different projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to know more in detail,
I'd be happy to talk about that later
[SPEAKER_00]: today or anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into the research part,
I'd like to thank or acknowledge a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have helped us with the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with people in my lab,
postdocs, lab techs, grad students,
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrads, RU students, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of what I'm going to show is actually
done by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all credit goes to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had the fortune of having a number
of collaborators in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should use maybe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of collaborators in plant biology,
in SIPs, in Cornell, and outside of SIPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as outside of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate and acknowledge their
guidance and help in all our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to Frank Schroeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Frank Schroeder at BTI, he let us use
his mass spec for the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done thousands, if not low,
tens of thousands of samples on the mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every morning when I wake up,
I pray to the longevity and safety of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, a lot of data generated using
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the funding agencies that
have funded all of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my lab works on plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, I like this topic because
it is at the interface of both basic and
[SPEAKER_00]: applied research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants make a lot of natural products,
which we use in our daily lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't make it for us to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make it for their own use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the diverse roles of these
metabolites, not only does it satisfy my
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual curiosity, it also,
for plants, it produces a huge number of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce a huge number of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimated that across the plant
kingdom, there were a million metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And individual plants produce thousands of
metabolites in different organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This diversity is because of the
complexity of the underlying metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have barely scratched the surface of
both the metabolome as well as the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: networks that produce this diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my lab has been focused over
the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there are a number of
projects, we classified them into three
[SPEAKER_00]: major types.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, figuring out what is the
scale of this diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this diversity produced at the
evolutionary and biochemical level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we use it for our own
purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with a number of models.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about some of them in
this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next few slides are organized in
this manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about the three areas and then
end with just one slide on summary and
[SPEAKER_00]: future plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of the areas also contain what we are
currently working on, starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as I said, we do a lot of mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomics, but there are some
challenges associated with metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is that the name itself is a
misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do metabolomics, we are doing
basically metabolite profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do transcriptomics, you are
getting most of the transcriptome
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed at that given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in metabolomics, because there are so
many diverse chemical structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this compound which has a lot of
hydroxyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these carotenoids do not have anything
that will allow it to solubilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long hydrocarbon chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the type of extraction solvent you
use will determine what sort of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: will be extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they have to move in an
electromagnetic field to get ionized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of mass spec you use,
the parameters you said, the masses you
[SPEAKER_00]: said will define what sort of compounds
you detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the type of column chemistry you
use will also determine how well you are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to separate those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first challenge here is when you
are sampling the metabolome, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting only a small part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you get a small part of it,
when it comes to annotation, less than 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the peaks can be annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In transcriptomics, when you have a gene
sequencing, Sanger sequence, you can blast
[SPEAKER_00]: it against NCBI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have some information about
what that gene does, looking at it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about this 95% of the metabolome
for which you don't know anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we tried to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been trying to work on,
as part of our research, looking at if we
[SPEAKER_00]: know the fragmentation pattern of these
metabolites, can we get better insights
[SPEAKER_00]: into this 95%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you this case study of
resin glycosides, which are structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals produced in convalescent species
that include sweet potatoes and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural important crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resin glycosides comprise of this
oligosaccharide chain, to which you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these acyl chains attached, and this long
C16 fatty acid with hydroxyl chain
[SPEAKER_00]: attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of variations upon this
basic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These compounds are important against
various insects and nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they also have medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we figured out was there is some
pattern in how these compounds fragment in
[SPEAKER_00]: a mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: The masses, these can change a little bit,
but we can predict what sort of masses
[SPEAKER_00]: they might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you computationally dig into the
mass spec data, can we recover more
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Lars and Ali did in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking at 30 different species
of the convalescent family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can ignore all of the structural
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to extract a lot of features
from the mass spec data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This first column is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows how many resin glycosides were
discovered in each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just to give you some context,
since 1992, when these compounds were
[SPEAKER_00]: first discovered, there were about 300
resin glycosides known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in one species itself, we can find
over 330 resin glycosides using
[SPEAKER_00]: computational analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get a lot of structural
information of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using this analysis, we are able to
make better sense of the metabolites that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist in the metabolome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now initially, we were doing this in a
very stepwise manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to click on each peak in the mass
spec data and then look at it manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we started writing some Python
scripts to dig into the files.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also a little faster,
but still slow enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, Vishwa, who is now a first-year
plant biology student in Claire Castille's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, he developed this website where you
can just now upload the mass spec data
[SPEAKER_00]: files, and within a couple of seconds,
you're able to get all the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this simplifies the workflow quite a
bit in our analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what sort of biological information
can this diversity reveal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this is called a MSMS molecular
network of all the resin glycosides we
[SPEAKER_00]: could detect across all species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green color indicates the resin
glycosides found in convolvulus genus
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purple ones are those found in
epomia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see the
diversification that has occurred between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two genera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That speaks to some biochemical diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have the structure information,
we can see what sort of pattern exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in epomia species, we see low
molecular weight resin glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: In convolvulus, we see high molecular
weight resin glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see the acyl chains that are
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to dig into these aspects
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this also enabled us actually to
select some species for RNA-seq,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know the tissue-specific
differential patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Baswati, who is a grad student in the
lab, is looking at different accessions of
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet potato, because these are connected
with nematode defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's trying to figure out how the
diversity of resin glycosides vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Irfan, a postdoc in the lab,
is looking at the biosynthesis of these
[SPEAKER_00]: resin glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P450s, BHDs, glycosyl transferases that
are involved in resin glycoside
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can engineer them in other plants
that do not have these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what these results show is that if we
know the MSMS fragmentation pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can make a lot more sense out of the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shown this for other metabolic
classes, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins and flavonoids in different
colored sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then acyl sugars, insulin and
habrokites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about this story in
a few slides later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have MSMS fragmentation knowledge,
we can apply it to get more compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if you don't know what the
fragmentation patterns are, or if the
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns are not consistent?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tried to analyze, champion two
types of methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, identification-free analysis,
which is basically multivariate
[SPEAKER_00]: statistical methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then instead of specific compounds,
we can look at compound classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, how are flavonoids
changing under stress, or how are
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleosides changing, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done by Liz, who was a
biology student, now a postdoc at MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was working on Brachypodium in
collaboration with Olena's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Maria Harrison's lab, and Joint Genome
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew Brachypodium under different
conditions, environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are hydroponic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were grown in some special sand-soil
mixture from where we could isolate roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were grown in regular soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal was to get RNA-seq and
metabolomic data and establish some
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations to predict gene function or
annotate gene function better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did some preliminary processing
with this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just show you a couple of
this whole paper is like 30 supplementary
[SPEAKER_00]: files with nine figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just going to show you two figures
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is diversity and specialization,
which are basically metrics derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological theory or actually information
theory, which diversity implies how
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse a given metabolome is in terms of
the representation and diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many peaks are there, how many
relative abundance of different peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see leaves are much more diverse
than roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also saw that roots are more
responsive to different stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that specialization, this is roots
grown in a specific hydroponic condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we apply heat stress,
the metabolome becomes much more special.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many more unique metabolites
that show up under heat stress in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, which does not occur that much in
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another representation of the same
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing a metric called RDPI,
or relative stress plasticity index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically measures how much the
entire metabolome is changing up and down
[SPEAKER_00]: together combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is it changing in response to a
given condition compared to the control?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first five columns are the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next five columns are the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing for the transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves don't change much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the metabolome doesn't change
much under the different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But roots, it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, when plants were grown
under heat stress, the metabolome changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one day of heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for one week before the heat stress,
if they were grown under copper deficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, it did not change as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected two stresses to have a lot
more change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow the no copper buffers the
change in the metabolome as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this doesn't have any phenotypic
change, we did some experiments with Olena
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are interested, we'll talk
about that at the end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, looking at structural classes,
we use this method called Canopus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which instead of predicting from a mass
spectrum, this is acid, no cell methanine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will give these classes of metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see, OK, we can take all
the deoxyribonucleoside and see how that
[SPEAKER_00]: entire class is changing under the given
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of this method is instead of
5% of the metabolic features that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: identify using traditional approaches,
we can go to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we could go to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we removed a lot of predictions
after extensive quality analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a significant bump in how
much you can analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing the different classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is showing the different classes of
metabolites and, again, RDPI on the
[SPEAKER_00]: y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first five are, again,
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next five columns are root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like you to focus your attention
on just these two panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, what we found out was flavonoids
were highly perturbed in the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the leaves under all
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then furonoid lignans were highly
perturbed under heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives us some hypotheses and
models to start digging into the data and
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with RNA-seq, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see flavonoids also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The enzymes also were significantly
down-regulated in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ongoing work, we are focusing a lot
on how do we get better annotation for the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to throw away 95% of the
data or even 60% of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in collaboration with various
researchers across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to develop an ontology system
for metabolomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like gene ontology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do a lot more deeper analysis
into suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, we got funded for
International Center for Plant Resilience
[SPEAKER_00]: based out of MSU.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it involves several institutions in
the US as well as researchers across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this center is to not only
find out new chemicals from plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: for agrochemical use, but also find out
the genes involved in that pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer those pathways in yeast and
plants, et cetera, and then test those in
[SPEAKER_00]: field settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be an exciting project
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to shift from the metabolome
to the genetic aspect of our research and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about how this diversity evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, at the enzyme level, and second,
zooming out again at a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for looking at enzymes, these are the
contributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the main drivers of metabolic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus on an enzyme family called BHD,
S-A transferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this enzyme, HCT, which is a BHD,
does a simple reaction of transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: this fumaril group to a hydroxyl or an
amine group on the acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the reaction is very simple,
but BHDs use a variety of different
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are aromatic alcohols,
aliphatic alcohols.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are amines, aromatic amines,
and more complex structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these are involved in a variety
of different processes in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: from reproduction, growth, development,
stress response, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding how BHDs have come to use
these substrate types, that's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we started off this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to know here that BHDs do not
exist across all living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are even in algae, they are present
in only one to two copies in the algal
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have expanded significantly in
land plants, dozens and hundreds of copies
[SPEAKER_00]: in each genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that in uniprot, there are
only 55 BHDs with activities that are
[SPEAKER_00]: deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are 100 BHDs in tomato alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you a scale of how much gap
there is between what is annotated,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is there in databases, versus what we
need to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not surprising because we
found out a couple of years ago there were
[SPEAKER_00]: only two people in uniprot doing plant
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not just curators looking at
enzyme papers or metabolism papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across all plants, only two people reading
all the thousands of papers published
[SPEAKER_00]: every week and putting them in uniprot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is obviously a major constraint
for a lot of different downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to give them a helping hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least for BHDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lars, a postdoc in the lab,
he read 100 odd papers and collected 101
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemically characterized buds,
171 substrates of these buds, and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into 11 different structural classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use a lot of structural classes as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to take a step back and think
about how much effort this must have taken
[SPEAKER_00]: for Lars, it's a boring job reading papers
and putting everything in an Excel file
[SPEAKER_00]: one by one, making sure everything is
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that paper was published in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate, who is now a first-year plant-based
student, came into the picture last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he started doing this job too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got bored too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had two undergrads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, we can pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, no, keep your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a boring job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate started thinking about more
innovative approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked, what if we could use
ChartGPT to read papers instead of any
[SPEAKER_00]: humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, no, we can take away the jobs
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he came up with this pipeline called
AutoNate, which enables the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually wanted to call it AutoNate,
but Nate went the more professional route
[SPEAKER_00]: and called it FunFetch, which is a much
better professional name than AutoNate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, this pipeline reads
through a bunch of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screens through thousands of abstracts
published in PubMed and then selects a
[SPEAKER_00]: small set of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: From each of those papers, it extracts out
the enzyme activity, the enzyme name,
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme substrate information, species
information, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we curate it manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of time for Lars to do just
the PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using this pipeline, we illuminated a
lot of enzymes using this pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to screen through 27,000
abstracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is too dark, but the previous
lighting was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screened through 27,000 abstracts very
quickly with a cost of $65, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for $5,000, 5,500 papers,
we extracted a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes, like the DOI, journal name,
species name, enzyme ID and bank ID,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all of these 5,500 papers,
it costs about $300 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, actually, a little more,
I think $1,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from this, we extracted 32,000 rows of
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these were hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is after filtering for
hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can talk about that interesting bit
later if you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are under active curation right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a sense of how much
improvement this makes, we curated this
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily for PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we submitted the activities to three
different databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Uniprot itself, from 55, this goes to
250.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a five-fold jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take the curated activities and put
it into databases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can trust what goes into Uniprot
now, because at least two and mostly three
[SPEAKER_00]: people have looked at each entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Uniprot will also look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we use these compiled activities
for uncovering new biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we can do evolutionary analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the 200 and one
biochemically characterized PhDs that Lars
[SPEAKER_00]: had expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of the concentric circles here is
one of those 11 substrate classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this clade uses aromatic
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This clade uses anthocyanins and flavonoid
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could define eight clades based on the
bootstrap values.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least eight, but there are many more
which are not represented in this figure
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are uncharacterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can also go back and see how
activities have evolved through their
[SPEAKER_00]: expansion in land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, we need to know what is the
ancestral activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the colors on the branches indicates
how far back the orthologous group of that
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme is conserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is orange, it means the
orthologous group is conserved in
[SPEAKER_00]: angiosperms, gymnosperms, mosses,
liverworts, in all of land plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's blue, purple, it means it's only
present in dicots and angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know these three substrate classes,
the ability to acylate these three
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate classes, existed in all of land
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because this is
involved in lignin biosynthesis mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is involved in waxy ester
biosynthesis and polyamine acylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three features are important for the
conquest of land, for terrestrialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so PhDs played an important role in
that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also then know this particular
clade is a new activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came only in, it existed promiscuously
for a long time, for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got fixed in the gene pool only in
angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did motif analysis to figure out
what is special about these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This clade comes out that there is a strip
of fan which is unique in this clades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing side-directed mutagenesis,
we showed that both of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tryptophan is much more important for
activity than the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborated with Divakar Shukla's lab
at Urbana-Champaign who did molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically they showed that the
tryptophan, it holds the anthocyanin in
[SPEAKER_00]: place for the catalysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the histidine is a catalytic site,
the residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tryptophan holds the anthocyanin
in place through PIPA interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the tryptophan is gone, the anthocyanin
wobbles around in the active site and
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no acylation that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cysteine is gone, the tryptophan
also wobbles by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the anthocyanin also wobbles and there
is no activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of the enzymes in that clade,
you see tryptophan and cysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was important for the evolution
of that activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are focusing on two different
clades, two different clades in these
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is this very long disordered region
that's present only in the lignin
[SPEAKER_00]: acylating enzymes and nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shown that there is some selective
pressure maintaining this as flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've changed this to a rigid region by
doing side-directed mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It increases the specificity of this
enzyme towards native substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're digging into that phenotype further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going into the broader scale of
how do we predict the activities of
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make protein function
prediction better?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ping Chen is a first-year plant
breeding student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is looking at AI models as well as
phylogenetic-based prediction of function
[SPEAKER_00]: in enzyme families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Xin Yu is a postdoc in the lab
who is looking at validating these
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions using traditional approaches
like wigs, enzyme assays, as well as using
[SPEAKER_00]: some synthetic biology techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to zoom out into a broader
scale of geographical evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, again, the model system is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm going to talk about soinum
habrocytes, which is a wild tomato that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows in Peru and Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: This produces aces sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aces sugars are like resin glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a sucrose core where different
aces chains are attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're produced from this one tiny
cell on top of the leaf and stem surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes the surface of the leaf very
sticky, so insects don't like to lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts like a water barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In different populations of soinum
habrocytes, the aces sugar profiles are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tomato, there are only 10 or so aces
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in soinum habrocytes, there are a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different between different
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rob Lass Lab, back 12 years ago,
actually, 2012, they had looked at 55
[SPEAKER_00]: different accessions of soinum habrocytes
spread across the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found two major chemotypic
clusters for this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found out that this enzyme is mutated
in some of these accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this acetyl group is missing in the
aces sugar in one of these, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: super-clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's missing this acetyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that was mapped out on the species,
on the locations of these accessions from
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were collected, all of the
inactivations were above this line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these populations are inactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the most interesting part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting part is that the losses
occurred by three different means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the gene is present, but there is no
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there's a frameshift that causes
function inactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene is expressed, but there is
frameshift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we cannot even detect the aces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three different means of the same
enzyme getting lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that possible, and what's special
about this line?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started working on this project,
the idea was very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to figure out where this species
originated, how it has moved across the
[SPEAKER_00]: range, and then see how these chemotypes
evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, I did grad sequencing of 50
southern Hippocrates accessions and four
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Penelia accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I came here, I started analyzing
this data along with Jacob Landis,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is in plant biology in the Spect and
Doyle Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He helped with the population genomic
analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at the genotypic level,
we found two different super-clusters,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, bordering around this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent a lot of time figuring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ashamed to say that after five years
of working on this project, suddenly it
[SPEAKER_00]: clicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what clicked was looking at the
geography of this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out that the backdrop, the
geography, the ecology had a very
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is occurring in the backdrop
of this Andes mountain range, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a huge wall of rock that emerges on
the South American coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no east-west movements of
species possible because of this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: voice, like very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some parts, like this
Huanca-Bamba depression, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: depressions, where species can move
east-west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this region that I showed with the two
genotypic clusters, super-clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, two hemotypic super-clusters
happening, that's happening in this region
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Huanca-Bamba zone, which is
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the depressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this region, there are so many small
habitats, micro-habitats, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: region has been influenced by tectonic
activity, volcanic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Ocean has come in, gone out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are riverine beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather patterns are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many micro-habitats that
one-sixth of all plant species are found
[SPEAKER_00]: in tropical Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those are, many of those are due
to the endemism present in the ASE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where all of the chemical and
genotypic evolution is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue dots are southern hybridites on
the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the southern part of the range,
it just is on the western slopes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Andes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very dry region with hardly any
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's sneaked into the Andes,
and it goes up north to Ecuador,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is very wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different co-evolutionary
processes happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's sneaked in is the southern
boundary of the Huanca-Bamba zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it sneaks in, and this is
where we see all the inactivations
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Huanca-Bamba depression is where
we see the super-clusters being separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power of this super-cluster,
the geographical isolation is so high that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the south, we see isolation by
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you typically see.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the population moves farther out,
there is less genetic exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is less gene flow happening
because of distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the north, even though populations
are very close to each other, like Itaca
[SPEAKER_00]: and Portland, they are very close to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, there is no genetic flow
occurring because of the geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two clusters, population
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they are very close to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But genetically, this is the FSD,
fixation index tree, which shows how much
[SPEAKER_00]: is the gene flow occurring between
different populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two clusters here are separated by
the Huanca-Bamba depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very little gene flow occurring
between these two clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might see here that I have written
SCSC here because when there is
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical isolation, the species is an
ancestrally self-incompatible species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because if there is no gene flow
occurring, and the plant finds itself
[SPEAKER_00]: without any other self-incompatible
species or members, then it's going to die
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a huge selection pressure for
evolution of self-compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to geography, genotype,
chemical evolution, that's another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that has happened in this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with Pat Bedinger at Colorado
State, who has been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: self-compatibility in this species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that north of the
Huanca-Bamba zone, SC has emerged from SI
[SPEAKER_00]: five times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The south, it has emerged just once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two SI-related genes have been mutated
several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: North of the range, causing five
independent emerges of self-compatibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: likely because of this geographical
isolation of these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also see all the activations of
acetylated acetyl sugars of acetyl-4 up in
[SPEAKER_00]: north of the southern boundary of the AZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you'll just have to trust my
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we showed here was the five
different chemotypic superclasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemotypic clusters in acetyl sugars that
we saw correlate very well with which kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of self-compatibility group it belonged
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it so happened that here we have mixed
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here MPs, mixed populations,
which means the self-compatibility alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, but in heterozygous states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have just come about in the
geographically acid populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they went up, the populations got
fixed in different corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they went into homozygosity,
they may have pulled out the associated
[SPEAKER_00]: ASAT-4 alleles along with them,
resulting in those chemotypic clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very much an example of a
founder effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see changes at the genetic,
if you see some transcript is heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed, or you see difference in the
metabolome profiles of two individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see some patterns, you might be
tempted to think that this is to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some adaptive significance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is happening just because there's
no other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just happening with a genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: One individual got fixed in the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should always be thought of as a
null hypothesis, genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_00]: and adaptation should be tested against
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a very clear evidence,
in my mind at least, although we could not
[SPEAKER_00]: prove any of this, but I think it's
happening because of founder effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this paper, we talked about the model
for sonohabrokeitis population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It emerged over here, and there are two
branches that moved north and south,
[SPEAKER_00]: and went through all the hemotypic,
genetic, reproductive diversification as
[SPEAKER_00]: it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now I'm going to shift gears
and talk about how all of this metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and diversification and our
understanding of the genes can be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: for improvement of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on sweet potatoes as one of
the major projects in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might wonder why sweet potatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sweet potatoes is not really grown
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 200 acres of sweet potato grown in
New York, and most of the biggest grower
[SPEAKER_00]: in North Carolina, as well as some
southern states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a warm weather crop, needs a lot of
time for maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has been a lot of interest in
various northern states to grow sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, including Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to grow sweet potatoes,
but this is always surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew sweet potatoes for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plot was in Geneva, and one plot was
near Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing the years from the two
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were started at the same time from
the same stock, and one grew like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: another grew like fingerlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for another variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second year, it was flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spoke to the extension person who
was helping us with this, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow from one hill to another hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why growers don't like to grow
sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow it in one corner of the plot,
because there is so much variation in root
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is an incentive to grow in this
because of organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can command a premium price.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no natural pests of sweet potato
in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sweet potato is a huge biomass crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use it for extracting dyes,
colors, health foods, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big industry in the
Northeast for health foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our intent in working with
sweet potatoes under colors, how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use it for these purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the main bottlenecks in this
process is how do we make the root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: more resilient to environmental change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a project we just started a
couple of years ago, so I don't have great
[SPEAKER_00]: results on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have been exploring the use of
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the resilience, as well as
figuring out the genetic basis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress resistance and resilience and
root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an experiment that Irfan did last
year, where he grew sweet potatoes under
[SPEAKER_00]: three different water stress conditions,
as well as under AMF and no AMF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the water stress has a lot
of effect on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even between AMF and no AMF,
you can see for this variety, the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is much better in AMF conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the root weight we did a lot of
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root weight was also significantly
better immediately after the stress if
[SPEAKER_00]: they were given AMF condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some possibility of using
AMFs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did metabolomic and transcriptomic
sampling under all of these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are analyzing that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project on the application side is
looking at how we can engineer crops to
[SPEAKER_00]: make novel bioactive compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we are using tomato as a model.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomato fruit develops quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are different varieties which
grow to different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chenu is working on taking the terpenoid
flux that goes into making this red color
[SPEAKER_00]: lycopene and diverting it to making drugs
which are based on the terpenoid scaffold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might have instead of purple
tomatoes, we can have tomatoes making
[SPEAKER_00]: these pharmaceutical compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the research that we are doing
in the lab, to summarize my talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about how illuminating the
metabolome is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the steps we are doing are taking on
that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discovering enzyme function is one of the
major areas in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we are collaborating with Arjun
Kakar's lab at Colorado State to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: novel symbiotes for functional validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another area of interest to me is
regulation of plant metabolism and how
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression evolves, or even how
different transcription factors control
[SPEAKER_00]: different metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we might work on in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering plant metabolism not only for
making these useful drugs, but also for
[SPEAKER_00]: stress resilience in sweet potatoes and
other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, discovering the genetic
networks and biochemical networks involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in stress resilience pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put out this slide again and take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is whether the FuncFetch
tool is extracting information from the
[SPEAKER_00]: papers or is it also generating new
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal of that pipeline is to just
extract information from the papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Nate discovered some very interesting
patterns of how it actually extracts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, it extracts out from
the paper itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes it goes into the references
and pulls out activities from the
[SPEAKER_00]: references, which normally you would miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not part of that paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also found that it hallucinates quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it pulls out information from
its training data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see a paper titled saying it's from
barley oats and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then them activities pulled out is a
human enzyme with bilirubin and
[SPEAKER_00]: testosterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going into a drug bank,
which is its training data and pulling out
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of the way we are extracting it
and organizing it, it's easy to fish out
[SPEAKER_00]: these hallucinations from our data set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, for tomato work in the
end, where you have the physical
[SPEAKER_02]: differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there opportunities or are some of the
collaborators here essentially growing
[SPEAKER_02]: them in different environments and seeing
if there are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we wrote a project with Andre
Kessler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, that was the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to do reciprocal transplants in
Peru and Ecuador and see if that has any
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive significance at the transcriptome
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And transcriptome, metabolome,
and the phenotype, actually, if there is
[SPEAKER_00]: any adaptive differences.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone noted morphological or other
differences between those two
[SPEAKER_01]: subpopulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are leaf differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are differences in the growth
habits.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about what is the kind
of brain that you take these things to
[SPEAKER_04]: evolve?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it thousand years or million years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if Jacob was here, he would have
been in a better position to answer this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to do some or get some
insights on the timescales for these
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't do that because of the
insufficient data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two species, the Penelia and Abrocyte,
is diverse about 3 million years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus or minus 2 million years from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it happened in the last million or so
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the selection pressure,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the traditional Bistrin
Betulera example, the wings of the
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies changing color because of the
Industrial Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things, those happened in a
couple of generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the selection pressure
and population size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know, in this case,
how much time it took.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some wireworm type insects or
nematodes that we see when we grow sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some holes inside the sweet
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rodents are the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come and eat the sweet potatoes quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, mostly because it is northern,
you don't see the traditional sweet potato
[SPEAKER_00]: where the usarium infections or the sweet
potato weevils are not found here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
