[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Esther Pullen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated in 2004 with a plant science
degree from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was in high school and college,
I didn't really know if I could do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with a degree in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew I loved working outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoyed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved my classes in agriculture when I
was at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to do something that would
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really meant something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've found in my years since I
graduated is that agriculture is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for so many things that go on
in the world today, from food to fiber to
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things have a basis in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it touches the lives of everyone in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've also found
is that in working for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies in the produce
industry and seeing people from across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of agriculture is that there are
many jobs in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are companies who are looking for
motivated, qualified individuals who have
[SPEAKER_00]: passion and experience in agriculture so
that they can make wonderful things
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in making a
difference and traveling the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing many new things, then a plant
sciences degree from Cornell would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way to start that.
