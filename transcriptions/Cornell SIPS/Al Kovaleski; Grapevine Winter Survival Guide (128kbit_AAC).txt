[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get straight into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the central region of New York,
we have grapevines that are cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: around the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of some special
characteristics of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here in this map that
you're seeing, this is the US VA Hardiness
[SPEAKER_00]: Zone map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in green where the area
with a milder climate extends from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Lakes further south because of the
Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is because of these characteristics
that we are able to cultivate grapevines
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vinifera kind around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that if you look at the
map of where we have wineries in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York, you see that they are located
where those green areas in the map to the
[SPEAKER_00]: left is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's climate characteristics that
become milder because of these large
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies of water that we see here in the
western part of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, there's some years where the
temperatures drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are studying cold hardiness in
grapes to try to understand what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics in the wild grapevines
that make them survive even further north
[SPEAKER_00]: from here and that the cultivated
grapevines are not that they don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, it's just to show you there's
different characteristics for each of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a combination of the geography and
the depth of the lakes and the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area of them that prevents them in most
winters from freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, they buffer
especially the low temperatures in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you might tell me, but global
warming, we're increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is your study relevant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need to understand cold
hardiness if we're not gonna need it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: near future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll tell you, here in these
maps, we see that the winter temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: are increasing and even the extremes in
temperature are going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically based on that the
low temperatures are rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the highs, but the low
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's still relevant is
because of this type of phenomenon that
[SPEAKER_00]: still is going to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polar vortexes that we've been seeing
with greater frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just because we came up with a
name for them, but they actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: increased in frequency lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as the air warms in the southern
regions, it decreases the strength of that
[SPEAKER_00]: jet stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, it's able to move
further south and then the Arctic air
[SPEAKER_00]: moves further south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still going to see low extremes
in temperature, even though the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures are milder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully by the end of this
presentation, you'll able to make your own
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions and because of how grapevines
are perceiving temperatures, they might
[SPEAKER_00]: still be affected by these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the seminar was titled Winter
Survival Guide, I decided to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: fight or flight responses in the
grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the sort of thing,
like a general grapevine that you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the late summer with the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that leaves the grapevine
are the fruit that we're picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the days become shorter and
the quality of light changes, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the dormancy established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get into fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those leaves are in the flight
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of that plant is still going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all the dormant structures
that have to resist the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about, especially
today what I'm going to talk about is how
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds of the plants are going to
survive the winter and how they respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that I'll be talking
about, endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is endodormancy?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a bud off of a plant and you
try to grow it very early in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: when it hasn't seen or felt any cold,
it's basically not going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here this cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not developing that bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not seeing bud break in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when they're endodormant,
you actually see the buds start to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare the sizes of the roots,
you'll see that this started growing much
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier than the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the transition from this endodorm
state, which is a non-responsive state,
[SPEAKER_00]: into an eco-dormant state, where if you
give enough temperatures, they'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, is understood as being a response
to chill accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants have a clock in which
they're counting how many hours they're
[SPEAKER_00]: standing in low temperatures, typically
calculated between 0 and 11 Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in that range, depending on what
model you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at the map for chilling
accumulation here in the US, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you go further north, you have
more chilling compared to the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the Midwest region,
you'll see that it actually has less
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling, or it's comparable to the
southern regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they spend so much time in
the below freezing temperatures during
[SPEAKER_00]: midwinter that they really don't
accumulate chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants don't count that into their
clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that in mid to high latitudes
is really where you have most of your
[SPEAKER_00]: chill accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you go further north,
you don't see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, just so you can see some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on the year also that
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a warm year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that here in New York and
Missouri, you're going to 1,600 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in South Dakota, you only get 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if we have a very cold winter,
like 2013, 2014, we actually have less
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling accumulated here in the New York
region, much closer to what South Dakota
[SPEAKER_00]: gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The responses of the plants fluctuate from
winter to winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also be talking a lot about
differential thermal analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or LTEs are the term that you're going to
hear me say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the analysis that we do to
evaluate the cold hardiness of these buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut them off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut them off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're careful to leave some of the bud
cushion, because this is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to still have this phenotype that
we're measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in these thermoelectric
modules that measure changes in voltage
[SPEAKER_00]: based on heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have these large plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put them in a programmable freezer,
which is going to lower the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: until minus 40 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get this record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the axis for temperature is
flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more negative temperatures are to
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that we see a high
temperature exotherm, or HTE, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: non-lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a low temperature
exotherm, which is where the buds are
[SPEAKER_00]: being killed by temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you see five peaks from five
different buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are able to record the
temperatures where these buds are killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is based on a super cooling ability
that the buds have inside of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water is actually able to drop
below its freezing point without forming
[SPEAKER_00]: ice crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you to understand what this
process is, I make these videos every
[SPEAKER_00]: single winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a ton of them to show what this
looks like, if you just look at water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see that that water is liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you shake it, it actually
crystallizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that water was super cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I shook it, it was actually
able to form the ice crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't completely freeze, because as
it's freezing, there's heat being
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only partially becoming solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure this throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that this curve has a
generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, I'm trying to get rid of that green
line that was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that this has a general U shape
that follows the air temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the bottom, you see the cold
hardiness for Cabernet Sauvignon and
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have what we think about as
three phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have an acclimation phase in which
the buds are gaining hardiness early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a maintenance phase in midwinter,
where they're not varying that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, they start losing
their hardiness, so they are deactivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see here that there is one
point where the air temperature actually
[SPEAKER_00]: goes below what the cold hardiness is for
those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is two points where it
gets very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see when we take those buds
from the field is that we actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: damage in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bud anatomy in Benifera is that you
have within a bud, it's a compound bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have three smaller buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary is the one that has the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one that's going to give you
the grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we see that peak exotherm or when
we see the temperature dropping below
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cold hardiness was, we see this
damage here, where there is a browning in
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary bud, whereas the secondary and
tertiary are still green in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant will still be able to grow
after this damage, but it won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers or grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this bud, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at two separate winters,
we see that they vary across winters in
[SPEAKER_00]: how they gain hardiness and how they lose
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's about a constant in the
maximum hardiness that they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get, which for a Benifera is about minus
25 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have temperatures constantly
dropping below that, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to cultivate Benifera grapevines,
which is where the ones we get most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: wine from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might say, it responds to
temperature, so why can't we predict this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, we can in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a model that was developed in
Washington State using field data,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it works very well for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we use this model to predict our
cold hardness, it doesn't do a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in green, you see our data points of
measured cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in orange, you'll see what the model
predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what we see is that there is an
over-prediction of hardiness in the
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation phase and an over-prediction
of hardiness in the deacclimation phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, the acclimation phase for
us is not that much of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the deacclimation,
here in the Northeast, our coldest
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of the year are really in the
last portion of the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have warm temperatures midwinter
and they start losing their hardiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very concerning that the model
doesn't predict that for us because of
[SPEAKER_00]: this shift in when the coldest
temperatures of the year are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the darkest colors are later in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to just test different
temperatures to see how they acclimated
[SPEAKER_00]: and just fix the rates that they were
given for each one of the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounded like a very simple idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took buds from the field,
and we made these single node cuttings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we exposed them to different
temperatures, 2, 4, 7, 11, and 22 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really expected them to gain
hardiness at least in the 2, 4,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7, but the model actually predicts that at
11, it's still gaining hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 22, we didn't expect them to gain
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at the data for five weeks,
they did not gain any hardiness in those
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we looked at the field,
at the same time, they were gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went to see why this was
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the field temperatures,
yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were not rooted cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the buds in single node
cuttings without a root.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the temperatures in the
field, we see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And comparing to the temperatures that we
had in our growth chambers, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: that the blue line, which is 2 Celsius,
is really close to the minimum temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: that these buds were experiencing out in
the field, except for really the later
[SPEAKER_00]: portion here of that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it didn't really make any sense
that at least in the 2, they should be
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining some hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the daily average
temperature instead of the hourly data,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that really for most of the
period, it is above that 2 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the average for the whole period is
actually around 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really expected them to gain
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was something to learn about
this, that even though they were touching
[SPEAKER_00]: that 2 degrees line, it was cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some temperature amplitude going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what I did was I tried to
search things related to how temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling affected plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came across an entomology paper that
said, the title is something like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Effects of Neglecting Temperature
Amplitude in Insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though the results were not
relevant to this, I liked the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the effects of neglecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is exactly what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were neglecting the temperature
amplitude that they experienced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field and just going with constant
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we decided to expose them to a
cycling chamber, so we took buds from 2,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7, and 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved them into a chamber that was
cycling from 1.5 Celsius up to 12.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the average temperature was still
7 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were going very close to what the
2 was and a little bit above what 11 was.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at these buds that were now
experiencing cycling temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw that after we moved them into the
cycling, they gained hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, even in the 2 Celsius,
which was essentially only experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures higher than what it had seen
before, they did gain hardiness in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came up with a term that took into
account daily variations in temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is sigma T is what we called,
that would perhaps fix or model there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did, I'm not going to show much of
this, but we did do RNA-seq with these
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a cytoskeleton reorganization
is upregulated in the buds that gain
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, ABA was downregulated,
which is something that is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: counterintuitive, but we have a hypothesis
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't have time to talk about it,
but if you're curious, we can talk later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just showing some results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year, we decided to try different
temperature amplitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see here that if you have the
buds at 7, 7 plus and minus 3 Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: so going from 4 to 10, and 7 plus and
minus 5, so going from 2 all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, you'll see that when you have a range
that is smaller, it doesn't make the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: gain hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing the blue and the orange line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you give it that nice 10 degrees
range, the temperature variation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually have, I just realized that
every time I was pointing, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually pointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the 7 plus and minus 5 was really
where we were seeing acclimation
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to show some other data with 2 and
2 plus and minus 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that with the 2 plus and minus
5, it is gaining a lot more hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average temperature here is still 2
Celsius, but it's gaining a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is information there that we have
to adapt into the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we take the sigma t and we plug it
into the model, we are able to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier portion of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use it for the whole thing,
it doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this idea that there's
different responses in one phase and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the other that we have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the acclimation,
the same type of thing, we take buds from
[SPEAKER_00]: the field and we cut them into single node
cuttings and we put them in growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers at different temperature to see
how they are responding to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This we did at multiple times during the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they had different chill
accumulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see here, the close dots are at
the lowest chill accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both at 10 and at 22 degrees C,
they have a very negligible rate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're losing hardiness very slowly at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you give more chilling, so the open
dots 800 hours, you'll see that they start
[SPEAKER_00]: losing hardiness slightly faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you give them 1600 hours of
chilling, that rate is much, much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that it's not really a
matter of where they are in their initial
[SPEAKER_00]: LT because these two time points they were
at about the same initial LT, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: rates are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at how these buds are
responding, essentially is if you take
[SPEAKER_00]: them from the field at different points in
time, they are losing their hardiness
[SPEAKER_00]: faster and faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at how this
relationship is, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, so we're normalizing by
temperature and seeing from a percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: wise, what is happening there,
we see this logistic curve in the rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at very low chilling, you have a very
low rate of the acclimation compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: when you actually have accumulated chill
here that we call the 100% of the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call this potential, the
acclimation potential, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing over time until you get to 100%
and then your rate is not as high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not changing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back there, we see that this is
increasing and it's a logistic increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created this analogy for how the
response happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is you have your chill accumulation
and imagine that these buds are airplanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when they have very little chill
accumulation, they're taking off,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they're gaining altitude,
they are increasing the speed until they
[SPEAKER_00]: reach a cruising speed when it's their
maximum chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this really depends on what
temperature they are experiencing and are
[SPEAKER_00]: they experiencing temperatures like this
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at their responses to
temperature as you add a point in your
[SPEAKER_00]: chill accumulation, you'll see that lower
temperatures, low temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: the acclimate slower than high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, you will have different
rates of the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you have two different types
of airplanes when you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them are going to respond in
the same way to chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are taking off, you are slow
regardless of what airplane you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you start gaining height, you're
increasing your speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the faster airplane is going to
be much faster in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were at very similar speeds in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full speed depends on the airplane,
which means that your rate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation depends on the temperature
that you're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we look at these responses to
temperature, you'll see that it appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: be that you could fit a linear rate in
here, but it will not give us the full
[SPEAKER_00]: information that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this process and think
about it as a biological process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do an Arrhenius plot, which is this
in the right, you'll see that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinuity in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all an exponential response
like it is in the lower temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures here are flipped,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really have to explore this
process, creating different responses for
[SPEAKER_00]: low and for high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we came up with is that the low
temperatures have an exponential response
[SPEAKER_00]: and the higher temperatures have a
logarithmic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And combined with the logistic response
for the potential for the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what we're seeing here is that
you have at the highest chill
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, you have the highest
potential rate of the acclimation over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you decrease your chilling
accumulation, you still have a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: curve or a similar response, but it's a
lower rate at a lower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get to the very low
chill accumulations here, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate at 22 is negligible compared to
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing 0.1 degrees per day,
whereas at full chilling, you're up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: C per day range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take this and we go back to our
field cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're putting in there is we're
integrating the effects of the rate of the
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation and the chill accumulation
throughout the whole winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we plug it into the model
corrected with the LTEs there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that we have fixed this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can predict much better where
the cold hardiness is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was one of the objectives that we
had to fix this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're very close to getting
there and having something that is useful
[SPEAKER_00]: for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some more exploration that we
can get from this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this, these are three
different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at riparia, Riesling,
and Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the bottom, you have the LTEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hardiness being lost over time
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top, we have the phenology,
so early bud phenology, or bud break,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which the three is what we consider to
be bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see that these genotypes,
they are staggered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the riparia loses its hardiness much
faster than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also breaks bud faster than the
other genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have Riesling and Cab
Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we take what we learned about the
rates of the acclimation, and we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: riparia is faster than Riesling,
which is also faster than Cab Sauvignon,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can fix them based on thermal time
calculation for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that we can actually put all
of them together based on this thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the fact that they perceive
temperatures differently across these
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at their phenology,
you see that Riesling and Cab Sauvignon
[SPEAKER_00]: are now together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are breaking bud at the same time
with the same thermal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But riparia is still breaking bud faster,
which might not make much sense now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll show you some data later on that
explains this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned endodormancy and
ecodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed you how the rates of the
acclimation change in that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really is a quantitative trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a continuous response in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically what we do is bud break
assays to measure the switch from
[SPEAKER_00]: endodormancy to ecodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that that's done is we take
buds from the field and we put them into a
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber, usually at 4C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they pour Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are accumulating chill at a
certain rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take buds from that growth
chamber into 22C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see how long they take to bud
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the response that you see is
there's differences between insufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling and full chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long it takes for bud break to
happen and how synchronized that bud break
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see here with insufficient
chilling that you're not synchronized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some buds are breaking, whereas others
are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get full chilling,
that bud break happens very synchronously.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this data looks like when you put it
in a graph is that as you accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: chill, here is time to bud break from when
you started your assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: At low chill accumulations, it takes a lot
longer and you see that this curve is more
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the synchronicity of those buds
breaking is lower than when you accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: more chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what's important here is that
the time difference from what is used for
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of data is the time to reach 50%
bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at those data, they are in the
graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical exploration of this is that
we'll create a linear rate for those buds
[SPEAKER_00]: for the time to bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an arbitrary time that is 28
days to bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what your chilling accumulation
is for that specific genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we do that, we're really ignoring
curvature that you can see in this data
[SPEAKER_00]: that is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you how that curvature is
actually similar to what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: our rates of the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I actually started looking at this
was because when I looked at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of that curve, that rate that is
in there is actually very close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of the acclimation at four Celsius
that we saw when we were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: deacclimate them at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you how that affects your
time to bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if up here we have, similar to the
grass that I was showing you earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have bud break on top and your initial
LTE in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take those buds and you put them
into forcing conditions, so at a high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you measure their LTE there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a normal distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to lose hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine that you're keeping your air
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you're looking at the air in the
horizontal direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the buds that have the least hardiness
are getting to the bud break part faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that are lower are getting to
the bud break later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at the shape of the
curve that we had before, it just changes
[SPEAKER_00]: from a probability density function into a
cumulative density function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you see that, imagine that you
have lower chill accumulation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a slower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have that more slanted curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're taking more time to reach bud
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you accumulate chill, so with a lot
more chill accumulated in that four C
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber, you'll see that the rates are
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your bud break is happening in a
shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that that curve is sharper
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at the time to bud break,
it's the size of the bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you started the bud break essay
until when you saw 50% bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see that the time to bud break
is a lot shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we expect, however, is that instead
of having this sort of behavior that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring here, is that we are losing
hardiness at four C as you accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine that you took those buds from
the field very early in the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they haven't accumulated any chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you start giving them chilling,
they actually start responding even to
[SPEAKER_00]: those temperatures in which they are
accumulating chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are going to start losing
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of measuring your time to bud
break as these bars that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: previously, because you're starting from a
different start point, you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a shorter time to bud break
there than what you actually expected it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be if you have the same initial LTE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you actually try it later on and
you have already maximized your rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the acclimation, you're still going to
perceive a shorter time to bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not based on the response of
the buds to that four C essay,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really how they are responding to the
temperature in which you're storing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take that into account,
then we're able to separate this in three
[SPEAKER_00]: different portions that you're getting to
with the bud break assays, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: combining all of them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is your initial LTE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending where you were in the
beginning of when you collected your buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives you part of the time to bud
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other portion is the rates of the
acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how fast a given genotype is,
that's going to give you a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last piece of information is
really its response to chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it responding to that chilling
accumulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: When is it maximized?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the third piece of information
that you actually combine all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: into a single data point when you explore
them as the time to bud break in a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is just showing what we expect is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this data sort of works with,
if you see the open dots here that are
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly lower than the closed dots,
those had a lower, a higher initial LTE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are the dotted line here and the
dark dots are the dashed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works with the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have to have an experiment where
we actually track the LTEs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the experiment and the time
to bud break so we can really make sure of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the hypothesis that we're
working on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at gene expression of buds
losing hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we saw was that
the ABA pathway was downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were decreasing their ABA
production as they lost hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we tried to use that information
into actually applying into the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we took buds and we put them in
a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied ABA to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed them with very high rates
compared to what you typically have in
[SPEAKER_00]: field applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used 0, 10, and 20 millimolars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was that in those that we
applied ABA, they stopped losing
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you don't apply it,
it's still losing hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that also in the phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a delayed phenology when you
apply ABA to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took that information from our
RNA-seq data into applying it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of this is just taking that
information is really exploring that LTE
[SPEAKER_00]: data to its maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was this guy who said in 1897,
he said that the direct observation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing cell is the best means of
obtaining information on the causes of
[SPEAKER_00]: death by freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is really because we are very
visual creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to see what's happening so that we
really believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started using X-ray phase contrast,
which is a non-destructive method to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at how freezing was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what this is, is that we're
taking X-rays and we're keeping only the
[SPEAKER_00]: portion that is very... All of the X-rays
are not deviating from the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extend them and we pass them through
the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those X-rays will interact with the
densities, with the different densities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they go by, you'll see that some of
them are going to interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change their path slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that interaction,
you actually have a signal in an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get your X-rays there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different from what absorption
X-ray is when you break a bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the variations in density are very
slight here in the green tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not able to use the absorption
X-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also doing this while we were
freezing the buds and rotating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing a CT scan of buds at the
synchrotron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to show you what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bud of riparia that we're
slowly slicing through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is after the reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing the xylem vessels here in
the stem portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you might remember,
I mentioned the bud cushion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that there is no vascularization
here in the base of the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really connected to the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what gives it the ability to
super cool the fact that it's separated
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the images look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at them afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also incorporated in this is we use
needle thermocouples.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a tiny thermocouple in the tip
of that needle that measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to stick those inside the
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just comparing in the field
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that the bud temperature
sometimes is different than the air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm showing you this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually going to scroll through
it, because you're going to see the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bud of amaranthus as it's
freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is really an expansion of
the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go back and forth, and you'll see
that it looks like it's breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we can identify that the
base of the bud is where the freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: actually starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it propagates throughout the
whole bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that the top portions of
the bud is only freezing much later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole process of freezing actually
happens through a time span of three
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were lowering the temperature at 50
degrees Celsius per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very steep rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still freezing only.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still taking three minutes for it
to fully freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we reconstruct these buds,
we're able to see what they look like from
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see this is riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that the bud is really
expanding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to notice, if you remember
that riparia had a different phenology
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the viniferous, you'll see
here that at day six, you already have
[SPEAKER_00]: these scales separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're already at a different state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is stage one, this is stage two,
and this is what we call stage three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that the inflorescence is
expanding very quickly throughout that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a non-destructive method,
we're able to actually measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing of these specific buds with those
needle thermocouples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that that bud at day zero
was freezing at minus 22 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at day six, that bud was freezing at
minus 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bud was freezing at minus 15 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at day 13, that bud that was already
very large was freezing at about minus
[SPEAKER_00]: eight Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that hardiness being lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to actually measure from
the specific buds that we're imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vinifera here, looking at day zero and
day 13, so the extremes that I showed you
[SPEAKER_00]: for riparia, you'll see that vinifera is
still closed at day 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's lost all of its
hardiness, it's still a closed bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it's swollen,
it's a little bit larger, but we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive it yet as being a stage two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its phenology is delayed compared to
that of riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's largely because of the
difference in growth between those
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vinifera is actually expanding the base a
lot more than its inflorescences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the inflorescences are still small,
and it already lost all of its hardiness,
[SPEAKER_00]: as compared to in riparia, where we're
seeing that really large inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emirance is a different wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting in its structure,
because even at day zero, you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of tissue in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all green, it doesn't have all
that air space that we were seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is looking at day zero from those
three species, and you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: emirance is really full of green tissue,
there's no air pockets in it, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: other species have air pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have very different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are to scale, these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting to see that this was
the bud that was freezing in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the different portions of
it expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're able to take that information
to study specific tissues of the bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually learn what is happening in
those tissues that it's failing for its
[SPEAKER_00]: cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the conclusions that we take
from the data that I showed you is that
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation and deacclimation portions,
they respond differently to the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature stimulus, and really is the
acclimation is responding both to the
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute temperature that the buds are
experiencing and the amplitude of that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, whereas the deacclimation is
really only responding to the absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not a linear response as
typically is used with those data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dormancy transition is a quantitative
trait, and this is very helpful for us
[SPEAKER_00]: because now we can explore it better and
we can separate those three traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: are associated with the dormancy studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's information that we get
from the bud break data that perhaps we
[SPEAKER_00]: won't necessarily see if we just use the
rates of the acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps combining those two is a
necessary step that we need to really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what is the dormancy and how is
chilling being accumulated in the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the acclimation is part
partially growth, and I put that partially
[SPEAKER_00]: in there because we see, especially in the
field, we see reacclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they experience warm temperatures
and then the temperature lowers again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll gain a little bit of hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a slightly reversible process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was only growth, we know that
the definition of growth tells us that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is an irreversible process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the loss of hardiness can't be only
growth because otherwise we wouldn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: that reversibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially because it is partially
growth is that when we use ABA,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to stop that growth from
happening, and then we prevent that loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the application in the
field is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might be able to, in the future,
apply ABA and prevent damage in the later
[SPEAKER_00]: winter if they don't lose their hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to thank all the
people that helped me with collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: data, especially Dr. Thorne from my
committee and Ken at CHESS, who is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that pushed me into getting those images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really special thanks for the lab
group, the Rice Group, and Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jason was the one who said,
every time I came up with a good idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: not a good idea, with an idea,
he would say, yeah, we should try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Bruce was the one who put the
steps on the break and said, about this
[SPEAKER_00]: time last year, he was like, maybe you
shouldn't be sitting on this mountain of
[SPEAKER_00]: data, and you should start working on it
towards finishing your degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for them for working together
into something that I guess worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for listening to me,
and I can take questions that you may
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How practical and economically feasible do
you think it would be to spray ABA on an
[SPEAKER_00]: orchard?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Geneva can usually hear the
question, but the question was,
[SPEAKER_00]: how practical and feasible would it be to
apply ABA to the orchard?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very expensive product right now,
and the concentrations that we were using
[SPEAKER_00]: were very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about the amount of wood
that is going to be left in your vineyard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is very small, the volume that
you would be applying if it was directed
[SPEAKER_00]: would be very, very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with that comes a lot of
problems, like the ABA is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: photosensitive molecule, the S-ABA that is
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying it right now in the
field to see if it actually works with
[SPEAKER_00]: just spraying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it might get degraded before it
can have an effect on the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think now that we understand that ABA
can have an effect and that we can use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we start exploring how applicable it
is to use it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's coming to a, we have an idea of
how to mitigate the damage, not just know
[SPEAKER_00]: that damage happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had exchanged an email about the
molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation
[SPEAKER_01]: and these late embryogenesis proteins that
are intrinsically disordered and how they
[SPEAKER_01]: might act as cryoprotectants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you given any more thought to that or
in general to the molecular mechanisms by
[SPEAKER_01]: which they're becoming cold hardy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the question is if I have given
any thought to the molecular mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, we have a data set
for RNAseq on what is change and what
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are being differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really analyzed it fully to see
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, there's reorganization of
the cytoskeleton, which is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens, that has been seen in other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a low temperature
correlated protein that I remember seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a gibberellin related response,
so plant hormones playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the cytoskeleton side,
it's interesting that they are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: their structure, the structures of the
cells from the physical standpoint because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are able to resist a very low
temperature and maintaining that water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the liquid state in an interface with ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually lowering their water
potential to a very negative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're withstanding minus 250 bars or
something close to that in those cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that doesn't typically
happen except for in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that there's a need for
structural reconfiguration of the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, more than that, we haven't seen
and we actually expect that a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: a response to dehydration because those
buds actually lose water in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the earlier portions of the
winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting look to see how many of
the upregulated proteins are intended to
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: The structure of the proteins,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones are known to be intrinsic to
disorder?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hannah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to just contextualize
this within an applied plant breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you say to Bruce that he
should begin collecting on to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: cold hardiness?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is now with this
information, how do we apply this into a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the best pieces of
information that we can take from this is
[SPEAKER_00]: that split from the bud break assay that
we're usually looking for things that
[SPEAKER_00]: require more chilling so that they break
buds later and they're not damaged by late
[SPEAKER_00]: frosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really we can now split it into what
has the lowest LT, what has a low
[SPEAKER_00]: deacclimation rate, and what has a higher
chilling requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can really maximize the whole
process to have the plants coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the spring so that they don't
suffer any damage from late frosts and
[SPEAKER_00]: really late winter dips in temperature
after they would expect to have
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think really what I gave him,
what I expected to give him were markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I gave him was now a phenotype so
that he can go after the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Al.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
