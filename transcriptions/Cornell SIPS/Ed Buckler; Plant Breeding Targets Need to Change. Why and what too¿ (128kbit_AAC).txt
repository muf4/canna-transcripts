[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you've had a chance to read some
of these, but we'll get back to it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make the argument today that
plant breeding targets need to pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentally change because we've
accomplished a lot of the key goals over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last century to talk about what we've
accomplished and what we perhaps need to
[SPEAKER_01]: change too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I get into it, I want to talk
about how this change happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off something that we're
familiar with, the shift to hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was based on a technology breakthrough
that essentially gave a 20% increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it started to hit Iowa as a
commercial product, it essentially swept
[SPEAKER_01]: it in about six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, these shifts aren't just
with corn and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: car came in and essentially in a 10-year
period replaced the horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It destroyed numerous prior markets that
had lasted for millennia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it essentially created much of the
20th century economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shift that we remember much more
closely, of course, is the smartphone
[SPEAKER_01]: shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in the U.S., the smartphone took
over the entire market in about nine
[SPEAKER_01]: years, destroyed all sorts of other
technologies that had been out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: separate industries, but it also created
lots of other new technology areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: social waves, and even enabled remote
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how has change impacted breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I define breeding as the design and
selection of organisms for human purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while the technology and knowledge and
scientific discovery around hybrid vigor
[SPEAKER_01]: really started around 1908, but by the
time it hits the market in the 1930s,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you see this first big increase in
yield, and then through iteration and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding over the last 80 years,
we've resulted in this eightfold increase
[SPEAKER_01]: in maize yield, half coming from genetics
and half coming from agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that type of success has dramatically
changed the shape of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ag productivity gains have essentially
allowed time for modern life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of Americans no longer
live in rural environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only a small proportion of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: now is involved in farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding success has also resulted in some
ecological gains.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, by getting those higher
yields, the northern part of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: now has 16% more forested land than did in
1900, despite having much larger
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, internationally,
what's happened with breeding is that now
[SPEAKER_01]: the vast majority of the globe's
population has enough calories and
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that comes from the efforts of
people like Norman Borlaug and the Green
[SPEAKER_01]: Revolution to deliver these changes in
breeding and agronomy globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are tremendous successes in the last
century.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are this century's challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our first challenge is really
improving global diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the prior century reduced the
problem with insufficient calories and
[SPEAKER_01]: protein, we still have the vast majority
of the globe's population with imbalanced
[SPEAKER_01]: diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either poor nutrition or too many empty
calories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the vision we should be going
towards is one where we've essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminated everybody with insufficient
calories or protein by providing access to
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative proteins and really adapting
this productive growth across the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second area is we really need
to tackle these imbalanced diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're talking about making it
accessible to get to quality fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and all sorts of microbial
foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can tackle those two issues,
then most of the planet will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy diet by the end of the century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our other giant challenge, of course,
is dealing with climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means dealing with increased
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means dealing with pests and diseases
that are destroying our crops as they move
[SPEAKER_01]: into new environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means dealing with extreme weather
events, more floods, more droughts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and damaging wind events.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, plant breeding can also
play a key role in ameliorating these
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we need to come up with better
abatement technologies in the production
[SPEAKER_01]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also can play, as I'll discuss,
a really key role in potentially doing
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think plant breeding should really be
focused in on creating healthy diets,
[SPEAKER_01]: a circular agriculture, and sequestering
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why aren't we focused on these?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because a couple other
demands have really been focusing our
[SPEAKER_01]: attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other areas haven't been the big
focus because plant breeding has been in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of supporting a massive
sevenfold increase in protein demand
[SPEAKER_01]: that's essentially stretching over 90
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: To meet this protein demand, essentially
half of all habitable land on the globe is
[SPEAKER_01]: being used by agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three quarters of that ag land is for
livestock, and the rest of it's for crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, we're pretty much already
maxed out for use of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the US really isn't any different from
the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a graphic made by Bloomberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that livestock really
dominate land use across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the proportion of area we use for food
we directly use is very modest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you look at our crop land,
essentially our four largest production
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, wheat, hay, soybean, and corn,
are really all about calories and protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them are all about really
supporting these protein production
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you ask, what is the food
system's biggest challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's figuring out how to get nitrogen and
protein into people's diets efficiently,
[SPEAKER_01]: and dealing with these increases in
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still, many people around the globe
don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is that humans already dominate
the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We control about 50% of the nitrogen flux
per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast, we only control about 6% of
the carbon flux per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, we still have a massive problem
with climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's estimated that essentially half the
people on the planet are here directly
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the invention of the
Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are in an area with nitrogen where
we're already, with our current production
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches, essentially maxed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why is the system so complex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we using so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of it is because we have a
very complex system for how nitrogen gets
[SPEAKER_01]: to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts out with us essentially in the
United States case, drilling a hole in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, extracting natural gas from that,
creating hydrogen from that, plugging that
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Haber-Bosch reaction,
creating fertilizer, injecting it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope our plants take up some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to synthesize amino acids,
which is then used for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's then remobilized into the seed,
and we harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we give it to our livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow those animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We slaughter the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we eat the animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in each one of these steps,
scientists and engineers and business
[SPEAKER_01]: people, farmers, have worked very hard to
optimize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the problem is the total
number of steps here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it isn't just that the Haber-Bosch has
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that essentially biological,
we got into this situation because
[SPEAKER_01]: biological nitrogen fixation is land
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you compare maize yields versus
soybean yields, they're grown by the same
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers on the same fields using the same
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially maize yields about three
times as much per acre as soybeans do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that has to do with the
amount of energy soybeans use to fix
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Globally, we face a similar type of
situation, for example, in sub-Saharan
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa, where we're expecting to have the
largest population growth in the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, in order to get sub-Saharan
Africa to be self-sufficient by 2050,
[SPEAKER_01]: we either need to vastly increase the
amount of land under agriculture or vastly
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the amount of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the fundamental trade-off that
needs to go on in order to make some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these areas across the globe
self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to highlight that nitrogen,
although it's critically important,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's also one of the major inputs and
major energy costs and major farmer costs
[SPEAKER_01]: for their crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although maize is a very efficient
crop, more than 10 to 1 energy in to
[SPEAKER_01]: energy out, over half the energy input is
coming from the nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the greenhouse gas
emissions for a crop like maize,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 80% of its greenhouse gas emissions
are coming from nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about the weaknesses of
maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, animals are actually the least
efficient portion of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: With beef being the most inefficient at
only about 3% of efficiency, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: eggs are actually quite good at 31%
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, animals are very inefficient
at converting input protein to
[SPEAKER_01]: human-consumed protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does nitrogen get to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're essentially using about 1% of the
globe's energy to produce fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lose about 50% of the nitrogen when we
try to get into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can essentially lose anywhere
from nearly 70% to 97% of that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids as we go through animal
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to end here with essentially
that thought experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How close could one get to maximum
efficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a single person needs about 57 grams
of protein per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we break that down into those amino
acids that make it up, we assume we get
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen through some energy process,
such as plasma generation of fixed
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're then going to get the carbon from
glucose, and that could come from
[SPEAKER_01]: something like maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works out to be about half an ear per
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we scale that across the globe,
essentially, you could feed 7.6 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: people and about 21 million hectares of
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the area of Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look globally, essentially,
1.5% of global arable land could fix all
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon needed for the global protein
demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a straight chemical processing point
of view, it doesn't actually take that
[SPEAKER_01]: much land to produce all of the protein
necessary to support the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a straight chemistry point of
view, yeah, it looks like it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly straightforward to support the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But does any of this make economic sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the type of question that RethinkX
was asking, and they published a report on
[SPEAKER_01]: this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would highly recommend that
everybody take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their central premise is that
precision fermentation, essentially the
[SPEAKER_01]: production of high quality proteins,
this basic biology has really been figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out and engineering has been figured out
over the last five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's continuing to roll out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the next four years,
they expect those precision high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins to only cost about $10 per
kilogram by 2024 and down to as low as $1
[SPEAKER_01]: per kilogram by 2035.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, they expect nearly a
70% reduction in cows because essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: those production numbers are so low that
these high quality proteins will
[SPEAKER_01]: outcompete animal protein in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've modeled how precision protein
costs have developed over time,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with things like insulin and then
industrial enzymes for cleaning and now
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial enzymes for biofuels and
cellulose breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're moving into the period where
we're using these precision proteins for
[SPEAKER_01]: food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they've done here is
essentially taken us to where we were a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years ago and essentially are
modeling with scaling improvements in,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, new technologies like
continuous flow fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They expect these to continue to drop for
yet another decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their key predictions is that they
believe that industrial products such as
[SPEAKER_01]: whey and casein, which are really chosen
and used by industrial food processors,
[SPEAKER_01]: will be one of the first areas to be
disrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are predicting that milk protein
costs will essentially cross over with the
[SPEAKER_01]: whey and casein costs in about four years
from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there isn't, consumer
preferences don't play a strong role here,
[SPEAKER_01]: they think that this transition will
essentially occur pretty much straight on
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that we probably know about more
in the market is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation-based beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of impossible burgers here,
where essentially people are taking plant
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins and adding things like hemoglobin
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There they think the prices are roughly
going to cross over by 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cell-based beef, they're
predicting that those prices will cross
[SPEAKER_01]: over by 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cell-based beef one is much
less clear as to where that one's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, those are their two key
predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I started out in our discussion,
they essentially believe that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to try to eliminate animals from the
food system and that they can undercut
[SPEAKER_01]: these price points dramatically relative
to what animal production can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you see, even for dairy,
they hope to essentially collapse the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the question is, are these just
bribed or just claims, or is there
[SPEAKER_01]: something real to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first thing I would highlight is
that essentially in the last few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: 44 alternative protein companies have
already been started up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even in a year like this, they're
getting vast amounts of venture capital
[SPEAKER_01]: invested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to take a look at some of
the underlying assumptions behind this to
[SPEAKER_01]: see if this is at all realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've plotted out here is
essentially the landscape of protein
[SPEAKER_01]: prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left-hand side, essentially
these are various animal proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're essentially wholesale prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've listed here is the cost of
that item, their wholesale price,
[SPEAKER_01]: in dollars per kilogram of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're assuming that the only thing
we're buying the item for is forage
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle, if you look below,
these are pretty much the high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: plant proteins that we're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the right-hand side,
essentially these are various types of
[SPEAKER_01]: feedstocks and fermentation products that
have high levels of protein in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll highlight a few things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of some of these costs,
peanuts and things like that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may have noticed I talked
about mussels a while ago, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually the cheapest animal
protein that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final thing I want you to
highlight is that the red bars are
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially what RethinkX believes these
cost per proteins will be at various time
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is the red bar in five years from
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They believe that precision protein will
be at $10 for a kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 15 years from now,
it'll be down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with a species I know a lot
about, corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And corn's cost of protein is a little bit
above that $1 per kilogram, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly a starch product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today, a lot of that corn goes into
production of ethanol, and that goes on to
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting auto industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the residual from that is dried
distiller's grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those dried distiller's grain are
actually the cheapest source of protein
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are then fed to, for example,
beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's essentially nearly a 65-fold
difference between the cost of that
[SPEAKER_01]: protein and the cost of ground beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the fundamental aspect,
is that price difference between those
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where economic opportunities for
precision protein comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So RethinkX is really predicting
disruption of a couple key markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is that dairy market with
casein and whey, which represent about 40%
[SPEAKER_01]: of the dairy market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you have nearly about a
seven-fold differential and ventral price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other market is for things like
ground beef, where there's this 30-fold
[SPEAKER_01]: differential between the cost of precision
protein and the cost of ground beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this $1 per kilogram number even
possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first thing I would highlight
to you all is dried distiller's grains are
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not a refined protein,
but they're already well below that price
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean, you're not going to do it
probably directly from soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They essentially cost the same as this $1
per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean meal is also probably too close in
order to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the cost of ammonia and
sugar, or if you were to really shift it
[SPEAKER_01]: to ammonia and starch, and you had on-site
production of ammonia in various aspects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can imagine that your feedstocks would
cost about one-eighth the cost of that
[SPEAKER_01]: refined precision protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's certainly biochemically
possible to get to this $1 per kilogram
[SPEAKER_01]: price point, which could be incredibly
disruptive to all other production systems
[SPEAKER_01]: of protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's possible, and I think it
could happen in the next 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go with RethinkX's estimates,
you're talking about essentially massive
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts on land use and economic
livelihoods, because essentially half of
[SPEAKER_01]: all land is being used for various types
of agricultural production, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of that is for livestocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: One way to think about this is that
roughly two billion hectares of range land
[SPEAKER_01]: may no longer have a livestock market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would this look like for just U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: corn and soy land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there would likely be a massive drop
in the need for livestock feed by
[SPEAKER_01]: mid-century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Processed food might slightly go up in
order to support some of these systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: and industrial carbon would likely go up
substantially in order to support things
[SPEAKER_01]: like plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, nearly half of the acreage
would not be needed to support current
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this could either go into ecosystem
services, which we'll talk about more
[SPEAKER_01]: later, or the land could go compete in
things like the wheat market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it competed in the wheat market,
this is enough land that essentially it
[SPEAKER_01]: could produce half of the globe's total
wheat needs and would likely displace
[SPEAKER_01]: other producers around the globe that were
less efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what then would be the risk for
smallholders in rural communities
[SPEAKER_01]: globally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could imagine dairy markets
pretty much disappearing, land values
[SPEAKER_01]: crashing, and essentially meat markets
maybe cut in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are all really big issues for
how we support and think about these types
[SPEAKER_01]: of transitions that I think could
potentially come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of smallholders,
how could they take advantage of these
[SPEAKER_01]: types of changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one way to kind of think about it is
this precision fermentation system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are really micro-brewery scale
fermenters, and they're maybe on the scale
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to support 1,000 to 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could produce a wide range of
different products, everything from beer
[SPEAKER_01]: to precision protein, water-soluble
vitamins, lipid-soluble vitamins,
[SPEAKER_01]: to really support most of some of the key
needs and nutrients that people need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the inputs are relatively simple,
things like maize or cassava, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia either coming from the Haber-Bosch
reaction or from electric arc type
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how could some smallholders take
advantage of these changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, currently, most of the nitrogen that
is used for things like crop is coming by
[SPEAKER_01]: intercropping from legumes and other types
of biological nitrogen fixations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we imagine that essentially we're
shifted over to a world where maybe we're
[SPEAKER_01]: having low-protein maize, we may be able
to actually recycle some of that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and increase nitrogen levels in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then additionally, reduce animal
consumption of Stover could both enhance
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon and soil nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you're getting starch and oil
from crops like maize and protein from
[SPEAKER_01]: intercropped legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're getting additional protein
and additional nutritional balance from
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbrewery type of approaches that
are being driven from the starch in these
[SPEAKER_01]: various crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think although we're talking about
lots of instability, there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: positives that you could see for
smallholders, potentially greater food
[SPEAKER_01]: security and nutrition, micro-maracas and
co-op fermenters, potentially better
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, and higher crop yields due to
better nitrogen balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, I think we're at a place
where plant breeding could be focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we really should be focused in
on healthy diets, a circular agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's first turn to healthy diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go into a lot of detail
here, because I think a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_01]: our community know a lot more about how to
do this than I.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, I think we should really
be breeding for both flavor, nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: and controlled environments, whether
that's Michael Missouri's mini butternut
[SPEAKER_01]: squash, Mike Gore's work in producing
high-protein vitamin A, or Neil Mattson
[SPEAKER_01]: and colleagues working on controlled
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are all really key areas
where we should be targeting or breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: towards in order to create a much wider,
better set of products coming out of each
[SPEAKER_01]: of these environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where I think new efforts like
USDA's breeding insight can be a really
[SPEAKER_01]: great key partner in helping us breed for
things like flavor, nutrient, and
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know ARS and Moira want to make this
a high priority, and I hope we can all
[SPEAKER_01]: work together towards those goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next area that plant breeders should
really focus on is circular agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we talk about circular or
nutrient economies, what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about is taking the amount of nitrogen and
phosphorus that we certainly need for
[SPEAKER_01]: growth of our plants to produce the food
and everything, and essentially just
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing it and keeping more of the
nitrogen on farm and remobilizing it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't need as much nitrogen to be
brought onto the farm each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a reminder, in the case of maize,
for example, over 80% of those greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: emissions are coming from nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have issues such as runoff
going into things like the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nearly 60% of the nitrogen in the Gulf of
Mexico is coming from agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these loss of nutrients is an economic
loss to the farmers, and it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big targets we need to focus
on in plant breeding is really breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: for entire agro-ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops and perennials, we know if we
combine them in an integrated breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: management can really improve both soil
biology, nutrient cycling, drought,
[SPEAKER_01]: and flood tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of these tools we're
talking about can be brought together in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to rapidly breed for cover crops to
support a lot of our major row crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them much more circular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also want us to think in other ways
about how we can create a circular
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fall colors are a reminder of how
perennials are recycling nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we're seeing those colors is
they've already moved all their nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and phosphorus out of the leaves and are
saving that for the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of these strategies can we borrow
for agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been thinking about concepts,
for example, about low-protein maize,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you look at it in maize here,
while it's not high in protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: because its yield is so high, there's
nearly 800 kilograms per hectare of
[SPEAKER_01]: protein in a maize field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about that, that's
roughly the same amount of protein that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in 14 head of steer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if we were able to kind of save
that back into the ground or reuse it
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow for the coming year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we drop the protein down where it's
not really being used very effectively and
[SPEAKER_01]: save it for the next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fundamentally the question that
Travis Rooney has been asking in our
[SPEAKER_01]: group.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been wondering, can we make annuals
more like perennials?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the conventional maize
variety, we take lots of nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, we add it to our plants,
and we get both volatilization and runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we get a big loss of nitrogen and
phosphorus there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we pick up the grain and we use a
lot of the starch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some uses for the protein,
but for example, we have too much
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus in our pig lagoons and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's asked the simple question,
well, can we use that nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, of course, during the growing
season, but then leave it in the cobs and
[SPEAKER_01]: not put it in the kernels?
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, then recycle those cobs
each year so that essentially we take off
[SPEAKER_01]: the starch, but we've really focused on
recycling the nitrogen and phosphorus for
[SPEAKER_01]: the coming year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already talked about circular
agriculture, and that can play an
[SPEAKER_01]: important role in reducing greenhouse
gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it plays a role in this top part of
the graph, whether it's energy production
[SPEAKER_01]: or all sorts of other approaches,
we need to really reduce total CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilizer production requires 1% of the
globe's energy, the nitrous oxide coming
[SPEAKER_01]: off our crops are a major greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's greater efficiency here as a
double win for both farmers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to now turn to what should
plant breeding do to really sequester
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the century, we need to
develop plants that would be sequestering
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20 gigatons of CO2 per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of important industrial
sectors that still require carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds for decades to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: These need to be serviced first in order
to eliminate the use of fossil fuels
[SPEAKER_01]: before we focus solely on carbon
sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's three main areas where
plant breeding can play a role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those we're already doing right
now, and that's ethanol production to
[SPEAKER_01]: replace gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can be efficient approaches if
we refine them with solar and wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plants can also be base polymers for
plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if we solar and wind energy is used
to process them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, our plants or our
grasses can be used for deep carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to remind everyone that plants
are quite competitive in terms of stray
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a dollar per joule basis, they're much
better than wind or even natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I think we need to also
look more carefully at ethanol production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ask really, why is it not as efficient
as we'd like it to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing and transporting maize is really
not the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a relatively minor part of the total
amount of non-renewable energy that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, it's the ethanol conversion,
especially the distillation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I think we should view
ethanol more like hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an electron carrier, and we should
use it and process it with solar or wind
[SPEAKER_01]: energy to convert it into a form that we
can use as a liquid fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has, of course, the major
advantages relative to hydrogen of already
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the established market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we start sequestering carbon,
I think we need to make sure we're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: and have carbon neutral fuels and
plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine, for example, the
transportation sector, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will quickly, in the next few decades,
maybe convert to 75% electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may still require about a quarter
of it, some kind of liquid fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like maize could essentially
service that quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastics, again, we need to eliminate
fossil fuels there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, you could shift to essentially
100% renewable with about 10 million
[SPEAKER_01]: hectares of maize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a really nice article by Pose in a
couple years, years ago highlighted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could really go greenhouse gas
negative if you combined it with renewable
[SPEAKER_01]: processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for both of these areas, it's really
about the processing that's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's turn our attention to
sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fundamentally, how do we pull 10 to 20
gigatons of CO2 from the air?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at photosynthesis by
ecosystem, essentially across the globe,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nearly 450 gigatons per year are
being pulled out of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you divide through those estimates
from what the National Research Council
[SPEAKER_01]: was estimating to require, it's about 2%
by 2050 and 4% of that global
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis by 2100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those numbers don't seem very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you start to realize,
well, we really only manage a much smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of those environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the ecosystems that we
manage, then you start talking about much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about using 5.7 and a
little over 11% of the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity in the sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's no way we could really do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If protein were competing for the exact
same land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is where I think those
discussions we had previously on what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the nature of protein production across
the globe likely to be over the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: decades is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially the same land is needed
for both purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a reminder, perennial grasses out
there are already sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grow very differently from a lot
of our annual crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the picture on the left, which you see
is a native perennial grass relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can tell, they grow very
differently in terms of their root
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question is, can we shift where
they're putting some of their carbon at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the year?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I think there's an
opportunity for plant breeding really to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop deep, persistent carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could happen both in some of our
annuals and our perennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's accompanied with many of the
other optimizations we've already been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, the overall harvest yield
loss above brown corn may be modest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn to our model maize and ask the
question, what would carbon sequestering
[SPEAKER_01]: maize look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in a highly productive maize crop,
about five tons of carbon is left every
[SPEAKER_01]: year in the stover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pull off about five tons in terms
of the harvested kernels.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're willing to essentially create a
maize plant that, say, lost 10% of its
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and maybe was somewhat shorter,
we may be able to essentially move
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially an additional ton of carbon
every year down deeper in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I do want to highlight that,
just as we heard last week from our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: science colleagues, deep carbon alone is
likely not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon really needs to be mineralized to
be able to stay there for hundreds or
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we talk about that,
we talk about complexing that carbon with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like magnesium or calcium and
getting it deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the questions I think we have on
the basic research side is, how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: combine some of the things we could do
with plants with how do we work with soil
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists on figuring out how to
mineralize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were able to sequester 20% of the
biomass to each of these areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: across the United States, you start
counting up that a substantial number of
[SPEAKER_01]: gigatons of CO2 could be sequestered every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that totals up to about 2.9 gigatons
per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is about 14% of the global target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it in terms of
dollar terms, a lot of people are assuming
[SPEAKER_01]: that carbon could be priced at nearly $50
per ton of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be essentially an equivalent to
about $142 billion market by the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the century for carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are, as you see,
a range of different ways we can go about
[SPEAKER_01]: using plant breeding to tackle the giant
problems of carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to give it a little frame of
reference, essentially if you compare the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of the problem of food production
versus carbon agriculture, just in
[SPEAKER_01]: straight amount of carbon, carbon
sequestration is about a six-fold larger
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in feeding people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a big problem, and we're going
to need to use a lot of different tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what should plant breeding be focused
on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's really about healthy
diets, circular agriculture, and about
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you ask what our biggest challenge
is during the 21st century in breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really figuring out how to solve both
these goals, which I think we can really
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really need to be thoughtful in
planning and work with consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, and the environment to work
through these massive transitions,
[SPEAKER_01]: because none of these transitions are
going to be small or easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you very much, and I'd be happy
to take some questions.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
