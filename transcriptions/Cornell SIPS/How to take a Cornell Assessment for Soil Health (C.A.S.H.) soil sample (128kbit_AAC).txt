[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell's comprehensive assessment of soil
health goes beyond just testing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like any soil testing, the information
it provides depends on how well you sample
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, as well as asking the right
questions before sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the Cornell Soil Health Lab
accepts samples year-round, the best time
[SPEAKER_01]: to take soil samples is in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should take your samples when the soil
is workable and neither too wet nor too
[SPEAKER_01]: dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good rule of thumb is if the field can
be plowed, it is probably a good time to
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you sample will depend on what
questions you're trying to answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to assess soil health for
an entire field or management unit with
[SPEAKER_01]: similar soils and management history,
walk through the entire field making a
[SPEAKER_01]: path that looks like a big W, taking sub
samples at 5 to 10 spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid areas that are not representative of
your entire sampling area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're trying to identify soil
constraints for trouble spots in a field,
[SPEAKER_01]: make your path just through the identified
weak part of the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sample this problem area as a separate
labeled sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also useful to take a sample from
outside of your management area to help
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify the effects of your management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've identified that this spot is a
good representation of our field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first step is to remove the debris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to dig that deep of a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for about eight inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is basically perfect for taking a
soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be slightly on the wet side,
but in the spring you got to kind of take
[SPEAKER_01]: it when you have a chance and this is our
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm removing the soil I set it to the
side so that I can put it back in the hole
[SPEAKER_01]: so we don't have any holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tractor might have problems with.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I've got about an eight inch
hole and now I'm going to take what we
[SPEAKER_01]: call a slice of bread from the edge of the
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for about two inches thick
by about the shovel wide and six inches
[SPEAKER_01]: deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we pull it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about perfectly six inches deep,
but now we're looking for the soil to be
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent or we want to have consistent
amounts of soil from the top layer down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the six inch mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm removing any extra soil from the
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for that nice even layer,
a little thicker at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to even it out a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sample one and then from there we
can move on and take the other samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will want to take a penetrometer
reading at each spot that you're sampling
[SPEAKER_01]: across the W shaped pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be looking at the zero
to six inch mark and also zero to 18 and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be watching the inner
gauge on the penetrometer and making a
[SPEAKER_01]: mental note of what the highest PSI you
reaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first we're going to go down to the six
inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this mark down here that shows us
the six inch and the 18 is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not feeling too much compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping an eye on the six inch mark
that hit about 150 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a mental note of that and then you
continue to the 18 inch mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start to feel more compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surpassing 300 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the plow pan and you got to push a
little bit farther to get to that 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hit about 400 PSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a mental note of how much
compaction I recorded with the
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrometer and I'm going to go ahead and
take the back of the submission form.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case this is location one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zero to six was 150 and six to 18 was
400.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right and then we're ready to move to
our next location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I've taken 10 subsamples across
the field in a W shaped pattern I will mix
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time I'm pulling any plant
matter out to make sure that we have an
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate sample to send to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have this well mixed soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no clods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is broken up really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soils are really nice consistency for
sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how the aggregates just sort of
crumble apart showing we have good
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably good microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go ahead and I take my labeled
Ziploc bag and I have my submission form
[SPEAKER_01]: right here which I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already filled out the front of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm in field E and I go ahead and
start taking samples out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that we typically do it in our
research plots kind of like take a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't really worry about sort of spilling
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toss some out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm avoiding any debris and I'm looking
for about six cups because I'm taking this
[SPEAKER_01]: for the extended package.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was taking it for the basic package
that requires three cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about three cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I'm going for the standard I'm
looking for about four cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd probably be nice for a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case we're doing the extended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking for six cups of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little more than six cups right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close your bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're ready to move on to your next
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you've collected all of your sub
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix them well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put them into a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go ahead and just make a
note of your GPS coordinates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should use whatever program works best
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need to record each section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of your sub samples if you want
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally I would just record the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send your soil samples via the United
States Post Office rapid shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember to include a submission form
with a blue ice pack in a labeled Ziploc
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note an ice pack is only necessary in the
hot months and is not needed if the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather is cool and you use rapid
shipping.

detailed instructions on taking a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sample including a field guide for soil
sampling and more information on soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health in general.
