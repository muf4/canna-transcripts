[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an interesting ride
today, being 35 plus years at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the title is, is it just grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe it was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were having it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it's a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want to, I think that's
my take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at turf and turf grass areas,
I see them from a slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective than maybe you might.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I want to share today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about this kind of
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always the laughter in my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I meet somebody, well, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, I work with grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the snicker is, is this kind of
grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, that's not even a grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least it's more like this kind of
grass that deal with golf courses and
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns and sod farms and athletic fields
and commercial grounds like campuses like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, airport strips, roadsides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anything that's using grass
species that are routinely mowed for all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of reasons and all kinds of
functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'd like to go over today are
some of the kind of functions that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: turf grasses in landscapes as well as part
of landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is an aesthetic component,
a financial component, a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one that I'll actually show a
bunch of data on is ecosystem function
[SPEAKER_00]: services for turf grass and landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can't deny that you have these
beautiful grassy vistas that, in this case
[SPEAKER_00]: on Eastern Long Island, a golf course,
or a beautiful sports field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe this is not that beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you play soccer on that field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have a little sneak attack over in
those shrubs to the bottom left there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be an interesting one to
maintain as well as kind of play on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a one to nothing kind of
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more like a sports field like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Yankee Stadium, that Frank's not here
today, but Frank has been very
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in working with Yankee
Stadium over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm from Pittsburgh, so the PNC Park
for the Pittsburgh Pirates, at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: team that made the playoffs the last two
years, unlike the Yankees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know, to kind of rub it in just a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times we think about golf and
sports turf as like the big thing of turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are the visible things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on television, articles written
about them, and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of kind of other uses
that we might see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see grasses used at art form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know Marshaim Shevely has done a
lot of kind of sod related projects from
[SPEAKER_00]: an art perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her students have done some really
cool things with grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times we think more of the
traditional version of a landscape that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see in suburban areas where you have a
green carpet adding to the value of this
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape that we see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one, it may be a visual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there are some financial
implications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been a number of surveys
looking at the economic value of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes to the property value itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so landscapes can add as much as 7% to
15% to the value of a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a poor landscape would get you less if
you were trying to sell that property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Clemson did a study showing that
homes with excellent landscapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can expect to sell price to be 6% to
7% higher than an equivalent good
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while improving your landscape from
average to good, you could even see a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of 4% to 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an economic value even though
there is a visual effect to these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you may not have known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to throw some facts out how
large the use of turf grasses are,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a study done in 2005 estimated
there were over 30 million acres of
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained turf in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we come a little bit closer to
home, New York State has 30 million land
[SPEAKER_00]: acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we added all the water and
whatever, New York State is bigger than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But New York State has 30 million land
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the turf that's in the United
States is big in the land area of New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within New York State, there are over 3.4
million acres of turf grass, accounting
[SPEAKER_00]: for, from 2003 figures, $5 billion per
year in maintenance costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly on residential properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 70% of the land area.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 43,000 workers with an annual
payroll of at least $500 million,
[SPEAKER_00]: done by the New York State Act Statistics
Service, not an industry group.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some people always like to point out
when you have surveys done, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just inflating these figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done by the New York State Act
Statistics Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of recreational
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get away from the beauty,
the financial value, there aren't too many
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, natural surfaces that we have
that you can recreate on constantly and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Frank, we're here, his daughter is
actually in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons I like to use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's from Trumansburg, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of our fields there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this, there really aren't
other natural surfaces that can take
[SPEAKER_00]: constant wear and traffic, soil
compaction, can be mowed closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those golf course settings, a putting
green can be as low as a tenth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't too many agricultural systems
we harvest that low and that frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully something will grow as part
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have some imposters to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, we have an example across
the street, this green is fakest that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to call, is we have a synthetic turf
across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was taken two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there irrigating the synthetic
turf across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of very ironic that
you would think in late October we're out
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's done to control the speed of
that surface for the ball roll that the
[SPEAKER_00]: field hockey players, the women's field
hockey field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with artificial surfaces,
you do need to do some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance, including irrigation to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'd really like to cover today is
to talk about the ecosystem services you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get from turf grasses and other
suburban landscapes in that context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is this, however,
if you're trying to talk about positives
[SPEAKER_00]: having ecosystem services, are there
negatives related to these kind of land
[SPEAKER_00]: uses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there has been shown, and I'm not
going to show data, but there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of studies shown that water quality
in suburban areas can be compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually the two things that are
compromised is phosphorus levels tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we were going to compare it to an
agricultural setting where those
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus levels may be higher in surface
waters than in agricultural areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen levels are actually lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show some data probably the
reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also pesticides that are
used in landscapes in these suburban areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that have compromised water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that, there have been restrictions
at both state and local levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: either restricting the type and amount and
season of application for pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and fertilizers, mostly
fertilizers, and banning pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If New York State has a ban on school
ground pesticide use, unless there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some very limited ones you're able to use,
or you can get an emergency exception to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jenny Galniffin's been doing a lot of
work with that because many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems we have on school grounds are
weed related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to manage weeds without the
traditional herbicide approach becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been one of the parts of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have seen regulations put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of us, I mean, I work in the
political end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And restrictions are made by politicians,
not by scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite often, I think if they really
understood the science behind what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to regulate, they might have done
something differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, New York State has a ban
on applying phosphorus to turf areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for a couple ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, if you're establishing a turf area,
you could put it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you take a soil test and there's a need
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the kind of two exceptions to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is the first one is,
and we will show you data, that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to be putting phosphorus down
at the time of establishment, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: very little plants there to hold on to
those nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And runoff and leaching can be pretty
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, that's the worst
time, when we look at all the studies done
[SPEAKER_00]: on the fate of fertilizers and turf,
that's the worst time environmentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regulators should have said,
do a soil test to see if you need
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus at establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that, be careful what you're
putting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just gave a blanket exception,
because there was a law passed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota, there was one in Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York legislators were smart enough
just to grab those and probably not take
[SPEAKER_00]: the advice of people like me who wrote to
them and asked them to consider not
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need phosphorus at establishment,
but if the soil is already adequate and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really do you very much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so from that, are there positives
ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say to counteract, but what are
the benefits we might see ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: function benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need to always evaluate
that in a landscape scale setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one thing that EPA put up
several years ago, make sure you keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer on your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you kind of go down there,
there is some stuff that talks about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to manage turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done a lot of research over the
years, and most of it I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: showing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are used to try to help improve the
management of turf to minimize
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spent a lot of time and effort
trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to cover today is kind of
three parts of ecosystem services that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had graduate students, and I'm
mostly giving my own graduate students
[SPEAKER_00]: data today, at looking at what you could
from a turf landscape, get what benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one large one we have found,
and other people have been studying this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that storm water amounts, the runoff
amounts, can be significantly lower in a
[SPEAKER_00]: turf grass area than they can in other
types of landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really based on the landscape
type, and the plant density, and the some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree age of that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one has to deal with soil
phosphorus and phosphorus runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might say, what kind of ecosystem
services is benefited from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you later, because that is
one of the sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one will talk about carbon
and nitrogen sequestration, which is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing these days in most ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we know about turf in that
context?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the storm water one and runoff talk
about in relationship to loading rates
[SPEAKER_00]: based on landscape type and plant density
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been fortunate over the years to
have a number of great grad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach Easton did a master's and a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was his master's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's currently down at VPI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw that he won the Outstanding
Assistant Professor in the College of
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't know I was training engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Zach went on to do very many great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was here as a postdoc in biological
environmental engineering for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and it took a faculty position down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a turf guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to see where some of your
grad students go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did he determine in his master's?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a slide showing plant density
on the bottom, shoot density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the left, you have the amount of
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right, the infiltration rate of
that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you double the shoots going from 5
to 10 shoots per centimeter, you cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of runoff by 2 thirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason you do that is the
infiltration rate doubled over that period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this kind of tells us several
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for some reason you lose plant density
or don't have a very dense surface to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with, runoff can be a major issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was done during an establishment
phase, the first three months of when
[SPEAKER_00]: these plots were put in, this graph was
put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this helps explain why I have this
concern over when you're putting down
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer and there's no plants there,
what do you think is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the chance for runoff can be quite
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, the volume of runoff, erosion,
and also what might be in that runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sites with low density, including
established, really have been shown in
[SPEAKER_00]: this study in a number of other studies to
pose the greatest risk to runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's established, as we'll see,
there isn't as much difference depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the landscapes there, as long as you
can maintain density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach went on to do a landscape scale,
and this is what started to get him into
[SPEAKER_00]: the engineering part, environmental
engineering, looking at landscape types in
[SPEAKER_00]: a suburban area and the amount of runoff
and its effect on a perennial stream going
[SPEAKER_00]: through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had two PhD students working with
Zach Easton's PhD and then Mark Slavin's
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, with looking at a slightly
different study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach's work was done in the northeast
section of Ithaca, going from Convenient
[SPEAKER_00]: Care on Warren Road to Kendall on
Triphammer, that subdivision in that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what this illustration shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the upper, this is the watershed that
that stream is affected by, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed, the head part of that watershed
is actually the ornithology lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of wooded areas up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we kind of look here,
this is basically his study area down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this perennial stream flows through
there, and he had a gauge here,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of looking at the inflow from the
area above and then the stream gauge below
[SPEAKER_00]: that measured what happened during that
area of suburbanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever driven through that,
it's a typical subdivision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homes built in the 50s, 60s, and 70s for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he looked at basically three
different landscape types, and there were
[SPEAKER_00]: three replicates in this study,
so let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the upper part of this watershed,
the numbers will be one, kind of the mid
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this watershed, two, and the ones
with three behind it are the lower part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is higher elevation, lower
elevation, and there was a big difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in that watershed, the location of that
watershed, what might happen with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at three different types of
residential landscapes, suburban
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape, a high-maintenance lawn,
convenient care, Kendall, all commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any control over what they
were doing, but we knew what they put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't something we defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact, we probably, knowing after
we did soil tests, those soils levels were
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate in phosphorus, they still put
phosphorus on, but we didn't want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are, so we just want to look at real
landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are real sites, not research,
typical research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had low-maintenance areas that were
primarily grasses, mostly mowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was not mowed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other was comparing a suburban
wooded area, deciduous tree area,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at runoff, and what was in
that runoff on his site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zach had, this was a three-year study,
so this kind of shows the three different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, a high-maintenance turf,
runoff collecting area, the
[SPEAKER_00]: low-maintenance area, and a wooded area
primarily with deciduous trees with the
[SPEAKER_00]: litter drop from those trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time there was an event, a runoff end
greater than a tenth of a millimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were collected, and on some of those
plots there were 127 runoff events in
[SPEAKER_00]: three years, and he measured dissolved
reactive phosphorus, nitrate ammonium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then be able to calculate mass loss
knowing the volumes of those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to show this as a
summary, mostly to tell you about season
[SPEAKER_00]: and two things, but first is the amount of
runoff in the first two years in the
[SPEAKER_00]: highly maintained turf site compared to
the wooded and low-maintenance area were
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly less, a third on this area
compared to the low-maintenance turf,
[SPEAKER_00]: and about two times less with the
high-maintenance turf area compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: wooded area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason is that type of dense plant
vegetation, a tremendous amount of surface
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting and root activity, earthworm
activity, high infiltration rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff is significantly less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I were a stormwater management
person, and I didn't put labels on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you showed me these things and said,
well, what landscape would you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce runoff and stormwater management?
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely would want something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a benefit that we don't always
think about in these landscapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a very significant landscape
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the creek that runs
[SPEAKER_00]: on Kendall?
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through Kendall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it goes through that residential
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little creek, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perennial stream and very flashy,
which it reflects runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a little bit of
precipitation, there'll be runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that stream is a very good stream
to study runoff, because it does quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: show what can happen in that stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not a very big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an interesting place, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is a very busy table,
so I'm going to try to kind of walk you
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had these three zones within
that watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The threes were the lower end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones, as we will see, had the greatest
amount of runoff, the most events,
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff events, and the amount of runoff
occurring on this is an average amount in
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of these runoff events.
[SPEAKER_00]: This middle section and then again on the
upper end had the lowest amount of runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: events and the amount of runoff occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highlighted the ones that were
significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in runoff, we had dissolved reactive
phosphorus, either the concentration on
[SPEAKER_00]: average, this is the average concentration
coming out of those individual events,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the total load of phosphorus
coming from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see in this lower part of the
watershed where there was the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of significant amounts of runoff,
we could see the fertilized turf areas
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the unfertilized or forested
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to call it a wooded area,
were significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the total phosphorus concentration was
also higher and the load was just
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly higher than only one of the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the middle and upper parts
where the amount of runoff was
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly less than those two areas,
both in amount and the number of events,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could see less phosphorus runoff in the
load of phosphorus runoff in that area or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least relatively equal in the upper
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dissolved phosphorus ones we could see
there were no difference between these
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes or if there was in one case it
was slightly higher, but the highly
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained turf was actually less in that
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Zach has concluded in this case
that if we kind of look at these sites
[SPEAKER_00]: with low to moderate potential for runoff,
and a watershed like that is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, this is a very good kind of
watershed to study that.
[SPEAKER_00]: High maintenance lawns had the same or
lower amount of dissolved phosphorus total
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus runoff compared to the
unfertilized turf areas or the wooded
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the issue was however when you get in
these high potential for runoff sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see with the high maintenance lawn
there was an increase in the loading rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of dissolved phosphorus likely from
fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a quarter of the amount of
the particulate phosphorus loss because we
[SPEAKER_00]: also measured in the sediment that came
off of those plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a reduction in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again that reflects back the high density
area that increases infiltration rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of particulate or erosion was
significantly less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same amount of total
phosphorus in the runoff compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: unfertilized and low maintenance areas and
wooded sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total P being slightly different than the
dissolved P. Usually dissolved phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: does relate back to fertilization in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened in that stream over this
study?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think that suburbanization is
likely going to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was shown that suburbanization in that
suburban part of the water said that the
[SPEAKER_00]: outflow, the stream had the same level of
nitrates, had higher ammonium levels
[SPEAKER_00]: likely from the fertilization that was
occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: More dissolved phosphorus during storm
events, not during kind of base flow of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher particulate loss, quote,
erosion than the undeveloped section of
[SPEAKER_00]: that watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is interesting to show that as we
kind of showed in the introduction to this
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can see suburban areas being a
source of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fertilized lawns, if they were to have
a lot of that watershed that's in a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: risk are more likely to have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have areas with really moderate to
minimal runoff losses, the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: itself has very little to do with what
might be coming off that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second student that kind of
followed on this was Mark Slavins.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was looking at a little different
version of landscape types and runoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Mark is vice president of
environmental affairs with the Scotts
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has been actually very good at
supporting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have somebody in these
companies when you need seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making some significant
contribution to some projects we've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to get some research money on
them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nice to actually get some product
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his objective in his PhD work was
trying to determine the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between lawn density and composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: On nutrient and pesticide loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had basically four kind of grass
type, perennial grass type lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four sometimes perennial but
non-typical kind of grass lawn types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had one with Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is basically had four of
these that were initially sotted with
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had nice plant density to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that after that point all it did was
to get mowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that we added fertilizer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizers and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilized pesticides and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going from intensity of minimal
maintenance other than mowing to the most
[SPEAKER_00]: intense one where we're adding even
irrigation into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically we put on, as it turns
out, a program very similar to what Scotts
[SPEAKER_00]: would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: A four-step program for your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were four applications with
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the pesticides that were in
those to control broadleaf weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf weeds and insect and annual
grassy weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be something if you went
down and bought a typical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you might see for a typical
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: High maintenance lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other set of treatments involved
either directly having other kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: weedy material in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth crabgrass and smooth crabgrass with
half turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plugged out half of this area and I
said, we, I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mark and my technician Jeff and
helpers did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you had a 50% at least initially
50% turf grass, 50% annual grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the annual ones, these were just
seeded each year to try to keep those in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A broadleaf weedy one that had very high
density in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one again we plugged in Kentucky
bluegrass sod initially at one to one
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf weed to grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were four replicates of these
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to do a typical kind of
residential suburban type installation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bulldozer was brought in,
removed all the soil, brought back and
[SPEAKER_00]: compacted with equipment like this to
simulate what you do when you build a new
[SPEAKER_00]: site and the top soil was put back on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did two sets of types of collections in
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had these two by three foot lysimeters
pushed in the ground, pulled out a bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: a PVC bottom put on and a drain line
coming out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the water that would be
infiltrating through the soil and leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: out would be collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are on the upper surface of these
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the slope is about a nine to 12%
slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a gutter collecting system so that
all runoff events coming from those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this is crabgrass,
not very much there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perennial broadleaf weed area and then
the straight Kentucky bluegrass next to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they looked like at
establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find from a leaching
perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that this is the volume of
leaching occurring over a two year period
[SPEAKER_00]: that except for one kind of plot,
most of them had a similar amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that period of time, there were about
1,100 millimeters of precipitation and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that we're seeing about some of
these ones, about a third of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation ended up leaching through
the soil, which is actually a pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: amount as compared to some others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what did things like nitrate look
like, concentration?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, and so this is the
nitrate mass loss over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we kind of look up here,
this highest one up here, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the one with one dash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark made these slides, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have probably made a little bit
different version so it may be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit easier to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see, and these are approximately
samples taken monthly, bulked together
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly and then analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that the worst one in this case
happened to be the one, at least comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: the turf ones, the one that was turf with
nothing else added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see, the one with the
highest kind of after that tends to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: turf with fertilizer and a little bit less
with the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after this kind of establishment,
even though these were sought,
[SPEAKER_00]: after this establishment year,
there were a couple peaks later on and it
[SPEAKER_00]: reflected that sometimes some treatment
was slightly higher than the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was always a baseline amount
coming out of these and sometimes ones
[SPEAKER_00]: higher, especially with the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk, we'll certainly show that
in runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what nitrate leaching looked
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now at the other plots, okay, the ones
mostly with weeds in it, the scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw before, I'm not, sometimes you can,
I wouldn't say skew different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the scale of the data is the same in
these curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see some of the worst ones that
we saw were similar to before was this
[SPEAKER_00]: first year peaking either say the second
set of samples back to about the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season if we were kind of
looking at periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that crabgrass and
crabgrass with turf grass in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the crabgrass and turf grass
one had losses similar to what we saw with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones with fertilizer fertilized up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These weren't fertilized at all after they
were established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we summarize the kind of losses in
this and if we look at that, the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: loss, we saw very little ammonium loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is typically we see in turf
studies that we don't see much ammonium
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you put ammonium based fertilizer,
it gets converted to the nitrate pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest loss was with nitrate and a
little bit of organic nitrogen coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an application basis, the one that we
put on that had turf with fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was equivalent to about 1.8% of the
nitrogen that was applied leached through
[SPEAKER_00]: that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the only one that was
significantly different than other
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments was the broadleaf one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never really had anything leaching on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was applied to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, these tend to stabilize over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of take-home message tends to
be that a dense perennial system,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's with grasses or broadleaf
weeds, are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is runoff and the total
amount of runoff that occurred over the
[SPEAKER_00]: two-year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if we look at these numbers,
we were seeing 400 millimeters with
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're down to about 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only about a tenth of what came on as
precipitation ran off these sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I would think is relatively low,
even though it's a very slopey area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see that areas with turf grass with
fertilization tend to get the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: runoffs less than some of the other
treatments, especially if we compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: crabgrass, which was the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though we put fertilizer and
pesticides, when we irrigated that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the amount of runoff jumped up
pretty significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that occurs, it wasn't the
irrigation itself creating runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it keeps soil and seed moisture
content higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then any precipitation can more likely
run off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there has to be a caution,
I think, in areas with irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run the risk of keeping soils more
likely to be produced runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the volume of runoff that
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about the amount of, in this case,
phosphorus in the runoff, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and ammonia?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of ammonia,
not related to treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some nitrate, again,
hardly relationship to the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was slightly higher amounts of
phosphorus in that runoff, but relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: small in the amount that was actually
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could see going from turf itself
with fertilizer, with pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason with pesticides,
saw slightly higher amounts of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: running off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with irrigation, we didn't see,
saw slightly less than what we saw there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the amounts are relatively
small, and that all landscapes lose some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what has always been my pet
peeve.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, well, let's just let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be better for the
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always some loss out of these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not 100% at retaining nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mark concluded from this, regardless of
the plant type, low plant density and high
[SPEAKER_00]: in seed moisture content were the greatest
factors affecting runoff volumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the need to maintain a dense canopy
is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennial canopy is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: An annual one, you could have crabgrass
being very dense in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the first frost comes in
September, October, November, whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be, you start losing plant
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those areas become quite leaky and
likely to show problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also concluded that the ammonium
and phosphorus losses in runoff were low,
[SPEAKER_00]: but increased with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relative amounts were relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, nutrient loading runoff and
leachate were less than 2% of the N and P
[SPEAKER_00]: that were applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen laws written around the
fact that we see 25% loss of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to turf areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts is a very prominent one,
likes to write land use laws around that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's no data to ever back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, again, as a scientist, you get a
little upset when you're making laws that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't based on facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the second one of the ecosystem
service stuff I want to talk about is soil
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorus runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might say, what the heck does this
have to do with ecosystem functions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was done with Doug Saldat,
did his PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's currently an associate professor at
the University of Wisconsin in Madison and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Soil Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went back to his home department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that have to do with soil
phosphorus and phosphorus runoff from turf
[SPEAKER_00]: and an ecosystem service?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things we, and actually I
got grants to do this, was to look at turf
[SPEAKER_00]: grass sites as a potential for taking
compost, especially animal-based compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: to remove that from a farm that has excess
phosphorus because of importing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can reduce their surface
phosphorus water quality problems and put
[SPEAKER_00]: on a large landscape like turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see there's a lot of interest
in using massive amount of yard waste
[SPEAKER_00]: compost in turf and residential areas as a
way to get rid of those as well as reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be, if you can retain all
this phosphorus in that system,
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be a great ecosystem service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, then this would not be a
very good system to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at, Doug looked at first
taking some long-term soil nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration sites we had worked on putting
phosphorus levels at different amounts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were four sites all across New
York going from the Adirondacks to Long
[SPEAKER_00]: Island that are fertilized at typical
fertilizer rates, not something that would
[SPEAKER_00]: not be typically done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were about twice as much of what the
soil test would require, but probably
[SPEAKER_00]: within more traditional range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in these sites we had, Doug did two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, he removed the soil, removed the turf
that was on it and looked at the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: that occurred from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is soil test level on these
individual plots versus the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus in runoff, the concentration in
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without turf there, you see a
pretty consistent increase in as you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the soil phosphorus level,
you're gonna see a corresponding increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the amount of phosphorus in runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty typical of kind of bare
or annual cropping systems where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see a pretty consistent and a very useful
tool then to look at reducing phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: levels to make sure you don't have excess
amount of phosphorus in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was this kind of this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens on the same plot with
actually turf on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turf would be growing to see what
that impact would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the exact same plots with
a dense turf grass on them, we see kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: no relationship between soil level,
at least in the range where we're raising
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus levels from typical
applications and the amount of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in that runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you kind of look at this,
where again, the New York state law and
[SPEAKER_00]: many other states, they do a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's adequate amounts on,
don't apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a pretty, our
recommendations are down here at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have four or more pounds of
available phosphorus per acre that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have sufficient, you wouldn't need to put
an application on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that could be
significantly higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not really see any major environmental
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there situations, however,
that we see soil levels get highly
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated from phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is back to this question
of using compost on turf and in
[SPEAKER_00]: landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to kind of expand it to the
landscape ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In turf areas, we quite often,
if we're going to apply a compost as a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil amendment, we're going to put a fair
amount on a quarter or a half inch
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we did it with a dairy
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show a slide of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work it in, and that's on established
turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a typical kind of rate that's
used to try to improve organic matter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, a better turf overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we calculated how much available
phosphorus that was actually putting on,
[SPEAKER_00]: a quarter inch was about 1,300 pounds per
acre of available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And double that if you put a half inch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where again, our typical fertilizer rates
that are about a tenth of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might expect, if we're putting on
these extremely high loads of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could have a potential for
phosphorus runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the actual plots look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we did the same kind of study that
we showed earlier that Doug did.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these are the ones we had
that we didn't put any compost on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were down less than 50 pounds per
acre of available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we started putting compost on,
you could see we could elevate these
[SPEAKER_00]: levels up to 500 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of phosphorus in a runoff
significantly went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, there is a big concern about
using landscape areas with high rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: compost application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if there are nutrient rich
ones, which are typically dairy or
[SPEAKER_00]: poultry, other animal based ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are two issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, that you can saturate the soil,
the soil's ability to retain phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you increase that risk of phosphorus
runoff pretty significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part is, there's another
kind of ecosystem effect that is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're gonna suppress the carbon and
nitrogen sequestration, you would
[SPEAKER_00]: typically get an area with less organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we start loading up our
landscapes with compost, two things could
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, if there are nutrients in those
composts, you could run the risk of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of phosphorus runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're certainly gonna reduce that
site's ability to sequester both carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen if you have a tremendous
amount of both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact, they'll probably be losing
those as that compost degrades and
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see carbon and nitrogen being
released out of that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna really retain very much
other than if you have above ground plant
[SPEAKER_00]: parts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last part I wanna cover on this
ecosystem part is carbon and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with Steve Resetti.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve was a PhD student over at Natural
Resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to be on his committee,
because he was doing turf work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's currently an assistant
professor at Hofstra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to BU for a Boston University,
that BU, for a post-doc when he left here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has a university position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did Steve do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Steve was working in the Baltimore
ecosystem study, long-term ecosystem study
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took soil cores out of residential
areas and forested areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 32 residential sites he worked
with and eight forested sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those forested sites were from the
Baltimore ecosystem, their long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem research studies that they've
been doing in this site for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, the ones coming from the
residential areas were primarily lawns
[SPEAKER_00]: with cool season grasses in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a few trees and shrubs in
the area, but the primary landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: feature where he was sampling was from
lawn areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he took one meter deep undisturbed
cores, broke them up into four zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looked at total nitrogen and carbon in
those samples, and by knowing the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: density, he then can relate back to an
amount on an area basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did Steve find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he found comparing residential to
forested, that there was more carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stored in those soils in both in
residential and nitrogen than forested
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of the carbon-nitrogen ratios
were similar in those, but the absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of carbon in the residential soils,
lawn soils compared to the forest areas on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same soil series, were significantly
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time sequence in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had sites that were as young as five
years, and the oldest one was about 45
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and he saw this kind of linear
accumulation of carbon over time and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen over time in those residential
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it would have been nice if he would
have been able to go on another 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: or so to see if this continues,
but there definitely was, over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: a fair amount of sequestration of both
carbon and nitrogen in these residential
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference occurred primarily in the
top 70 centimeters of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see with carbon, the 10 to 70
centimeter zone, this is where the major
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, significant increase occurred
compared to the four soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nitrogen, it's the top 70 centimeters,
even at the surface 10 centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had higher in the residential area than
the forested area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the percent carbon was slightly
higher, again, in the residential area
[SPEAKER_00]: than in the forested area at most depths,
except for the deepest sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a mass balance in these
areas, and kind of adding that up,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was able to conclude from this,
and I'll put his concluding statement up
[SPEAKER_00]: here, that these data suggest that soils
in residential areas on formal
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural land, so these were suburbs
that had taken farms over, had a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant capacity to sequester nitrogen
and carbon following development,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, they had data for 45 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the large area of these soils,
they are undoubtedly a significant in
[SPEAKER_00]: regional carbon and nitrogen balances as a
form of sequestration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final thoughts after 35 years being here,
plus, this was my first seminar 36 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago in December, and Bill, this is what I
want to point out, you see this rose?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a rose tie on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came in, the department I was in,
floor culture and ornamental horticulture,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of rose guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the reason I got this job is I
had this tie on, Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeez, most people do not see me without a
beard, so this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hair, those are two good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you young faculty that want to
complain about startup costs, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you got back in 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a $5,000 hatch grant, with inflation
is now $17,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dean said two years ago, the average
startup package for a faculty member in
[SPEAKER_00]: CALS is over $800,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you young faculty think you have it
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: No technicians, no post-docs, no grad
students, a whopping $5,000 a year in
[SPEAKER_00]: $17,000 in today's funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to remind you people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when I first came, we had mainframes
with punch cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no PCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smartphones, I had a party line phone with
two other faculty members in extension
[SPEAKER_00]: with a light on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that light was on, somebody's
talking on their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a guy, George Good, who was a nursery
landscape person, had more than 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 50% extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob Kozlowski, who was 100% extension,
put three of us on the same line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time that light went off,
everybody was grabbing for their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technology has changed over my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to thank people who I've worked
with over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first technician was Ron White.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you do know Ron.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a phenomenal engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a turf guy, but he was probably the
best engineer I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Gowan, Chris Sanchirico, Howard
Piddick, Jeff Barlow, my current
[SPEAKER_00]: technician back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left Alexis Hines off this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was an asset for a good asset for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some of my previous colleagues,
Norm Hummel was here on the faculty and
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe Angutidaria, who we still hire from
time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some more current ones, and I don't have a
picture of Jenny and Kyle Wicken,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of our people such as Frank and
Jennifer Grant in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And field staff and other IPM people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of great working with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the grad students are always the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the list that I was able to
work with over 35 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it just grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, maybe a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey is the most recent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania is right in the middle,
but I don't know where they've passed
[SPEAKER_00]: theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey is called the most restrictive,
but again, they all have that,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for phosphorus, have that similar
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were kind of two things in these
laws that were done.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they exempt organic fertilizers,
or fertilizers that had come from compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the other kind of caveats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, excuse me, eventually that
phosphorus or nitrogen is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, well, we produced,
especially municipally, produced all these
[SPEAKER_00]: composts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck are we going to do with it
if we ban it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they all would be banned under the
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they decided, OK, maybe there's not
really that much used, and it may not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But New Jersey, I think their law is
pretty good, but they all have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a twist to it, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I wish Frank were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Frank has done some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at a budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: His work, and he was looking mostly from a
golf course perspective, which is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most intense ones, because of
mowing and inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is net accumulation,
so that even though you do have to mow
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you have fertilizer, you have
irrigation, all those carbon versions,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do get the net accumulation is
greater than those inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's outweighed by those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an area that I think somebody
should do a lot more work in, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Frank had done a little bit of that
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a great question, because the
next study that was done, we're finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: up, did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we kept the traditional high-input
Kentucky bluegrass version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at low-maintenance grasses,
tall fescue and fine fescue, with and
[SPEAKER_00]: without clover in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was only maintained
organically with organic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the next generation of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the take-home is, after a while,
they all perform very similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They end up being low, because you do have
an establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that establishment period out,
once you get density with these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually in some of the years,
because we have three years, and I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the third year, but in some of the
years, actually the low-maintenance fine
[SPEAKER_00]: fescue with clover was the worst for
losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know whether that's just an
aberration or if that's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anything, the high-maintenance one
was not worse than those other landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's been the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you'll see regulations
written around that, use low-maintenance
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not always the maintenance that's
the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the density and what it does to,
really, the hydrology of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it changes that, it can outweigh some
of the potential negative things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a period, the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, turf is a good nitrogen sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus, it really depends what the
soil levels are initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put it on at a time when the
soils are wet, you could get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a management component to
that, for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to give another
seminar, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a more important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
