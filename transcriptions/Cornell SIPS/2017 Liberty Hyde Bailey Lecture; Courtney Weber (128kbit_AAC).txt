[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for everybody for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about berries now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people like berries, which is,
of course, a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to generally convince people
to eat them, unlike some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that maybe somebody else might
have been talking about recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the berry breeding program at Cornell
has been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the first breeding programs
at our station.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at the New York State Agricultural
Experiment Station in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't even know we exist,
which is something that's nice to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people that we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been there for a very long time,
and berries have always been a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our program is the oldest breeding
program in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty sure it's the oldest one in
the world, but it's kind of hard to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes when you get into the record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at the other breeding
programs around the world and you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: their records, our varieties are
foundational varieties all across the
[SPEAKER_00]: world in other breeding programs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We primarily work in raspberry and
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry comes in a lot of different
colors that most people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, red raspberry is what most
people are familiar with, but they also
[SPEAKER_00]: come in black and purple and yellow and
blush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've released varieties in all of
these colors over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the varieties you see in the
marketplace you wouldn't recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because berries aren't sold by name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sold by name to the grower,
but not to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people don't even know that
there are different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the supermarket, what do you
see?
[SPEAKER_00]: You generally see big red strawberries,
big red raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't realize because you don't
see varieties compared to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, if you see differences in the
supermarkets, organic and traditional or
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional varieties are different
varieties usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe you can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally, you can't tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry has worked hard to make
it so because informing consumers that
[SPEAKER_00]: every week is a new variety is very
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So strawberries are very regionally
adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the varieties that grow in California
don't grow well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones in Florida don't grow well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our varieties don't grow well in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think about the vast differences
in climate, you can imagine that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: these, you know, we don't see the same
trees growing in different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, berries are the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have varieties that are
adapted to where you live and where the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate and soils that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a little bit with blackberries,
and we're doing more with blackberries
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is growing availability and
growing demand for people to have
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the local market has been very sketchy
for us because of winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blackberries are not particularly winter
hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're working on varieties that
can grow in New York so that we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: local blackberries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't think New York when they
think strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they think California,
which, of course, 95% of the strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: come from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Northeast is the biggest region
for berry consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk to companies like
Driscoll's, the Northeast is their market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love to sell in the Northeast because
people like berries and they eat a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's at least four days by truck to
get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the berries in New York, for
strawberries, start right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in getting fresh
local strawberries, now is the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: start going to the farmers' market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the first fruit to hit the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers, it's really important for
growers in New York because they start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting people to come out to their farms,
to come to the stands, to see some fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, strawberries are very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves strawberries, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great way to start the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, strawberries are the third
leading fruit crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is an important crop for farmers in
New York as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nationwide, we're the sixth leading
producer of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, California produces about five
times more than the rest of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six is still a little bit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But California has pretty much peaked in
their production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acreage has actually started to go down
because they just don't have any more
[SPEAKER_00]: space for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some labor issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking for the possibility of
growing more strawberries in other parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country, including the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strawberries do very well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're native.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are strawberries that grow wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have a tradition of collecting wild
strawberries and raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they're very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little better to get them from a
farmer so you can pick them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, in the supermarket,
you have big red raspberries, big red
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have an interest in producing
big red ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a big red raspberry crimson giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit size of some of these can be the
size of a small strawberry, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really nice for pickers because
it fills containers really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So berries are what are called
field-packed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The berries you get in the container in
the supermarket were put in the container
[SPEAKER_00]: by the person who picked it from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one else touches it after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how fast you can get them into the
container really makes a difference for
[SPEAKER_00]: both the picker and for the grower because
they don't have to pay as much to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we like big red ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But competing with California big red
berries is most likely going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: losing proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their climate is so perfect for growing
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we need to have some way to
distinguish ourselves from the California
[SPEAKER_00]: berries you see in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we do that generally is with
flavor and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our, again, another big red
berry, but this is our Archer strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is a little bit softer than
what you get in the supermarket because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to drive four days in a semi to
get it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a big difference both in
quality and in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can pick them much riper and
they don't have to be so firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: People tell me, oh, the strawberries in
the supermarket, they're so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't taste like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the modern system of if you
want to drive it across the country from
[SPEAKER_00]: central Mexico in December, you've got to
have some firmness to get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we develop varieties that are not
that firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little juicier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can get to market in the same day
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really are very fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our growers can differentiate
themselves by having a product that tastes
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleagues at Driscoll's that I
know very well, some of them actually are
[SPEAKER_00]: my former students, they tell me in the
Northeast when June berries or
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries are coming in June in New
York, their sales go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is their peak season as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a company like Driscoll's can
notice that people are buying local
[SPEAKER_00]: produce, it does open their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are interested in having a
good quality product that is locally
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we're doing is working
with protected agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see on the top are what we call
high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are about 12 to 14 feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom we call low tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go over the strawberry plants just to
keep the rain off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a raspberry plant, a raspberry fruit
that's been rained on lasts about a day to
[SPEAKER_00]: two days in your refrigerator because it
has absorbed some of that water and really
[SPEAKER_00]: softens.
[SPEAKER_00]: A raspberry that's never been rained on
can last seven to 10 days in your
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference between two days and
seven days is huge when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf life for a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keeping the plants dry and keeping
the fruit dry is a big, big advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this year as the rains have not
stopped for us for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really has made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just started harvesting
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally in a year like this when
they've been rained on 10 or 15 times,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal load gets really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberries are nice and dry under
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't had to spray fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everything is looking really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the things we've worked
with my colleague, Marvin Pritz,
[SPEAKER_00]: has also worked on this quite a bit to
show growers in New York that we can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries and raspberries in very high
quality by doing some production practices
[SPEAKER_00]: that are a little different than that
we're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much even in California,
the raspberries are grown under tunnels to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now with this kind of technology,
we can have fresh berries in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere being grown from about mid-May
until mid-November to early December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't realize that you can
continue to get local berries well into
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the growers actually have
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't believe them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're picking raspberries in October,
and they're putting them on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't believe that they actually
came from the local field, and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate the grower there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the consumer, and show them pictures of
the field and the fruit being picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberries are an interesting crop
because big and red is what you see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we would like to do and what we
are starting to do is expand that palette
[SPEAKER_00]: to get people to think about raspberries
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry has been focused much more in
the last 10 to 15 years on having them
[SPEAKER_00]: available all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much now, though, you go to the
supermarket, strawberries, raspberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberries, blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there all the time year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now is the time where we can expand
that and start giving people some
[SPEAKER_00]: different choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big red ones are always going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at specialty ones that
come around seasonally, ones that taste a
[SPEAKER_00]: little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's yellow, blush,
black, purple, like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have varieties like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the flavors in those are just
outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now where you're going to find those
are in the local markets because some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers want to differentiate
themselves now from the other local
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and have a product that's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed a few varieties in
recent years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crimsonite ripens to that dark red
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine the juice and jam that you
make out of something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frozen product there is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really sweet flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blush one, we call that apricot in the
breeding world, but the best tasting
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It confuses people because it never turns
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you freeze it, it turns pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very interesting variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really interesting to the growers
as well because even if people don't buy
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they come over to their market just to
see it or to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they might just buy red ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts a conversation with the
grower and the consumer so they can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this is very interesting to the
gardening world, the home gardener as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, because they know more about it
because they've been growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up on a farm where we always
had a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gardeners like to brag to each other
about whatever it is they have that their
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this kind of stuff really brings a
conversation about what they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a purple strawberry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ripens to a red wine color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The juice is just as dark as you see on
the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're selling that through Burpee because
the homeowners are really interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor on that is just
outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't see that in the supermarket
probably for a while because nobody knows
[SPEAKER_00]: how to market it exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the home gardener already knows
because they know what tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that strawberries can
come in other colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's white strawberries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to see those in the
marketplace a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pine berry type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see that occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever go on YouTube and look at
white strawberries in Japan, you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: amazed at what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling them individually,
individual berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're packed in a nice soft
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell them as gifts on special
occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild what people will do if
they have too much money on their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growers are looking to sell and make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can have a specialty product,
why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll conclude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I will tell you, now is the time to
get your strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get to the local markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll be really pleased with
what you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
