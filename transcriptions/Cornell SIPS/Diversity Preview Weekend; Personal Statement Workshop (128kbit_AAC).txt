[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the personal statement
workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Erin Larson and I'm a
fifth-year PhD candidate in ecology and
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fourth-year student in ecology and
evolution working with telemedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and so we'll be talking a little bit
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about what we'll actually be
doing during the personal statement
[SPEAKER_00]: workshop but we'll spend about 15 minutes
talking to you guys about personal
[SPEAKER_00]: statements generally and then we'll break
out into our small groups where we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the personal statements that we read
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I'm going to take off my scarf real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will also have you guys do
some peer editing with each other while
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trading off talking with your grad
student editors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with I think a personal
statement is one of the most mysterious
[SPEAKER_00]: black boxy parts of a grad school
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the part where you're like what
exactly am I supposed to say here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to unpack a little bit
what exactly a personal statement is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys wrote one for DPW.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have written some if you've
been applying for grad schools this past
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally a personal statement is
somewhere between two to four pages long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the instructions they give you for
length and formatting and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really an opportunity for you to
expand on your CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those sentences that you want to
write about the different jobs you had,
[SPEAKER_00]: the different experiences you had,
some things that you didn't get to put on
[SPEAKER_00]: your CV if you want to explain why you
took some time off before going to
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrad, why you switched schools,
the personal statement is a great place to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of explain your CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a chance for you to show your
voice and your personality and who you
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of a picture of you as both
a person and a researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, it's not necessarily a place to
tell them everything that you like to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in your spare time unless it's really
related to how that would help you succeed
[SPEAKER_00]: in grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a way to show that you're
resilient, that you have grit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to have what it takes to
make it through the long road that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD or a master's degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of structure, there's sort
of a general structure that we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also might depend on the prompts
that you get given by a specific school
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll give you some really
specific directions of what they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see in a personal statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very generally, you obviously want to
have an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have some sort of narrative
hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of a hook might be an anecdote
from your childhood or from sometime in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lifetime about why you decided you
wanted to study biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep that pretty short and sweet
because really what you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into is your recent past in terms of
sort of the post high school, your
[SPEAKER_00]: influential classes, your mentors,
your research experiences, and then into
[SPEAKER_00]: your future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you're also
forward-looking as you move towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of that personal statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about why you want to go
to grad school, specifically why you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to grad school at that particular
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're applying to and why it's a
good fit for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to sort of wrap it all
up with some sort of forward-looking
[SPEAKER_00]: summary statement or conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can be a little overwhelming to
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys already have done that,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already have something that you can
work with and edit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to make sure that you know
your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know the department that
you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are professors doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the school like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a more agriculturally focused
school?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a school that focuses more on
theoretical biology, something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to know the strengths and
resources it has and why you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there and what about it is drawing you
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, like we mentioned before,
if they ask you specific questions to
[SPEAKER_00]: address, you want to make sure that you
hit those in your personal statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also want to think about what
have been your influential experiences?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's driving you to want to study
biology and to want to go to graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: school?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really shape your outline
around those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll finally craft a clear main
message with supporting information which
[SPEAKER_00]: is just as easy as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we'll talk about, too,
a little bit is how to actually kick it up
[SPEAKER_00]: a notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how to make sure that your personal
statement really shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to do is to make sure that you
tailor each of your personal statements to
[SPEAKER_00]: each school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have sort of your modular
personal statement that you've crafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then make sure that you're linking it
into each school that you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means thinking about specifically
naming professors possibly that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about working with or specific
resources at each of those schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want to make sure that this
piece of this document is in conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: with your research statement, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't mean that they totally
overlap, but you can mention some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same experiences that you mentioned in
your research statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe go more into depth about how
they developed you as a person and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher rather than specifically the
research that you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure that you get feedback on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be an opportunity for you
guys to get lots of feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But send it to friends, family,
professors, mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more feedback and the more drafts you
can go through, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cinnamon will talk in a little bit
about how helpful all that feedback can
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really let you shine through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to have some of your
voice, your personal experiences that you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel comfortable sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really be the hero of your own story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little hard to want to toot
your own horn, but this is the place to
[SPEAKER_00]: really be the active participant in your
narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that you give yourself lots
of time to actually go through all these
[SPEAKER_00]: drafts and editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though this seems like maybe the
thing that you want to do last when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your applications for grad school,
make sure you leave yourself plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to actually focus on this,
which you guys are in great shape for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now cinnamon is going to take us
through a motivating real-life example of
[SPEAKER_00]: a personal statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm going to show you is actually
two versions of a personal statement for
[SPEAKER_03]: the GRSP, which is a graduate research
fellowship program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first version was not successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not get the fellowship.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second version was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the thing that changed the
most in my application packet was actually
[SPEAKER_03]: my personal statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to take us through what I
changed between the first and second time
[SPEAKER_03]: that I applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just first some overall tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to tell you these tips and
then give you some concrete examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that's really important is to
be space-conscious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also you don't have to try to fit
in every life experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a personal statement, but they don't
need to know every step of your whole
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay to editorialize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also avoiding vague phrasing, which I'll
get more into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoiding cliches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Showing and not telling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one thing to say, oh, I love
biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another thing to show that you love
biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last, as Erin was saying,
it's really, really important to get help
[SPEAKER_03]: editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this difference between the first
and second versions wasn't just me sitting
[SPEAKER_03]: in my office thinking about how I can make
it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it was suggestions that I got
from mentors and other students that were
[SPEAKER_03]: applying for this grant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the overall intro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see in draft one, it's pretty
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one, I actually ended up
deleting an entire paragraph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the first thing I deleted,
so it's really tempting to start with a
[SPEAKER_03]: summary of what you're going to talk about
in your essay, but most of these are
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty short, two, three pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't need a summary up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be helpful to start with a summary
just to orient yourself, but you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: need to have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing that I cut a lot out of
was tracking my exact story through
[SPEAKER_03]: college.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started off in a different major,
and then I was like, oh, I want to study
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer, and now I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to study plants, and I'm going
to study frogs, and that doesn't all need
[SPEAKER_03]: to go in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is everything I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed this to one sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's OK to have the winding path,
but you don't need to recapitulate it
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else that I did a lot,
definitely, when I first started writing
[SPEAKER_03]: and that I've seen in some of the essays
that I was looking through, is this really
[SPEAKER_03]: vague and cliche opening sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually taken from my actual
essay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people will have some version
of, oh, from an early age, I was tromping
[SPEAKER_03]: in the ponds or interested in nature,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone will say this, so don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this second example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all sentences from the first
version.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this early engagement in nature,
which sounds really great, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what does that even mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last one is this fascination,
which led me to study biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, this fascination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty vague.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and so this is probably the biggest
change that I made in my personal
[SPEAKER_03]: statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Erin mentioned a little bit the
narrative hook, and this is where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really doing the showing and not telling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this idea actually wasn't my idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody else who had gotten the DRFT read
my draft and was like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is nice, but your first draft is
really vague.
[SPEAKER_03]: And could you give some sort of anecdote?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see this first draft.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're up in a rural setting, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I changed it into more of this story,
which I could read to you, or I can give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a second to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I did this dramatic reenactment
last year, so I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, all right, so here's my final intro to
my DRFT statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: 9 PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lying on my stomach in six inches of
stinky gooey pine left, and peering down a
[SPEAKER_03]: dark drainage pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hunched forms of Rana Kespiana,
the American bullfrog, visible but beyond
[SPEAKER_03]: my reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: A foot to your left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call to my field assistant, who's
attempting to startle the frogs down the
[SPEAKER_03]: pipe of the pole.
[SPEAKER_03]: She taps one of the frogs, and it hops
into my reins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurt hammering, I lunge to sweep it into
my net.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand triumphant, grinning ear to ear,
mission accomplished.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a story from my most recent
field season.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is me at nine years old, although not
much has changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the field assistant is my younger
sister, the mission to catch the frog for
[SPEAKER_03]: show and tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously an example from my
childhood, but I've also seen this done
[SPEAKER_03]: successfully with other types of stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a class that you took.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a question that you think
about a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw one really good example where I was
going through some of your statements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody is really interested in invasive
species, and so the process of realizing
[SPEAKER_03]: that organisms that they really loved as a
kid are actually invasive organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it doesn't have to be exactly like
this, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another nice thing to do is if
you start with some sort of example to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of weave it through as you go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I showed you earlier the sort of vague,
oh, early exposure fascination,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I linked it back to these actual
concrete things that I would then go on to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about in my research statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So meatability, watching the drain pipe
fill with water and then drain,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is when you could see the frogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interconnectedness and diversity with all
the animals of the pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to go this route,
it's really nice to tie it into actual
[SPEAKER_03]: concrete ideas and things that you want to
study in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last thing, which we are
really hammering home today, is it is so
[SPEAKER_03]: important to have somebody else read your
statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see these are three
different people that I had read my
[SPEAKER_03]: statement between the first and second
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of red, a lot of deleted
things and added things, but this is super
[SPEAKER_03]: important and don't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a personal statement, so it can feel
kind of uncomfortable, but it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something else, oh, yeah, it's also
different from a college statement,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I was talking about at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really have to make sure it goes back
to ultimately what you're interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: pursuing in graduate school, which was
what Erin was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a last point that I think has
come up a lot is how to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people will have something
that came up for them personally or
[SPEAKER_03]: academically that is affecting grades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's OK to talk about those things
in your personal statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good opportunity to explain any
sort of adversity that you face.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of pointers on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to be brief, if you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to go into the situation so
much that you're cutting out a discussion
[SPEAKER_03]: of your research interests, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also good for the purpose of a
personal statement to be generally
[SPEAKER_03]: positive and forward looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I think we're going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take questions, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are going to have,
oh, sorry, you can clap for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a little bit of a
brief Q&A for you guys, but also keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that you're going to be meeting one
on one with two grad students who also
[SPEAKER_00]: read your personal statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a question that you feel
like is a general one from this that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be helpful for a lot of you guys to hear
about, that was a time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll break out into those
smaller groups.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was this idea of,
like, if you get conflicting information
[SPEAKER_00]: about, like, oh, this anecdote's great
versus, like, oh, this anecdote sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea, too, that, like,
the people that you're applying to might
[SPEAKER_00]: have differing opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way that I would think about
getting around that is really do your
[SPEAKER_00]: research on the school and the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Cinnamon's example is awesome of
her narrative hook, but that's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, the only way to do a narrative hook
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different ways to open up
in a way that kind of draws the reader in
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be something that feels
natural to you and your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if writing about catching frogs with
your sister in that way doesn't feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would be very genuine to
you, then it's not like a prescriptive you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to start your statement this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a whole range of issues that
come up, like, for instance, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about something.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my case, it's very hard to talk about
coming back to school with an older
[SPEAKER_01]: student and why I switched careers without
involving the disability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no trouble talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people are happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people are like, what a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that gets to the idea,
too, of, like, the explaining difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: situations, but making sure that you keep
it brief and that you keep it towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the idea of the personal statement
is that you're spending a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: time looking backwards and reflecting,
but you're using that to drive,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's what I'm doing next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is what's motivating me to move
forward and to go to grad school and to
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed in grad school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much just like, oh, I'm looking
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not a therapy session.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're kind of trying to take away
the main lessons that you learn from each
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in a way that's looking forward,
which can be a really tough bounce to
[SPEAKER_00]: strike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this explaining situations,
I had something that affected my grades.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my first draft, actually, there's a
paragraph on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had someone that was like,
oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, like what Erin's saying,
being positive and forward-looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also getting other people to look
at it to see, oh, does this strike you in
[SPEAKER_03]: an OK way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I presenting it as, oh, this is
something that shows that I am really
[SPEAKER_03]: resilient and really dedicated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this something that is like taking
away from the rest of my, or like drawing
[SPEAKER_03]: attention away from the rest of my
application?
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting feedback on that is also
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's repeat the question real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was, this was for my GRFP
and then asking if we had to include our
[SPEAKER_03]: grades for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we did include a transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a transcript.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gets back to what Erin was saying
about reading the instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's actually, I went back and
looked at my actual grad school app.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of variation in what
different universities will ask for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them do like a combined personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the GRP does a combined personal
statement with research experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are both together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other universities will have like a
statement of purpose separate from a
[SPEAKER_03]: research statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some just have one statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to read the directions
for the specific university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm teaching freshman writing right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot express enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it OK if I swear?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crappy first draft is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so much easier to start with a
crappy or maybe not so crappy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not quite right for this
particular thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to start with a crappy
piece of writing and then edit it to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: the next thing than it is to be like,
blank page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to write like five pages about this
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen in editing and what
you guys applied with for your personal
[SPEAKER_00]: statement is a place to start for grad
school applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, I know some of you folks
have already applied with the personal
[SPEAKER_00]: statements that you sent us, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to start with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of move paragraphs
around and expand more on one point if you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to lengthen, add in a new idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's better to start with something to
edit than to start with a blank page in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of cases.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of having your letter writers
go into some of the more detail about an
[SPEAKER_00]: adverse experience you had or a couple
semesters or however whatever came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because keep in mind, too, that this whole
thing is a whole package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the personal statement is one point of
that package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's OK for some things to be brief in
some places and to be expanded on in other
[SPEAKER_00]: places as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's also a good practice to send
these statements to your letter writers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think we're going to need to just
time-wise move out into the editing so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get time with your grad student
and peer advisors or editors if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: any other questions or lingering things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
