[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Nina said, I'm going to just talk a
little bit about my drear experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said Impatients and Vegetables is the
title, but it ended up being a whole lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll see how much I can kind of cram
into 40 minutes and still hopefully have
[SPEAKER_00]: more room for other things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get started, though, this was one
of the coolest disease phenotypes I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tomato necrotic ringspot virus on
chili pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a whole population of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them look like most disease
plants, but there was one genotype that
[SPEAKER_00]: had this just really unusual phenotype
from the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, I have to preserve this for
posterity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking you through my three main
internships that I wrote the drear for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tropical Vegetable Research Center in
kind of central Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chia Thai Company in western Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Prince of Songkhla University in
southern Thailand, just north of the
[SPEAKER_00]: border with Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a little bit into some of the
side trips I did as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cut some of them because there
was a lot of traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to kind of give you an idea of
some of the horticulture that I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced while I was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people asked me where Thailand
was, so I thought this would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of primer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another kind of source of
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people also asked me why I was
interested in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things is Thailand has a
really strong agricultural sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a lot of government support for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The royal family has poured a lot of
personal money into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've set up kind of what they call the
royal projects, which are kind of specific
[SPEAKER_00]: projects to kind of push the boundaries of
agriculture within Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to say that they're
self-sufficient for all crops except
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually seen any figures to
support this, but it's something they like
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly because of the range of
climates within Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the northern part, you have temperate
areas where you can grow things like
[SPEAKER_00]: cherries and apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the country is pretty
tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow things like rice and pretty
much any other sort of tropical food.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did try growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met with the wheat breeder a few
years back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said they could grow it during the
middle of their winter in the coolest part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, it was a complete flop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do grow barley, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a huge brewing industry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really a big hotspot for
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 100 native impatiens species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you all, I think, know I did my
PhD on impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a genus of 1,300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty good chunk of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also tons of other families.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Zinjib or Aca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, lots of towns have two or three
native species that they use in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking that adds kind of different
flavors and spices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of fun to be like
walking around and seeing all these
[SPEAKER_00]: species that might be really, really local
to that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice climate, good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those weren't my primary reasons,
but they certainly didn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I have some personal history with
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ex of five years was Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak a little bit of Thai from being
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been to Thailand twice before,
which kind of fed into a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: internships that I have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first internship I did was with the
Tropical Vegetable Research Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was at Kasetsart University at
their Kamping San campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to put little red dots on the
different areas that I went to in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is about two hours west of
Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kasetsart University is the premier
agriculture university in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their main campus is in downtown Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their Kamping San campus is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They refer to it as resort-like,
which I think is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lots of bodies of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the drainage canals are populated
with water lilies and lotuses and canas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really beautiful campus just to
be wandering around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happened to be there during the
Loikrotan Festival, which is they build
[SPEAKER_00]: these little altars out of biodegradable
material and put them on the water to
[SPEAKER_00]: worship one of the water goddesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really neat way to kind of see
floriculture in action there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of my favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a banana flower that they peel
back and pin to itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they use banana stem in the
middle and put gumafrina or globe amaranth
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you light incense and candles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iksara, the tropical honeysuckle,
is a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I saw all sorts of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, they'd made them out of
different materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's kind of an eco-friendly
twist to it so that the fish can finish
[SPEAKER_00]: them off and they don't end up clogging up
the waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it gets pretty crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was towards the end of the festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, just one university.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into downtown Bangkok,
I mean, the entire canals and rivers are
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged with these different kind of
floating altars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and there was a rhinoceros beetle
crossing the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Tropical Vegetable Research Center
is a national organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a lot of confusion with the AVRDC,
or the World Vegetable Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even more confusion because
they're right next to each other at the
[SPEAKER_00]: company center.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a distinct organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a few different mandates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germplasm is one of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do a lot of outreach work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real eye-opener for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've lived in the tropics before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just a huge, incredible
diversity of species that they work with
[SPEAKER_00]: and work on maintaining and improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like this is a relative of black
pepper that was a popular spice before
[SPEAKER_00]: chili peppers were discovered,
gac fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relative of bitter melon that you
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You eat the arils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're high in carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lots of plants just growing
spontaneously around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wild Naomi that's used as a
vegetable in parts of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use it with a chili paste and eat it
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can use a pot herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of this as an ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them outside the Cornell store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to see them growing here as wild
plants is really mind-boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, they do a lot of outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We led several tours for classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one teacher from a high school
group climbing one of the trees to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: down fruits to distribute to the students.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of students, especially as
urbanization goes on, are getting less and
[SPEAKER_00]: less in touch with the rural roots and
some of the indigenous knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do a really great job in their
indigenous vegetable garden, which I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on in the next slide, trying to
educate people about some of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs and vegetables that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruit was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bilimbi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of you know it,
which is incredibly sour from oxalic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never eat it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone was excited just for the new
experience of it, I think, more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, they have the indigenous
vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually what it originally
attracted me to the TBRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty nice garden on the edge
of their research facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was there before, it had been
just in the planning stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they've really set it up into
distinct areas based on the different
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand has the Northeast area,
the North area, Central area, and South.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have kind of theme gardens based
on those regions now, each with their own
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of herbs and their own vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasenai Chaipech was a master's student
when I was there about seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now the head of germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has an encyclopedic knowledge of
every single plant within that garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd go and we'd pass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could tell me the Thai name and the
local dialect name and how you could use
[SPEAKER_00]: it for food and what you used it for
medicine and scientific studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, he's eating the petiole of
one of the taro relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just lots of unusual plants and
unusual uses for plants that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a torch ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd seen it in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used as a cut flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice because it lasts a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Thailand, it's also used in soups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has kind of a gingery, tangy flavor to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also eat it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little fibrous, I think,
to eat fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in soup, I think it's pretty tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could have it as kind of a dual
purpose that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their main claim to fame is their pepper
germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have over 200 varieties of chili
peppers that they've collected with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, since peppers are new world,
but kind of neutralized varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've put them into different market
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done lots of breeding work and
lots of characterization as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two big issues for pepper production
are diseases and then insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've developed one variety that's
pretty much immune to insect predation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the insects that are a problem in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're breeding for anthracnus
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of sorting of different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are insect damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the edible ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking data like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have three or four different species
that have been distributed within
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a duplication of the
AVRDC's chili pepper germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 3,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't grow all of those out,
but they do grow out the Thai ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also do some seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a ghost pepper breeding project
that they're working on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was one of the things that I
thought was really interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: since it's not a crop that we see in the
US that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Roselle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hibiscus relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the taxonomist you ask,
it might even still be a hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have tea and the tea turns red,
typically it's because they say it has
[SPEAKER_00]: dried hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Thailand, it's used fresh instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crop that hasn't received a lot of
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the breeder, Mao, did a cross between
these two varieties and got a huge range
[SPEAKER_00]: of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whites, pinks, peaches, short,
tall, all sorts of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting as a crop also
because it inhibits aspergillus growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are trying to capture that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as good with the red one,
because it dyes everything red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some interest in using one of
the white varieties for things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also put it out and dry it
to see what it's like for creating
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really neat seeing the scope of
variation they've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was there, they also had their
annual Cassette Fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that means agriculture in Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a huge event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe they put it on every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the course of one week, they had half a
million people come to the campus and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew up this entire garden within the
course of two or three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of hanging vegetables and
different herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to kind of use things that we think
of as edibles in a more ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: application, which was really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were taking selfies all over the
place and wandering around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a great experience for people
who wouldn't get to grow the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also sold seeds of some of the
varieties they developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a pure seed initiative
to try to kind of make sure the farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to good quality seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was there, my big thing was
brewing tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to introduce people to kind of
native Thai herbal mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prepared one from Thunbergia lorifolia,
which is used as an ornamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is used as a detox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the kind of way that we talk about
detoxing here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually like a detox.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be used analogously.
[SPEAKER_00]: With activated charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they say, if you're drinking it,
don't take medicine because it'll absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also been some really good
scientific studies on delaying of diabetes
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms and improving liver function,
which diabetes is a huge problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting chatting with folks
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also sweetened it with stevia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevia is not a native Thai herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of interest in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold out of our stevia plants within
the first day or two because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really kind of interesting
way of interacting with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also run into several Cornell alums.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Prasid and Rujira Diwatanawong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prasid did his master's in entomology
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rujira did her PhD in horticulture a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's T.
[SPEAKER_00]: Habanada, who I never actually met when he
was at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was apparently in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a professor at Kasetsa at Camping
San.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fun chatting with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the fair takes over the entire
campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could give a whole presentation just on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tried to encapsulate some of the
more interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a huge orchid show as part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm used to orchid shows in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you can grow them in the tropics
and have the ideal weather for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale just becomes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: An onsidium tunnel, a mochara tunnel,
and then all of these incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: installations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about maybe a fifth of the whole
setup that they had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also have some more
traditional judging things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had orchids for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price-wise, you can buy what would be a
$40 Banda orchid for about $6 there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Collector's Nepenthes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the rarer ones they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rarer species was $6 compared to what
you'd pay in the US of like $60,
[SPEAKER_00]: $70.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had airplanes for $0.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lest you think it's all plants,
they also had animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was from their cattle breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing a lot of work trying to
introgress good genetics into the
[SPEAKER_00]: land-based varieties in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also did some work with chickens,
which I don't know a lot about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know my advisor is a big chicken
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd throw the slide in.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I finished there, I moved on to
Chiayi Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiayi Thai is a Thai-owned and run
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a base that has expanded to have
a market throughout most of Southeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: South Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have huge market penetration within
India and in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work on a really wide range of
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this, I'm realizing I left off
two or three in addition to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do research, but they also do
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've also started branching out
into agrochemicals, because that's the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that most companies seem to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into too much detail,
because it's a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, proprietary and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did take a few photos while I was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually one of three
cucumber breeders there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went out and met with some farmers
who'd been growing bitter melon varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were interested in trying some
other varieties from the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of gave them seeds,
talked with them about their growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a household name within most of
Thailand, but they're not really well
[SPEAKER_00]: known outside of Thailand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's partially a brand thing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a really interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an alliance with Takai,
but I don't know the details of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got little hints and bits here and
there, but very hush hush and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two main stations within
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gantanaburi, where I was for most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Western Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most people from the US may
have heard of Bridge Over the River Kwai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget how we pronounce it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of what the area is known
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the hottest, driest areas in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was there during the hottest and
driest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a nice area, very picturesque,
lots of youths and plateaus and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a tourist area.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much there besides tourism and
large expanses of kind of unpopulated
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've managed to make melons into a
kind of major crop within the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone I talked to in Thailand before I
started this internship said, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: try the melons in Gantanaburi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've sort of created the market for
them within the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a small sales area at the
research station to kind of build on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have things like melon chairs to
kind of keep people interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really uncomfortable because
they're made of concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people love taking photos with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you drive back from Gantanaburi to
Bangkok, you'll see melon stalls all along
[SPEAKER_00]: the road the entire way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's become such a huge part of
the reputation of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their other research station is up in
Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiang Mai is much cooler than Gantanaburi
or most of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a separate kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also has a different culture and
slightly different dialect because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow a lot of crops up there that
you can't grow in most of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a photo of this because instead of
using black plastic mulch, they use leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: debris and put it down individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a more eco-friendly form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to explore the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming a huge tourist trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of movies coming out
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are kind of flocking there
by the dozens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still has an incredible flower
market where I got to see kind of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: hot and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the kind of traditional
Thai arrangements of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of garlands that are placed on altars
or hung from your windshield if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: more modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But seeing different kind of combinations
of flowers, which is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was also visited by some folks from
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll skip about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I finished with Chiayi Thai,
I moved down to southern Thailand to Hat
[SPEAKER_00]: Yai, which is in Songkla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like right above Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hat Yai has sort of a bad reputation,
unfortunately, with most of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bombing there a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the Thai people I told I was
going there had never been there and joked
[SPEAKER_00]: about dodging bullets and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see a single gun the entire time
I was there, which is very different from
[SPEAKER_00]: the US in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also felt incredibly safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting area because
it's near what used to be a port town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a lot of cultural exchange,
a lot of ethnic Chinese that came in about
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it was also a separate kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of interface with a
local Muslim community that had been part
[SPEAKER_00]: of that kingdom as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really well known for good food
culture and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the professor I worked with,
Acharn Parkpum Panichai Yupakaranan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really well known within
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacognosy is the study of making
medicine from plants, which I'd never
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of before I came there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a huge field.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has grad students from all over the
world and ongoing exchanges with even more
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: He spent a month in Hawaii while I was
there doing some other research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a really interesting insight
into kind of academic culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of extractions of marigolds
and ginger and other things trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate out different compounds and then
test testing on sometimes animal models,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes cell models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a really different
experience than what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also ran into Adirak Rukong,
who did his PhD here a few years back and
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated in horticulture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now a professor doing a lot of the
farm program there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the undergrads who start in
agriculture or anything related to that
[SPEAKER_00]: are required to spend their first semester
working on the student-run farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow all of these different
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have no background in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see them taking selfies as the
cabbage gets larger and larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they take it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're sitting there trying to sell
you on their cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really cool experience getting to
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was kind of intrinsically involved
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The area is really nice, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of near the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of beaches and other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the emblematic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mermaid, kind of like the one in
Copenhagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Naga statue, which is one of
the mythical creatures in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got to explore some of the wetlands
nearby, which was really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know Thailand had wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went to one of the biopreserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things they had in kind of
payment for us getting a tour was they
[SPEAKER_00]: asked us to replant a field of palm trees,
the old-fashioned way, using a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the students, these were
pharmacy students with no background in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone was really excited to sit
there and pound the stick into the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the palm trees, which was really
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there with a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a post-doc from India,
Ahmad and Faisal, a grad student from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also got to try pure palm juice
while we were there, where they cut off
[SPEAKER_00]: the tip of the nail and fluorescence of
the palm, collect the sap, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had palm moonshine, which they
were Muslim, so they didn't try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took their share instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredibly potent, but very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see it catching on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research work there was doing leaf
resin extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that I pitched to Achen Park was
looking at impatiens for different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, specifically naphthoquinones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Impatiens produce chemicals very similar
to the ones in henna, so they can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: for dyeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have methylated forms and
other forms that aren't found within
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawson, which is the plant that henna is
extracted from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were looking at them and trying to
see what we could do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dried leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of the henna tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one growing there, ground up,
and then extracting in methanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporating it, and then running
thin-layer chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a whole new experience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I'm much more of a
whole plant person, so this was a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a hard time with the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran both HPLC and TLC, and we would get
conflicting results about we would find
[SPEAKER_00]: henna compounds in impatiens, but not in
the henna.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still some stuff that we're
kind of sorting out, but we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about maybe doing that down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find a whole bunch of compounds
that hadn't been described, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's some really interesting work for
the future, and it could also be addressed
[SPEAKER_00]: for conservation work for some of the
native impatiens species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took quite a few side trips while I was
there, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were mostly around Bangkok.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things, since this is mostly a
plant crowd that I wanted to point out,
[SPEAKER_00]: is Bangkok, despite being pretty
metropolitan and developed, has really
[SPEAKER_00]: made an effort to create green spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is outside one of the bougier malls
in Bangkok, and it has a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: planting of ground covers, grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a green wall nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the second floor of a metro
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've really made an effort for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the eighth floor of another mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've built an entire outdoor garden
with waterfalls and all sorts of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really kind of neat seeing how
they kind of pushed the green into an
[SPEAKER_00]: urban landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some obligatory temple shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really a religious person,
but they're pretty great and ornate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a Chinese temple that was in the
middle of one of the Thai temples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge Buddha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like two or three stories tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have other photos of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really interesting cultural
experience for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the side trips I took in Chiang Mai
was to the Queen Sirikit Botanic Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a chance, it's an incredible
garden to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there mostly because Ek Suksetan is
one of the world authorities on impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a ton of research work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's named countless species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he runs a lot of their research
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden itself is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a canopy walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, Chiang Mai is a slightly
different climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to see a whole different range
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a rose garden, which is not what
I expected to see in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have cultivars that are really
well-adapted to the climate there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of people taking selfies with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermilion house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a terrestrial orchid breeding program,
which I thought was really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear a lot of work going on in
Thailand about dendrobium orchids and
[SPEAKER_00]: banda orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've done a lot of work with this
is Calanthe and also Phaeus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that I think is kind of
on the cusp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ek was sort of complaining, though,
that he wants to push impatiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he said orchids are always considered
so much sexier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get all the funding money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, that'll change in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find a ton of different impatiens
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was everything that was a small
selection of what was in flower at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have just an incredible variety of
them that Ek and other researchers have
[SPEAKER_00]: collected from different parts of Thailand
and the surrounding area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Kingdung wartii from Myanmar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Christogamous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower is never fully open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all of these just growing within
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ones that form caudixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of woody sort of bulbules type
things at the base of the plant to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hang on through drought regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that was neon blue that
unfortunately wasn't in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they had photos of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said one of the hard things from
a conservation point of view is they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the funding to really keep the
accessions going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just kind of whatever grows kind
of keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they keep hoping it'll persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in talks right now with the New York
Botanic Garden and Stribing Botanic Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Francisco to see if we can get some
conservation work going on with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just an incredible experience
from that point of view, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a side trip to Taiwan because my
visa ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And met up with a Jesneria breeder who I
knew from the US, Wei-Kwang Lin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now working at Bayer out in Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he kind of showed me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never been to Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a lot of use of green space there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a park that's, I think,
two years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've completely turned over what was a
slum before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a bike trip through the middle of
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really worked on kind of building
up green spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hiked to the top of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it was near the beginning
of Chinese New Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone was hiking to the top of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a really great experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, again, it's an interesting
intersection between Chinese culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So orchids being utilized in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also went to Malaysia because it was a
really quick hop from southern Thailand to
[SPEAKER_00]: Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And met up with two Cornell alums from
food science, Adi Sikin and Tengju Tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both professors in food science
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get into some of the botanical
gardens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, again, I could go on and on and
on about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Tengju works at a university next to
the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went and visited him there and
explored the plant life and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: beaches a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also went around downtown Kuala
Lumpur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I was surprised at some of the
use of plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are irises and ornamental grasses
that they keep alive throughout the year
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't in bloom at this time,
but I'm told they're really spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: when they do bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the entire inside of the
mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, there's two main botanic
gardens that I visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: One inside Kuala Lumpur and one about an
hour south near one of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchids are becoming a really big thing in
Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a push to compete with the
Singaporean market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And arandas, which are descended from this
one, this is a arachnus species,
[SPEAKER_00]: have become kind of the go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, while I was there,
there was some construction going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they kind of had a nice twist on it
and paid artists to create these murals on
[SPEAKER_00]: the areas that were under construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like when the commons were under
construction, they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that were in flower were really
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had heliconia species I'd never
seen before at a putrajaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them were more kind of walking
gardens than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I did see, and I haven't seen
this as much in US botanic gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: is they had a whole chart on how to read a
plant label, which I think is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets overlooked a lot, but was really
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in English and Malay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw a lot of people stopping and
looking at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had this at the different entrances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really kind of enhanced the
experience for people who were visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll finish up here with Singapore.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know,
Singapore is this teensy little island
[SPEAKER_00]: right off the end of Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a city-state,
and it's one of the economic powerhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: of Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also managed to maintain a pretty
green presence, despite being a
[SPEAKER_00]: city-state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of about five or six gardens I
saw in their airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have a dendrobium orchid that
they've named after the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really devotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have artist stations outside these to
teach kids how to draw flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really neat ways of engaging with the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Singapore is also the only country in
the world that has a hybrid as their
[SPEAKER_00]: national flower, which is Paptheolanthi
misswakeen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it used to be called Vanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the Vandaceous types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Singapore Botanic Garden,
and it is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around since the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really well-established.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an orchid breeding program
that's, I think, at least 50 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not older than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've registered thousands of orchid
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They maintain one of the few chunks of
native rainforest within Singapore,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was just spectacular, and have a lot
of theme gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was captivated by the evolution garden,
because I thought that would probably lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to all sorts of outcry in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seemed to be a really well-done
garden there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tree is featured on the back of some
Singaporean currency, so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: integral to Singaporean culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had a banana and ginger garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never seen a banana like this before
and was just so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should have these all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then orchid fountains as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I did find really
interesting, but I thought was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: odd, is they had suggestions about,
oh, this plant would be great for home
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping, or, oh, this plant could be
used in this sort of arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Singapore, there's almost no garden
space, because it's mostly in apartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was a great effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be something maybe
areas with more of a footprint for the
[SPEAKER_00]: housing could really appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also went to Gardens by the Bay,
which is the other botanic garden there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full disclosure, I just accepted a job
with them, so I'll try not to wax too
[SPEAKER_00]: eloquent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are unique in that they're one of
the few gardens that has a conservatory
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Singapore is right on the equator,
so they cool both of the conservatories to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow temperate-type plants so that people
in the tropics can see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to kind of build themselves as
kind of creating a sort of central park
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the center of what will be the
downtown business district, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own several properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really neat architectural
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, they call the super trees,
which are obviously not trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've put in a lot of epiphytic
plants to kind of create that same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a lot of crosswalks at
different levels to see different things
[SPEAKER_00]: through, which I thought was really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the conservatories is called the
Flower Dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has kind of seasonal changing exhibits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funding is amazing, and so they bring
in huge amounts of tulips, huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: dahlias from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there, the first time I think was
around the Chinese New Year celebration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had just a huge field of dahlias
in the middle of the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second time was Tulip Mania,
and they had tulips all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selfie stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The garden is geared more towards people
who don't have a background in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture, and they're trying to kind
of bring people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it wasn't like some of the
other botanic gardens I've been to,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's very kind of much more about
like, oh, this is a botanical gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot more spectacle,
but kind of trying to attract people with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and then kind of teach them whether
they liked it or not kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also had brought in five full-sized
palm trees from Chile, several
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand-year-old olive trees from Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a really incredible
undertaking, and the garden's only three
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I think they said they had over
eight million visitors, so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other dome is a cloud forest that
they've built inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has several waterfalls and then also
walks going around different parts of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think, seven stories tall,
and mostly focuses on epiphytes and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, but I found an impatient
species and was really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the middle of one of the ponds,
though, and so I kept leaning over,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get a better and better photo,
and finally managed to get pulled back
[SPEAKER_00]: before I fell in, but it was right in the
middle of the carnivorous plant area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I thought was really neat,
too, and they, again, they try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a whole display of stalactites
and stalagmites that they've imported and
[SPEAKER_00]: geodes to kind of, you know, add to kind
of the feel to it, but people seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside gardens are really nice as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of water features because it
is by the bay, and it's it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brackish water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now mostly freshwater, and then it's
also become a very popular spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: sportsmen, so as I mentioned, they're kind
of creating a Central Park vibe,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of joggers go through,
and if you get there at around six in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening when the workday ends,
you'll get like almost a traffic jam of
[SPEAKER_00]: joggers kind of jogging through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotten to the point they now actually
have a host a marathon to kind of channel
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different restaurants around the
area, as well, to kind of accommodate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's kind of a sneaky way to
introduce people to plants, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get to see things that are
flowering at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'll just finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people had asked me about tips for
applying for the drear, and so I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just mention a few things,
if any of you are interested in applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I think that really is
important is having a focused theme or
[SPEAKER_00]: plan for your proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard several times,
and I think the committee told me,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, you know, making sure that you
can really definitively say something
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than, I want to go to Thailand,
you know, just kind of like saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is what you're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I think outlining your
internship with the folks at the place
[SPEAKER_00]: would be really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak from kind of my own personal
experience here, where I didn't outline
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things, and it was like,
oh, you want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the person who would do that is out
of town, so kind of making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's kind of planned out before
you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out your visas early on so you're
not leaving the country every month trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to renew it, like I did for the last four
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, use it as an excuse to travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write your reports well in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something I struggle with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take lots of side trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of felt conflicted sometimes about
like, oh, I'm in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be doing more of this and more of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also would say, you know,
it's important to take some time off to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there were times where you just
kind of sit in a coffee shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the fact that you are where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't have to be feeling
each moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'll thank the Dreher
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so, so much for this incredible
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really life changing, and not just
because of the job offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just totally been eye opening in
so many wonderful ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank my PhD committee,
since they helped me kind of get pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: through the last part of it and really
held on to kind of hold me to it to get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd like to thank the people at
the different organizations who were kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of in charge while I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamnan Sankoon, who is the head of PR at
the TBRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supat Mekianon, who's the head of plant
breeding at Chiayi Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Parthoom Thanichaiyupakaranath,
who is the professor at Prince of Songkhla
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all were just really welcoming and
were really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll take some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something I saw as a souvenir and
just thought that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
