[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to talk to you about is
what I see as two very major issues where
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular can play a major part,
that through innovations, I hope I can
[SPEAKER_00]: convince you that at least scientifically,
we can play a major part in feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and fueling the world from plants by
2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a number of social barriers,
acceptability issues, which we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to overcome and may be the
larger challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of my talk will be on the science
and why I think these goals are
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like parts of Cornell,
Illinois is a large part of my talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
what's going on in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and what's happening in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil samples have been taken every year so
we can look at changes in soil properties
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was Professor Morrow when he was
setting these plots up almost 150 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So proud of the fact that, like you,
we have alumni who are World Food Prize
[SPEAKER_00]: laureates, Marydale Clinton and Rob
Fraley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who I think importantly were awarded the
World Food Prize for their work on
[SPEAKER_00]: bioengineering of crops, which is perhaps
quite a change in awards and maybe telling
[SPEAKER_00]: us about the role of new technologies in
moving food production forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to look at are really three
issues, addressing food security and the
[SPEAKER_00]: global change and as Bob said at the
beginning, I'll be talking a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow about global change and adapting
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the issue of whether we can have
bioenergy without conflict with food
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll finish briefly talking about
some of the barriers as I see them to
[SPEAKER_00]: moving these opportunities forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So addressing food security under global
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at, I apologize, this is data
for 2013, but that's the most complete
[SPEAKER_00]: global data we have at present.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the most important crops in
terms of productivity of primary
[SPEAKER_00]: foodstuffs, then today maize is number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 1,000 million tons produced in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people stood up at the back,
there are lots of seats here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come and sit down because standing
up is a good way to keep awake during my
[SPEAKER_00]: talks, but it's uncomfortable on your
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please feel free to come and sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maize over 1,000 million tons,
rice next, very closely followed by wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: and then soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A somewhat distant fourth, but of course
soy is an extremely important source of
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary protein, both in animal feeds and
in of course food for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States plays a big part in the
production of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we only have a 10th of the world
area devoted to maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we produce over one third of the
world's maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce about a third of the world's
soy and a significant part of the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the United States remains the biggest
exporter of these primary foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens in the United States is
actually very important for costs of many
[SPEAKER_00]: of these foods globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, with all that production,
why should we be concerned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the United Nations Food and
Agricultural Organization report looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward said, well, by 2050, we're going
to have a third more people on the planet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they are going to be far more urban
than they are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing rapid urbanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diets in urban areas are historically
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use more processed food, more animal
products because people have a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you put those two things
together, more people and different diets,
[SPEAKER_00]: they estimated that we'd need 70% more
primary foodstuffs by 2050 than we have
[SPEAKER_00]: today, 30% more by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there isn't that much more
land that could support these primary
[SPEAKER_00]: foodstuffs, that would have to be achieved
by making more per hectare of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we able to meet this requirement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we look at what has happened
historically, so this figure goes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see what appears to be a fairly
steady rise in the yields of wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is average global yields of these
crops per hectare of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that for both of these
crops, it's more than doubled over that
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly 60-year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we project that forward,
we'd say, well, by 2050, we'll increase
[SPEAKER_00]: this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we actually look at how much we
need of these crops, then we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: following this trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, we're not at the present
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this is beginning to go
forward into the costs of these primary
[SPEAKER_00]: foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if we look at wheat prices
back in 2006, about $130 per ton,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the end of 2013, they were $360.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know everything has come down in
price since that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is at the beginning of March.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still $312 per ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is considered to be a low in
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAO estimate that we're probably going to
see a doubling of food prices,
[SPEAKER_00]: primary food prices, on a seven-year
cycle, given present trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we don't really feel that impact very
much, because these primary foodstuffs are
[SPEAKER_00]: really a very small part of the cost of
our household budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in, of course, some parts of the
world, household budget, 60%, 70% of it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on basic foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they double in price, that is a
catastrophe for those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of this problem is that we
aren't really improving yields year on
[SPEAKER_00]: year the way we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the percentage increase over
previous decades, China, India,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Indonesia are the biggest producers of
rice in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at their improvement in yield
per hectare, then in the 70s and 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: when dwarf cultivars were coming in from
the Green Revolution, yields were
[SPEAKER_00]: improving 40% per decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go forward now to the last decade,
we're now into single-figure improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is despite the fact that countries
like China are spending 100 times what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were in the 80s on rice improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more and more effort is needed,
and yet we're not getting the same return
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, there's a fear that rather
than going on a linear trajectory,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're actually getting into a stage
where we're seeing a flattening out of
[SPEAKER_00]: yield improvement year by year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, part of this may be impact
of global change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it may be that we're just reaching
biological limits on some aspects of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another study which was
looking at wheat yields through the world
[SPEAKER_00]: where some areas are showing improvement,
but many, the yellow, are showing
[SPEAKER_00]: stagnation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And red is where yields have actually
collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, wheat, over the last decade,
the average yield of wheat per hectare of
[SPEAKER_00]: land has not improved at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why might this be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we do so well in the Green
Revolution and now we're struggling today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll only put up one equation,
and this is a simple equation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to use it to explain why this
may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a given variety of a crop,
what is the maximum yield it can achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: at a site if there are no pests and
diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving it the nutrients and water it
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why might yield potential, improvement
in yield potential, be stagnating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we look at what determines yield
potential, first of all, it's the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of sunlight that's available during the
growing season of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it's how good is that crop at
capturing that sunlight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly, how good is it at converting that
captured sunlight into biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how good is it then at partitioning
that biomass into the parts of the crop we
[SPEAKER_00]: really care about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grain of rice, the seed of soybean,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are some numbers for a modern
soybean cultivar growing on a university
[SPEAKER_00]: farm where we've measured radiation
interception.
[SPEAKER_00]: We followed the growth of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we find is that actually the
interception efficiency, this is visible
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation because photosynthesis only uses
visible radiation, was 89%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 60% of the biomass ended up in the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about sort of putting a
seed in the ground, it's got to cover the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, really these figures are pretty
remarkable already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to see we can make them any
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our crop is going to have any more,
if it's going to have some seed pods,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have some stems to hold the
seed, then getting much better than 60%
[SPEAKER_00]: seems unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this in particular is what we really
changed in the green revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many pre-green revolution rice and wheat
cultivars had a partitioning efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30% or a harvest index of 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, they're around 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interception efficiency has been improved
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are perhaps theoretical maxima
for interception and partitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we achieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at conversion efficiency,
which is largely photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that falls far short of the maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we appear not
to have improved in breeding for improved
[SPEAKER_00]: yield potential in crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we know that if we did improve
photosynthesis, we get any more yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the evidence we have for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was something I was able to set
up when I first moved to Illinois in 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called it a face system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what these rings do,
and this was really to investigate global
[SPEAKER_00]: change, is that this green you can see
here, I call it a ring, but it's really an
[SPEAKER_00]: octagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pipes release carbon dioxide
according to wind speed and wind
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the wind is coming from this
direction, then CO2 is released so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: is blown across the ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the higher the wind speed,
the more CO2 we release.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about a year of engineering to get
this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we can elevate CO2 to what we
think will be the level in 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the apparatus in as soon as we've
sown the crop, and we keep it in place
[SPEAKER_00]: until the crops dried down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we remove the apparatus so we can
bring in small plot combines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we achieve within plus or minus 10% of
our target for pretty well 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the engineers managed to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within here, you've got elevated CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, carbon dioxide is a limiting
substrate for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So photosynthesis, carbon dioxide plus
light plus water gives you carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is limiting, so if you give it more
CO2, you get more photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this give us more yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us 25% more photosynthesis,
and it gives us about 16% more yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean, about 12% more in rice,
15% more in wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that if we can boost
photosynthesis, we can get more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we put this back into our equation,
we can see conversion efficiency has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't measuring photosynthesis,
it's measuring the amount of biomass we
[SPEAKER_00]: get per unit of light captured by the
plant, and this ends up in significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this since the year 2000,
and we routinely see these yield
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I don't want to give you the
impression is that, well, rising CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: good because that's going to give us more
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rising CO2 causes a lot of other problems,
including rising temperature, order of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation patterns, all of which are
going to impact our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've found many things that wouldn't
have been predicted without doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the expectations was that as CO2
rises, pest damage to crops would go down
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's more carbon and less
nitrogen, in theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect pests have to work harder to get
the nitrogen they need for their proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the biggest pests of
maize in the Midwest, the western corn
[SPEAKER_00]: rootworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is in the fall, it will come
into the soybean, it will feed a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on the soybean and lay its eggs ready
for the next crop because it's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean maize rotation, which this pest
has adapted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'll lay its eggs in soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thinking was, well,
this would be less of a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, IPCC actually put that into
its report.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in several publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apparently, these insects are
illiterate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they didn't know what they were
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was actually in elevated
CO2, they laid twice the number of eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you combined rising ozone with
rising CO2, the situation was even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my colleague, or colleagues Evan
Deluci and May Berenbaum looked at some
[SPEAKER_00]: other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, they found that Japanese
beetle damage doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insects live longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce more young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same was true with soybean aphid
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many unexpected impacts of
rising CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did show is, well,
if we can boost photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders really don't seem to have managed
to select for more photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little variation in
photosynthesis in the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we intervene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we, perhaps through engineering,
get more photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, I'd say, very timely because
it appears to be the only remaining way we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get more yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can obviously improve disease
resistance, agronomy, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of genetic yield,
potential, it looks like the only one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those three things we have left to
improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the process in a great deal of
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most studied of all
plant processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know every step of the pathway,
every gene involved, every protein
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, how they're assembled,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have high-performance computing,
which can allow us to simulate the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process in silico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crop transformation is becoming
increasingly routine, even in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give you sort of an
example of that in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that my former student
and now collaborator, Jing Wanzhou,
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted when he was doing his PhD was to
take all of the hundred-odd steps of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic process and then describe
them as a series of linked differential
[SPEAKER_00]: equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, after two and a half years
of work, we were eventually able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: this to start delivering something that in
silico looked photosynthetically like the
[SPEAKER_00]: response of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing you can then do once you
have that is you can then say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, OK, we're now simulating... Imagine
this is like a car production line.
[SPEAKER_00]: With many different steps, you can now
simulate the whole thing in silico,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can say, OK, I have 100 workers on
my production line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should I be investing those 100
workers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can then do is apply an
evolutionary algorithm, which basically
[SPEAKER_00]: takes one step at random, takes away a
worker or adds on a worker, and sees
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it makes any difference to the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, 99 times out of 100,
you just make it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every so often, you get one which
makes it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep that one, and then you go through
the whole process all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I do like to say about
this is we always say it's not rocket
[SPEAKER_00]: science, but in this case, we could say it
was rocket science because what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do is numerically integrate a
system of over 100 linked differential
[SPEAKER_00]: equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it's called a stiff
system because some things are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: very rapidly, others are changing very
slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person here, Eric de Sturla,
was a mathematician who was working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics of balancing NASA rockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently, that is a stiff system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd found algorithms for dealing with
these stiff systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we worked together with Eric to
actually solve this problem in simulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthetic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use his algorithm to the present
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a part of what the in
silico simulation was telling us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are looking at enzymes involved
in carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the plant has taken up carbon
dioxide, the processing of it and the
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration of the carbon dioxide
acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really stuck out, this is a
logarithmic base here, was that it said
[SPEAKER_00]: this enzyme, we should have 10 times more
than we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you come to the talk tomorrow,
I can tell you why we think that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that then raised the question is,
well, if you elevate this, do you really
[SPEAKER_00]: see more photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should say this is where it sits in
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the point, Rubisco, the enzyme,
most abundant protein on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one that fixes carbon dioxide in
plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that is reduced to carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's an autocatalytic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's adding carbon all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon is coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is draining off as sucrose and
starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest has to be recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SBPA sits in this recycling phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a key enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from reducing the enzyme that it
can slow down photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you increase it, can it give you
more?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from my colleague in England,
Christine Rains, that put this into
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are her three different events
with elevated SBPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is her untransformed material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Christine showed that in the greenhouse
in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we collaborated with Christine to
put it back in the field in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tested in our face system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, in the field, we were able to
get more biomass produced by just this one
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really, as Bob mentioned,
we've been looking theoretically at many
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways in which you might be able to
boost photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of years ago,
we were lucky that the Gates Foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: had been reading what we'd been writing
and sort of said in a roundabout way,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how about we put our money where
your mouth is and you show us whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: can really do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're using tobacco as our test bed
because we've got ideas coming from many
[SPEAKER_00]: different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put those constructs into one
cultivar of tobacco, regenerate those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put them out into replicated
field trials to really find out which
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulation might give us more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just show you one of these that
we've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is joined with Chris Naoki's group at
University of California, Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we showed in theory that if during
the day, the upper leaves of a crop get
[SPEAKER_00]: more sun than they can use, so they have
to dissipate that absorbed sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it will actually become toxic
to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't dissipate that sunlight
energy, they start to bleach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the leaf does is it then
brings in a quencher of temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: so molecules which can basically convert
that absorbed light energy into heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it harmlessly loses that energy as
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the leaf goes into the shade,
for example, of a cloud, and now light is
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting, it's still dissipating that
energy as heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes about 30 minutes to an hour
for it to recover and regain its
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we showed from a modeling perspective
that this could lower productivity by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris Naoki sort of read our paper and
said, well, I think I've got a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sent us his constructs, we put them
into tobacco, and we checked that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologically what we thought they
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows that they're recovering so
this shows that they respond far more
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly than the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could also pick those out with
fluorescence imaging, which is another way
[SPEAKER_00]: we can look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then most importantly, when we put
them in the field, this is really what the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I should say though,
all of these plants, if you boost
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, initially, you see a
response which is much better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: final yield because during the exponential
phase of growth, it's like compound
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get 1% more, that's compounded and
the plant's growing faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the canopy closes, that compound
interest no longer applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, these plants were,
the biomass was about 25% greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're quite excited by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got others coming through this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to move on to bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically in that segment, I think that
there are biotechnological ways that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could have a second green revolution,
but it is biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioenergy has attracted a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, now what we're hearing is,
well, hey, we're producing as much oil as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US doesn't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know I have two grandchildren and I
wonder, what is it going to be like when
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to have a lifestyle like we
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is oil really going to be as cheap as it
is today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we, as I believe, going to find this
is really devastating for our environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have to wean ourselves off of
fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those things hit, then we really do
need a bioenergy strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be realistic, to produce
significant amounts of biofuels from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, it's not going to be there
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want something in 20 years,
we need to be starting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shouldn't be looking at the
situation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be looking at the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally feel, and this is a paper
that Chris Somerville and I published in
[SPEAKER_00]: Science a while ago, that really Brazil
has been a model of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the rest of the world, sugar cane in
Brazil was in decline because the world
[SPEAKER_00]: decided it now had plenty of artificial
sweeteners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was less demand for sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using corn for making high
fructose corn syrup, probably not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but it was competing with sugar
from sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brazil's sugar cane was in decline,
as was the US's, as was the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had a crisis where they
couldn't afford gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to make ethanol from sugar
cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really haven't looked back since
they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012 was the first year in which more
gallons of ethanol were sold on four
[SPEAKER_00]: courts in Brazil than gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed they've also been exporting in
some years as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've managed to do this by really
reoccupying abandoned sugar cane land and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also moving now on to some fairly low
grade pasture and managing to restore that
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really isn't competing with their
food production in any significant way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, Brazilian government has
now mapped out where you could grow sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've really ruled out areas that
require deforestation, competition with
[SPEAKER_00]: food crops, the Amazon region,
the Pantanal region and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this land is really around Sao
Paulo state, where of course they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest demand for liquid fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take that nearly 64 million
hectares and you look at how much ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: could be produced, that would be about 15%
of all global liquid fuel use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would make Brazil, if you like,
the Saudi Arabia, a second Saudi Arabia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with the advantage that they have a
sustainable and renewable and apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: indefinite, if you like, oil well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we, in the 48 lower states at
least, we can grow relatively little sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: cane, although I'd say we're
underutilizing the areas where we can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Hawaii, which was a big
sugar cane producer, has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: abandoned land, as does Puerto Rico,
that could be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course what has come onto the scene
now is cellulosic ethanol, where we could
[SPEAKER_00]: make ethanol by digesting down cellulose
and hemicellulose to release the sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: and ferment those to ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed we're seeing the first
commercial plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poet has its first commercial plant in
Iowa, which is using corn stover to digest
[SPEAKER_00]: the cellulose down to glucose and the
hemicellulose down to pentoses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's now using that for ethanol
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we think beyond our food crops,
what this opens up is the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: use almost any plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives us an idea to reimagine
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a wish list of what our ideal
crop would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a C4 plant because C4 plants
are more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have a long growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will recycle its nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need nutrients to make ethanol in
our feedstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely different to a food
crop and be productive on marginal
[SPEAKER_00]: non-arable land where it won't compete
with food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to show you why food crops
are really not well suited to this task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're very proud of the productivity
we get out of our maize plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look at their use of,
this is the course of solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how much the corn crop gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also grow winter wheat, does a good job
of capturing this early season radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then misses all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennials generally do a better job
because this is a poplar and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: willows are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already have reserves so that when
temperatures become warm enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can expand their leaves very quickly
and do a much better job of capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a grass, Miscanthus giganteus,
which really fits these specs very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say there's something I've
worked on for 30 years, most of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, where actually that table I showed
you is not new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something we came up with in the
first energy crisis over 30 years ago when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were asked by the European Commission
to look at this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is when I moved to Illinois,
this student or now a professor in Iowa
[SPEAKER_00]: State, Emily Heaton, was in my classes and
said, well, I want to try this plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this is the most we've seen,
but this particular crop, was 60 dry tons
[SPEAKER_00]: per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the biggest yields of anything
in the Midwest in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I'd grown it in England previously,
and this is in kilograms per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared, multiplied by 10 to get tons per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a harvested yield of 20 tons per
hectare, which is pretty well a record for
[SPEAKER_00]: Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big advantages of these
perennial grasses, if you just want the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, is that they move their nutrients
into the shoots as they grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the autumn or fall, they move those
nutrients back into the perinating organs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you harvest them late fall or early
winter, you're leaving the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, a Rothamsted in England now
this has been grown for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now added nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do add nitrogen, they don't
see a yield increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very sustainable crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our trials in Illinois where
we're harvesting them late winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We compared it with switchgrass,
which has been a favorite bioenergy crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: but generally the yields we obtained with
switchgrass were quite a bit lower than
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Miscanthus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that's not to say that
switchgrass doesn't have a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just showing biomass accumulation
over the growing season for Miscanthus and
[SPEAKER_00]: for switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important thing is that Miscanthus is
putting a lot of biomass into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've now got farmers interested in
this for restoring their soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, Champaign County gets some
of the highest maize yields in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my graduate students,
Frank Doleman, now works for Monsanto,
[SPEAKER_00]: was curious about is Miscanthus really
better than maize?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found it was indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason was again, if you look at
solar radiation over the growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what a modern maize cultivar is
capturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what Miscanthus is capturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because Miscanthus produces
functional leaves earlier and can maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: them later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it captures about 60% more
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at the amount of
biomass plotted against interceptive
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, that tells us the efficiency
with which these crops convert the
[SPEAKER_00]: intercepted sunlight into biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this is maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Miscanthus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lines are almost identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference is really that
Miscanthus can just do it for more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can do it in colder weather than maize
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it isn't just that you can get a good
yield in central Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the European trials we
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on the west coast of Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on land which historically we know
has never been plowed, never been used
[SPEAKER_00]: apparently for a food crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and yet that's a 72 horsepower tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is our Miscanthus crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can grow on marginal soils very
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fernando Miguel, who's now also a
professor at Iowa State, was a postdoc
[SPEAKER_00]: with me, developed a mechanistic model a
very detailed model to really predict
[SPEAKER_00]: where we might get good yields in the U
.S., rain-fed yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it isn't just on
these fertile soils of the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also through into much poorer soils in
Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, Tom Voigt, a colleague of mine,
Tom Voigt, an agronomist now has trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: There which seem to suggest that that is
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what could you do with this in terms of
bioenergy in the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much land would you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is these brown areas are the
areas that we now use for our primary,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, maize, our row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of it, of course, is in the
Midwest, Mississippi Valley, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: right out here in the central valley as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this land, if you had drawn this
map 100 years ago, a lot of this land
[SPEAKER_00]: would have also been in row crops,
including parts of western New York state,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are not today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of land which has dropped
out of productivity, production that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take this square as the amount
of the United States that we use for row
[SPEAKER_00]: crops today, 176 million hectares out of
almost 1,000 million in the 48 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 17% is in row crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much will we need to reach this goal,
which was to produce about a third of
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid fuel production?
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquid fuels we need produce about a
third of them by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a crop like Miscanthus, you would need
9.7 million hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 11 million in CLP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it doesn't just have to be
Miscanthus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also think of crops like agave,
which can grow on semi-arid land as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd need more hectares, but we have a
lot of semi-arid land which is really in
[SPEAKER_00]: quite poor condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it degraded by early settlement,
where you could even restore soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really wouldn't be a large burden on
the amount of land we would need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have the situation where
producing about 110 million tons of pulp,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is declining in its need because
we're moving more and more to media like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand for pulp is declining, although
apparently some uses are still not going
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have those opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to finish on biofuels by saying
that there are opportunities beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: cellulosic ethanol as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: ARPRI, which is a branch of the Department
of Energy, put out a call for some
[SPEAKER_00]: high-risk proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together with Brookhaven National Lab,
University of Nebraska, and University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, we put together a proposal where
we said, well, sugarcane and sweet sorghum
[SPEAKER_00]: are among the most productive plants we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposing we could get them to accumulate
oil in the stem instead of sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you would get far more oil per
hectare than you could get from canola or
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set about trying to do this and
it was a test of concept, but in two
[SPEAKER_00]: years, we've managed to get accumulation
of oil in the stem of about 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've identified late stem promoters to
attach the constructs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also engineered photosynthesis
in these plants to get more productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a separate line has been hybridizing
sugarcane with Miscanthus, their close
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try and breed in, improve cold
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these, the engineering ones have moved
quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This obviously requires a lot of
back-crosses before you can really get
[SPEAKER_00]: back your original cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, sorry, I realize this is too small
to see, but this is how much biodiesel you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get per unit of land area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we get today from soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you can get from the cane we
have now with 5% oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you get if we reach the
theoretical target.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the sugar ends up in oil, which would
be about 20% of the biomass in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this map, what you're seeing is
yellow is lamb, which has been abandoned
[SPEAKER_00]: from agriculture, but could be used for
growing sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to grow an oil cane like
this on that land, it's about 23 million
[SPEAKER_00]: acres, about 10 million hectares,
that would be about 69% of that 2030 goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd really say that it is possible for
the United States to produce a very
[SPEAKER_00]: significant amount of biofuel renewably by
2030, definitely by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not possible by 2050 if we wanted
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, a lot of what I've been
telling you is transgenic technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is inhibiting us really from
adapting this?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is doubt that we really need to worry
about food production because Malthus was
[SPEAKER_00]: a vicar in Britain over 200 years ago who
showed mathematically populations rising
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially, yield is rising linearly,
a point will come when starvation happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He forecast that point about 200 years
ago, and we've managed to avoid him pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did reach a point before the Green
Revolution where it did look iffy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that was overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been overcome because we've had a
series of agricultural innovations of
[SPEAKER_00]: which the Green Revolution was won.
[SPEAKER_00]: We forget that going back 150 years ago,
the Haber process, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: basically originally coal was burnt to get
temperatures where you could convert
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia,
the source of most of our nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers today, probably allowing about
four billion more individuals on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put it to you, if the Haber process
was invented today, would society be
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to accept this dirty technology
despite the huge impact it's had on food
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, today we have the
availability of information and
[SPEAKER_00]: disinformation, which makes communication
of science critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think GMOs are really a classic case
where there's been a complete failure in
[SPEAKER_00]: communication because anyone with a
reasonable knowledge of plant genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: will realize that taking one gene and
putting it into a known location in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome is a much safer technology than
what we were doing before, which was,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, for example, taking a wild
relative to get a gene for disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, productivity, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossing that into our crop, then
back-crossing several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get our known gene in, but we also end
up with many other genes whose function we
[SPEAKER_00]: often have no idea about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be allergens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could even be carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we class that as natural and
acceptable, yet the far more precise
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is really not gaining much
acceptability, at least in many areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, at the same time, pretty well all
of today's insulin comes from genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified organisms, and somehow that's
been accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it isn't just our failure
to communicate to the electorate at large,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Florida became worried about
new bioenergy crops potentially becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it passed a law saying that if you're
going to trial one of these bioenergy
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, you have to take out a bond of
several million dollars in case it
[SPEAKER_00]: escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a clause in the legislation
which says, but if you're using the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for agriculture, you're exempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to a biologist, it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a plant's going to be invasive,
it's going to be invasive whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the California Low Carbon
Fuel Standard, which would not accept
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol made from maize, but will accept
ethanol made from sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a year when Brazil ran short of
ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It imported ethanol from the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California imported ethanol back from
Brazil because that was considered
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, some molecules of ethanol
are different to other molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are seeing things changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the opponents of GM crops have
changed their position quite an out
[SPEAKER_00]: proponents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I put to you is from a scientific
perspective, we could have it all in 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the policy in society will allow us,
will the perfect be the enemy of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: in this situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to know more about these
projects, there are two websites,
[SPEAKER_00]: RipeIllinois.edu and PetrosIllinois.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the many people
who've worked in my lab and made it
[SPEAKER_00]: possible for give that presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
