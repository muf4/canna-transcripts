[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell and I'm
with... I'm Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a vegetable pathologist at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we're at a cucurbit field,
and this is specifically cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, what do we have here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does this plant look like they are
wilting or dying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this this plant is dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's try to figure out what the issue
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can see that there's just a lot of
browning of the leaves and it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: look healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's a lot of wilt as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look around the plant,
you'll also see some of these bright
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow cucumber beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sometimes those beetles have stripes,
black stripes on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they have spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the spotted cucumber beetle and
the striped cucumber beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of them transmit a bacterial
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of the disease is bacterial wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of the bacterium is called
Irwinia tracheophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do all the beetles can have the bacteria
in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see one beetle, I will have the
disease in my cucurbit?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, the the bacterium,
the bacterium is inside the beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the beetle feeds on the plant,
that's when the bacterium moves into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and gets into the veins and clogs
the veins of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beetles actually overwinter in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a really cold winter,
more get killed off and you won't see as
[SPEAKER_01]: much bacterial wilt the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's a warmer winter, then,
you know, you won't lose as many cucumber
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles in in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll be a much worse year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every cucumber beetle will have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as one plant gets infected,
then other cucumber beetles that visit it
[SPEAKER_01]: can pick up the bacterium and spread it to
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Chris, you mentioned that the colder
weather is the less cucumber beetles we
[SPEAKER_00]: will see because they will get killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are things like plastic mulch or any
other type of mulch that provide like
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer temperatures will help the cucumber
beetle to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, most most people will pull
up the plastic mulch in the winter anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, you know, plastic mulch is
actually great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with raised beds and plastic
mulches with cucurbits is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you can see right here, the the fruit
fall off of the plastic of the raised bed
[SPEAKER_01]: and they end up, you know, in in the lower
area where they might be sitting in water
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a real wet summer like we've had
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Chris, as you also said that cucumber
beetles feed on the plant, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific part of the plant that they have
to feed on or is in order to transmit the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so they don't they can they can feed
on any part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times you'll see them inside the
flowers, and that's not going to be where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're transmitting the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll they'll you know, when when they
get into the the vein tissue, that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to transmit the bacterium
into the vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be a leaf, it can be a stem,
it can be the crown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be any any part of the cucumber
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes in a cucumber plant,
actually, you'll see like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: half the plant is really wilting and the
other half isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably because the cucumber
beetles fed on one part of the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacterium hasn't gotten to the crown
or the other side of the plant yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of the crown, do you mind if I
pull this up?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that you can tell the
difference between bacterial wilt and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the other root rotting diseases is that
you'll still have fairly decent roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look here, you know, when I pulled
it out, there's there's still a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: root system in this incredibly wet soil
because it's been very wet this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were Pythium, you might see the
roots be really, really degraded and the
[SPEAKER_01]: outer cortex might slough off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it were perhaps a Fusarium,
they might be kind of pinkish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, what you see is that the
crown just is looking incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can break it open, you know,
sometimes it'll even look yellow or watery
[SPEAKER_01]: on the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a, you know, a sign of
bacterial wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a classic test for bacterial wilt is
that people will cut the plant at a crown
[SPEAKER_01]: or at a stem and put that stem into a
glass of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a minute, you'll actually start
to see the bacteria streaming out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about this poor plant,
it's like its veins are just completely
[SPEAKER_01]: clogged with the Erwinia bacterium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that if you put it in a glass
of water, the bacteria will just start
[SPEAKER_00]: streaming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this how the plant looks like whenever
it is just starting off or we will see
[SPEAKER_00]: like what will be the earlier symptoms
that we see and that we can detect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the earliest symptoms are going to be
wilting.
[SPEAKER_01]: With bacterial wilt, it doesn't get quite
as yellow as you might see with a disease
[SPEAKER_01]: like cucurbit yellow vine decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get nearly as yellow and you
see wilting first.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is that on a hot summer day,
you might see wilting in the afternoon and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the next morning it doesn't look
wilted at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think, oh, it was just hot out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants got wilty and, and,
and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a first sign of bacterial
wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing it could be is that
there's a disease phytophthora caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora capsicii, whole different
type of pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can also attack the crown and
cause that same symptom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be really tricky to
differentiate between some of the many
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases that we have on our cucumbers
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what will be your recommendation
whether to diagnose the disease and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: management thing that you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you know, do the, do the put the
stem in the glass test to see if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial streaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also send, don't send the
whole plant, but you can send a portion of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, say from the roots up to maybe
a foot to your diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can tell you really relatively
quickly if it's bacterial wilt or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of control strategies,
controlling the cucumber beetle is really
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be hard to do in a year when,
when there's a lot of beetle pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another researcher at Cornell is doing a
super cool study that looks at using low
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnels that are maybe this tall to cover
up the plants when they're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way it's, it's like a row cover,
but it gives the plants a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: height and they're called meso tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually prevents the cucumber
beetles from getting to the plants when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're young and that's when they'll do
the most damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited to see what Dr.
Sarah Pethy Ridge finds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there also some varieties that are
like less attractive to the beetles maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plant breeders have been working
really hard to find, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are resistant to the beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, to my knowledge, there hasn't been
any resistance seen to the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterium that's in the veins of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is resistance to the beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's absolutely true that cucumbers
and melons are more susceptible to this
[SPEAKER_01]: disease than the other cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because maybe the cucumber
beetles are more attracted to these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want more information,
you can look or reach out to the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
