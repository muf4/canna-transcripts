[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you, Cathy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a most wonderful introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel kind of embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think I had done those things
that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am, as Cathy said, I am an expert on
taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a systematist, and I work on naming
and describing and deciding the names of
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms, and also understanding their
phylogenies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've been doing since the
start of my career with Professor Korff,
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course I have moved and evolved in
the field as it has evolved itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm terribly excited to be back at
Cornell, and I know some of the faces here
[SPEAKER_04]: were my professors or my colleagues then,
and it's absolutely wonderful to be back
[SPEAKER_04]: at the herbarium, where there's so much to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just entering that herbarium is entering
into one of the most precious places in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world, because of all the wonderful
wealth of fungi that are there,
[SPEAKER_04]: not only from the region, but also in the
discomycytes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my work has, I work mainly with fungal
diversity, of tropical fungi, and I will
[SPEAKER_04]: not say only discomycytes, because some of
my students back in Venezuela were
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in other groups that were not
discomycytes, so I had to broad my
[SPEAKER_04]: interest and work with other groups as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also work with ecology, life history,
and fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to understand the biology of this
fungi, what are they doing, why are they
[SPEAKER_04]: in that environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for this talk, I want to wrap up a bit
and place myself where I come from,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my lineage of Cornell mycologists,
because as I stand, as they say,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the soldier of giants, and it's true,
I totally do, and most of them in my case
[SPEAKER_04]: have been Cornell mycologists,
and I will, one of the goals of this talk
[SPEAKER_04]: is also to excite you and to make you very
interested in CUP herbarium and in Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: herbarium, so that you will deposit your
specimens there, and you'll understand
[SPEAKER_04]: after this talk why is that so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to start with fungal diversity,
this is a slide you must all know very
[SPEAKER_04]: well, there's all this saying about how
many fungi are there, are there 1.5
[SPEAKER_04]: million, are there 5 million fungi,
every time somebody goes and samples,
[SPEAKER_04]: does environmental sampling all of a
sudden from one centimeter of soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: there comes 100,000 sequences,
so nobody really knows, but if there are
[SPEAKER_04]: that amount of fungi, which probably there
are, we know very little about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know less than 5% probably of what's
out there, and we understand even,
[SPEAKER_04]: as time goes by, we understand less and
less about these organisms, because now
[SPEAKER_04]: it's all about sequencing, and people have
forgotten how to describe or how to even
[SPEAKER_04]: look at their organisms in the field,
less understand their biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I try, that's what I do, I try to
understand the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go out to the field, I collect this
fungi, these are all CUP fungi,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you can see there, some of them maybe
you will recognize as, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is a beautiful Anthrakovia,
which we will be talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: and these are Pisaisas, and this is by
Sporella, some of these fungi are
[SPEAKER_04]: percolate, and some are inoperculate,
and I work on both groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first group I'll mention is the
group of operculate fungi that
[SPEAKER_04]: Pisaisomyces, and this is a real picture,
it's not fake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine a frog just sitting there,
and the person being there at the time
[SPEAKER_04]: where that happened, I always dreamed it
would happen to me, but it didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a photo that somebody sent to me
from Borneo, it's a collaborator that's
[SPEAKER_04]: working with a group of us in a beautiful
genus that I mentioned, I will mention in
[SPEAKER_04]: a little while, that's called Kukiaina,
the name over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this comes from Borneo, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: These operculate Discomyces have the
characteristics that their ascus opens by
[SPEAKER_04]: a lid, it just pops up and pops open and
the spores are dispersed in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That lid can be on the top or can be a
littler on the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: The vast majority of these fungi,
the vast diversity, the highest diversity
[SPEAKER_04]: is in temperate regions, but in the
tropics particularly, and in the tropics
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout the world, the genus Kukiaina,
which is of the group that has the lateral
[SPEAKER_04]: lid, is very, very abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for years, and still up to date,
we have been studying the genus Kukiaina
[SPEAKER_04]: with a group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before 2002, we thought there were only
four species, which were all that had been
[SPEAKER_04]: described.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a very hairy one that we
called one name, a little one that was
[SPEAKER_04]: less hairy, like this one, the Kukiaina
speciosa group, which we noticed had a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of difference in colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we went to the microscope,
it looked the same, so we called it
[SPEAKER_04]: Kukiaina speciosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a third one, which was a little
smaller, and then another one,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I'll show you the pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were four species in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We almost didn't care to look very much at
the microscopy because we thought they
[SPEAKER_04]: were those four, and that's it throughout
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2006, we started working with
colleagues from the Farlo Herbarium at
[SPEAKER_04]: Harvard, Don Feaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started working with molecular on these
groups of fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was in Venezuela then, looking at
all these different color variations on
[SPEAKER_04]: this Kukiaina speciosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started noticing things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started understanding a bit more and
going back to the morphology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So since 2006, only three species have
been described.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not because we are sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just because we still do not
understand what's going on with that
[SPEAKER_04]: group.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so, this is just a Kukiaina speciosa
complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ranges from all colors, but that's the
only thing that we see, colors and
[SPEAKER_04]: geographical variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no morphological as we start the
morphology under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that tells us there's any
differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we have done sequences of this,
we can see that the speciosa that's up
[SPEAKER_04]: here has different clades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these clades really relate with
colors, and which I have not marked there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but this is, for example, is a coral.
[SPEAKER_04]: These ones are the more yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yellowish.
[SPEAKER_04]: These ones are the whitish and the brown
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people, at the beginning, when they
started describing all those names they
[SPEAKER_04]: had for each color, and I'm talking about
even the 1700s and the 1800s, they were
[SPEAKER_04]: right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are all these names which we're
gonna probably need to go back to and
[SPEAKER_04]: rescue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have been going back to Kukiaina
looking them under the microscope,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have been noticing a few things
that we had not seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been noticing some difference in
the hair, some differences in the
[SPEAKER_04]: structures, and some differences also in
the growth, and who knows how many other
[SPEAKER_04]: differences there are in their physiology,
which we have not even looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Tricholoma is a very homogeneous clade
throughout the world, and this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: clade we're called Kukiaina in Ceticia is,
which doesn't mean much to you at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an edible fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a big fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about two inches high and one inch in
diameter or smaller, but it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of its colors, when you're in
the Amazon, for example, in low tropical
[SPEAKER_04]: forests, it occurs so abundantly that you
can even pick them up like if there were
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds or flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are edible, and in Mexico,
they're even sold in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't believe this the first time that
in an Indian community in Venezuela,
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody told me and I said, oh no,
you must be wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't tell me anything else,
so I totally was in disbelief until I
[SPEAKER_04]: heard, of course, that yes, they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I've tried them and they're
pretty, they don't taste like anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a beautiful drawing by Madame
Legale, an expert on the discomy seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: where the intricacy of this parapheresis
is shown and also the striation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: spores, which is an important character.
[SPEAKER_04]: This fungus is very particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only the Kukiaina speciosa complex
so that you can see the color variation
[SPEAKER_04]: again from white to brown from all these
incredible colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Tricholoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that the long hairs,
it's very easy to identify and the clade
[SPEAKER_04]: is very homogeneous throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a specimen from China which
has smooth spores and it's very related to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last clade that we have is a
Kukiaina inseticia clade, which it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: together with the other species that we
know, and this one occurs only in Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some cautions when studying this
fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever go to the tropics,
and there are several programs where
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell takes students to the tropics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll be able, if you're there,
you'll be able to find one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in the lowland tropics,
you will find Kukiaina tricholoma and
[SPEAKER_04]: speciosa, the two that I've shown mostly,
but there's a third one called Kukiaina
[SPEAKER_04]: venezuela, which can also, that occurs in
highland.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may be able to have some time in
your life to look at this fungus under the
[SPEAKER_04]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to make sure that you remember
that color is important, that geographical
[SPEAKER_04]: region is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also that in this particular family,
there's a phenomenon which doesn't occur
[SPEAKER_04]: in other groups, which is that Ascospore
mature simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in each apothecium, in each fruit body,
all the spores will be in the same state
[SPEAKER_04]: of development.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the acid will be in the same state of
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Korf always was very excited
with this fact, because it doesn't occur
[SPEAKER_04]: in other groups of fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably something very
interesting to study evolutionary by some
[SPEAKER_04]: of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but this has led to problems in the
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people have described new species
based on immature spores, because this is
[SPEAKER_04]: not something we see in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we look at an apothec, on a fruit
body, spores are in all different stages
[SPEAKER_04]: of development.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about, what do we know about the
biology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we know very little.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a certain point, I was painting,
placing color pins in the under,
[SPEAKER_04]: besides the apothec, I did this for years,
but this was in the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was a huge rainfall and
everything got washed away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I did it with another species that
occurred at my university in Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the same thing happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the, these things grow on little twigs
and little seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can imagine having a pin
next to it and trying to watch its
[SPEAKER_04]: development throughout time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very, very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So after maybe one month, they are,
they are resistant, they are long lived.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing had happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do know there's an imperfect state
called Molliardiomyces that was described.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you know now, there's one fungus,
one name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, of course, this is called this
would be called the asexual state of
[SPEAKER_04]: Kukiaina, in this case, speciosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one fungus, one name is a big
decision that was, that happened in the,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Melbourne, in the code, in the meeting
there in Melbourne, already in 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been quite a few years that this
new rule has been there in the code of
[SPEAKER_04]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant to bring that new code to show it
to you, but I have it in the office,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you'd like to look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second group of fungi that I work
with are the Leoshoomyces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the inoperculate dyscomyces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, in all of this group,
they're supposed to be a very homogeneous
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of, of spore discharge, which is what
by a pore, by a pore in the, in the apex
[SPEAKER_04]: of the ascus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So through that little tiny pore,
which you, which frequently stains blue
[SPEAKER_04]: under reagents that have iodine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this pore supposed to have some starch
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been used in taxonomy to divide
these two groups, and it holds
[SPEAKER_04]: phylogenetically.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the highest diversity of cup fungi
are in this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's much more diverse than the
Leoshoomyces worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing with these groups is that in
general, they're very, very tiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are beautiful and have been
really used throughout history.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, fluorocyboria, which stains
wood green, has been used in, in making
[SPEAKER_04]: furniture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when one sees those beautiful pieces
of old furniture, where there's all this
[SPEAKER_04]: little flowers, for example, made in wood,
whatever is green has been made from wood,
[SPEAKER_04]: where the mycelium of this fungus is
included.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are other Leoshoomyces that you
know, and Vysporella, and one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hylocytes facie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the fungi I've been working in
the last few years, the last two years,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was published, I think last year,
is this fungus, which is kind of bizarre.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it on my post on FaceTime,
and somebody asked me, what's that
[SPEAKER_04]: horrendous fungus?
[SPEAKER_04]: What fungus that you have there on your
post?
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interest of this fungi is that I
looked at it for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just started looking at it,
and then I left it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was continuing with other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came back to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was something wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And its placement does not prove anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did ITS sequence and LSU.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also an elongation factor in this
tree, and studied other genes as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just comes somewhere there in the
Leoshoomyces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no placement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why is there no good placement for
this fungus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there are very few of these fungi
that have been sequenced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, every time that we work with
one of the Leoshoomyces, we find that it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't give us much information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phylogeny doesn't really give us much
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the case of vulgaria lacula,
there is an ascus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has brown ascus pores, and it has weird
paraffices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could tell you much more about this
fungus, but I will just tell you that the
[SPEAKER_04]: way the ascus breaks is very particularly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't break through a pore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just breaks like another totally
different and unrelated group of fungus,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is by the total break of the rupture
of the spore wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end, we end up just with two
walls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the apex of the acai disintegrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how spores are released.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is here, you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And little by little, this took years to
understand, many, many months at least,
[SPEAKER_04]: of understanding how all this process
started and continued, and how the wall
[SPEAKER_04]: broke until only the two walls were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has not been described yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of people had looked at vulgaria
lacula.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this only happened because I looked,
and looked, and looked for a long time
[SPEAKER_04]: under the microscope, even to the point
where I thought, why am I looking so much?
[SPEAKER_04]: Until I understood this happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was published, like an important
thing, because this had not been recorded
[SPEAKER_04]: yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is important to look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another issue I've been very interested in
since my PhD work, and that was in 1990
[SPEAKER_04]: under Professor Korf, have been the
connections between the sexual and asexual
[SPEAKER_04]: states, which before each of them,
as I've already mentioned, have their own
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I studied this little fungus due to the
persistence of Professor Korf,
[SPEAKER_04]: which because this fungus is a quarter of
a millimeter in diameter, very difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: to find in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took a lot of going throughout the
world and a lot of time in the field in
[SPEAKER_04]: order to find a few of the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did a monograph on this fungus,
and also looked at its anamorphic,
[SPEAKER_04]: at its asexual form, which was called then
Pseudospiropis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's called Strosmeria.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very uncommon fungus in the
sense that they're usually not brown
[SPEAKER_04]: dematiasis anamorphs connected to the
Osumites seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very few.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also there are other characters in
this fungus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this, since I have been working at
that time, how did we do the connections?
[SPEAKER_04]: You must wonder.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no molecular involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was no way to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did cultures very carefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cultures of the ascospores of the sexual
body and the single ascospores and
[SPEAKER_04]: weighted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it homotallic or atherotallic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there something there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So after months when we had totally
forgotten that the cultures were there,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of a sudden, Professor Korf was
shouting, it's growing, it's growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was the Pseudospiropis growing
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, connecting this anamorphic and
Tiliomorphs, there is this fungus called
[SPEAKER_04]: Tricholorina javanica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year I went to Mozambique in a
very, very bad time of the year for a
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting trip I had been invited to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, you know, a national park,
Gorongosa National Park.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have, one has to collect with a
garden because of the elephants and other
[SPEAKER_04]: animals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody's permitted but to be on the
jeep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very exciting because you see an
elephant over there and you think there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a tiger going to come to attack you,
but nothing of that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were scraping the floor, scraping
everything because there were so few
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were really depressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why did we come in this time of the
year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Until we started finding things that were
totally unusual.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we started finding this hairy,
thing, we didn't know at all what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent it to some colleagues, experts in
anamorphs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we grew it in culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grew beautifully, lots of hairs coming
from those petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were able to sequence it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sequenced as one of the few times
it happens, identical with a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: percent similarity to Tricholorina
javanica, which was only known by its
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit body and just a few years before
there had been somebody working on the,
[SPEAKER_04]: on the sexual state and had been able to
obtain the fungus in culture, the
[SPEAKER_04]: anamorphic culture, but had never seen it
in nature, neither knew anything about
[SPEAKER_04]: where it occurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really exciting when that things
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, I've been, I am not going to
mention other examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are many of these anamorphidium
connection, which now we are lucky to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to do using molecular.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there has ever been molecular,
its DNA has been studied.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually the case is not that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it lasts to nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we describe it as again,
the old method.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the third thing I've been working with
are fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also last year there was a big fire in
the Smoky Mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a fire that started in 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started studying it in 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: It started in November and it was,
it was contained by mid December.
[SPEAKER_04]: People died.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structures were lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really the town of Kattenberg was,
when we started going there in March of
[SPEAKER_04]: 2017, it was very sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you've all seen the recent
fires on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not unusual for the West coast,
but it is unusual for the East coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's sad to say that probably with
the weather changes, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't want to use the word climate
change, but it may happen that we get
[SPEAKER_04]: abundance of water or more fires also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started going there,
this is what we saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was nothing, but that's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was really, when looking carefully
at the soil, fungi in March were already
[SPEAKER_04]: growing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fungi specifically, cop fungi and
some of the agarics were already growing
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went for once a month during a whole
year and we've understood there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal succession present there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many fungi repeated themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these fungi were like,
where are they coming from?
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden they were particularly to
a fungal community that's already known to
[SPEAKER_04]: occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's some of these fungi already known
from the Western United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, did they come from
West to the East?
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden through the air?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they all around and then just land?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to talk a little about the
hypothesis that exists about how are these
[SPEAKER_04]: communities, how do these communities
occur?
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the questions where this fungi,
sorry, are called pyrophilous fungi,
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi that grow after fire, they're
friends of fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is Geopixis carbonaria on the
top.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is morel and I have some in my lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: If some of you want to see, I'm not giving
out anyone because I'm going to eat them
[SPEAKER_04]: myself, but I've been waiting for a
special occasion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I may make a dish at some of the
departmental parties and we can all eat
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is a fungal community like post
fire and what explains that distribution?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, as I said, there was,
we found like 50 species specific to burn
[SPEAKER_04]: sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a succession that was evident,
especially on year number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: On year number two, there's forests
growing again and there are many other
[SPEAKER_04]: things growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did find new records and some of
them with totally unresolved taxonomy
[SPEAKER_04]: still being worked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the group of Ascomy seeds that
we found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, I am working right now with
Anthropocene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthracobia, which is bringing again,
some of the same things that happen in
[SPEAKER_04]: Coquiaina are being repeated with
Anthracobia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Borchella was the first report for in the
East, this species of Borchella
[SPEAKER_04]: exuberance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the Basidium icota, there were new
ecology things that started appearing in
[SPEAKER_04]: spring that were known only from other
seasons as the same as Mycena and Foliora
[SPEAKER_04]: hylandesa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the most frequently the
Foliora, Geopixis carbonara everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this fungi, which are growing clusters
and they're difficult to get out of soil
[SPEAKER_04]: because a whole clump of soil comes with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one can start understanding why are
they there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first report of that
Borchella, which was already published and
[SPEAKER_04]: I have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interesting thing with Anthracobia
is that there are also different colors of
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthracobia, different morphologies in
Anthracobia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm doing the Anthracobia phylogeny
and I'm working on several genes of
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthracobia.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is only ITS.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see that there are different
clades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here in a very rough manner,
just to start with, one can see that
[SPEAKER_04]: probably there are these species present,
but there are other clades in between
[SPEAKER_04]: which we know nothing about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is probably not Anthracobia in
Ecuador, but another genus and there are
[SPEAKER_04]: other things involved there which have
been very mixed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, we're trying to solve
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have gone back to trying to
understand the morphologies of these
[SPEAKER_04]: groups and also we're finding lots of
cryptic species in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot that we're working on and
we don't understand yet only about these
[SPEAKER_04]: genus in particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you'll be interested in these
three hypotheses that I mentioned already
[SPEAKER_04]: of what explains a distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll just mention them very briefly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is the spore dispersal
hypothesis, which says that these spores
[SPEAKER_04]: come from elsewhere and finding an
environment totally with nothing,
[SPEAKER_04]: with no competition at all, they start
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this hypothesis has not been very,
if true, genetic diversity should be low
[SPEAKER_04]: in the population and spores should
germinate easily and none of these things
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second hypothesis says there is a
spore or sclerotium bank that doesn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: eliminated when fire passes through,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're dormant until fire comes
and they start growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third hypothesis is the one that
we are working on, some of my colleagues
[SPEAKER_04]: and me, which is called the body snatcher
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says that fungi are present there
inside plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these plants, we have sequenced,
my colleagues and myself, we have been
[SPEAKER_04]: working in sequence sequencing mosses and
sequencing lichens from the Smoky
[SPEAKER_04]: Mountains and from other parts of the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the preliminary results prove that
they are present in mosses and that these
[SPEAKER_04]: fungi are present in mosses, not only in
the Smokies, but elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's environmental sequencing
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been, and I do not have the
results with me because they have not been
[SPEAKER_04]: published and they're still being worked
by colleagues in the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Tennessee and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really their work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are there and they're present.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will probably be the most common
hypothesis, the most real hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_04]: they survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do they survive?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, nobody's sure yet, but it can be
related to the amount of water that mosses
[SPEAKER_04]: have or that rhizomes maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire sometimes passes very quickly and the
rhizomes are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows, there may be a combination
of methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: There might be also some structures that
persist on the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Though that could be, it's more uncommon
because here in the eastern coast,
[SPEAKER_04]: that particular region had not had a fire
in hundreds of years, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last part of my, I'm switching now
completely to talk about herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And why do I talk about herbarium?
[SPEAKER_04]: All this beautiful fungi that you've seen
there end somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're important to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important that they are, that they
end somewhere and that they end as a
[SPEAKER_04]: collection in a herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is photographs that are taken from
CUP herbarium, which is a Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: University plant pathology herbarium that
used to be housed in this building in the
[SPEAKER_04]: third floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's not too far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you have been there and it has a
wonderful space of its own now in Game
[SPEAKER_04]: Farm Road.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are all sorts of different kinds
of specimens, starting by the pasper 2,
[SPEAKER_04]: which are just for classes, for showing
diseases, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: To students, they're mounted in a way with
cotton, et cetera, that are very easy to
[SPEAKER_04]: pass around and to show them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're welcome to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have only fungi, it has
bacteria, it has viruses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has all sorts of plant diseases that
are very, very nicely preserved in this
[SPEAKER_04]: pasper 2.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are thousands of pasper 2s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the collections starting with
wet soil are in, they are in this,
[SPEAKER_04]: these huge boxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are some of the Atkinson's
slides.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are about 500,000 specimens at
CUP herbarium, fungi from all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a new project where CUP herbarium has
been involved since, well, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years ago, it has been the digitization
of herbaria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the microportal, it's a project that I
was involved with, and CUP herbarium has
[SPEAKER_04]: been involved with for many years,
doing macro fungi and micro fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now all of these specimens are
digitized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 85 institutions from all of the United
States have participated and from other
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of the world also have participated.
[SPEAKER_04]: CUP had, and Kathy had, Kathy Hodge had a
very good idea in digitizing not the
[SPEAKER_04]: specimens themselves, but all the card
catalog that was there thanks to Wetzel
[SPEAKER_04]: and Korff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the whole herbarium was able to be
digitized in the sense that people all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the world, because this is an open
access, can see what's there and can ask
[SPEAKER_04]: for specimens that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we keep getting requests for fungi that
we have, and that people only learn of
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the microportal.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the microportal, there are almost four
million records from all of those
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just did a little sample that took
me 15 minutes, because there are several
[SPEAKER_04]: tools in the microportal where I just
said, I want to know what's the Latin
[SPEAKER_04]: American fungal diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just popped up all these numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, this only is including
specimens that are in herbaria and the
[SPEAKER_04]: specimens that have been digitized,
usually geo-referenced, of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: because we know they're from Latin
America, and imaged sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these countries, the number of
records and the number of species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides that, the microportal can permit
making heat maps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also done in minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's amazing when one tries this and
all the information that one can retrieve
[SPEAKER_04]: from this portal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did just because, of course,
I'm from Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was interested in knowing the heat map
from Venezuela, my own country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, this is a little further down
than Venezuela, but it includes,
[SPEAKER_04]: because Venezuela usually should end here,
so there must be some little problem there
[SPEAKER_04]: with the microportal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shouldn't tell you that, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, the problem has been solved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each of these, that's another kind of
map that one can do in seconds also,
[SPEAKER_04]: where each dot represents a collecting
spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just clicking on the dot, you'll find the
species, the collector, and the locality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really a wonderful tool to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this tool, one can learn also how
fungi are moving throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is climate change affecting some diseases
and how some diseases are moving from one
[SPEAKER_04]: place to the other?
[SPEAKER_04]: When does disease start and where?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of information that can
be retrieved from the literature and from
[SPEAKER_04]: the microportal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about your specimen, specimens are a
vital source of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, we can, of course, obtain DNA
from specimens that are hundreds of years
[SPEAKER_04]: old.
[SPEAKER_04]: And new techniques, that did not happen
when I was a graduate student,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was sitting down in this same room,
like you guys, some of you guys are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have those tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I won't say how many years,
this has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine in 50 years, 30 years,
100 years, what information will we be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to retrieve from those samples?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we care for these samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's important for all of you
to deposit your samples there,
[SPEAKER_04]: the organisms you're working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we get some organisms deposited
there, but very seldom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please do, please count on the
herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many questions that can be
answered and you're welcome to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have great facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a dissecting scope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's there for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we welcome anything that you'd be
interested for your research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this was supposed to be before this
slide, but I will talk about a little,
[SPEAKER_04]: just very quickly about the lineage,
where I come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said, I stand in the shoulder of
giants and this is the Cornell Lineage.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all these people, which I will
not name with their students.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dudley Atkinson, Wetzel Fitzpatrick,
Korf, and that's my name over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all come and we call each other
brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I call, for example, Don Fister,
my mycological brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think I'm going to have time
to talk in detail about some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: people, but Dudley was the first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to say, that there was
like a tradition like Dudley was the
[SPEAKER_04]: professor of Atkinson and Durand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has this beautiful fungus named
after him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Cornell, first president, purchased
Cornell first herbarium in 1870,
[SPEAKER_04]: five years after Cornell started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did they, was that important?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because having collections was a pride of
an institution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having collections and having museums was,
it still is, important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and people knew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Atkinson was, as we know, this
wonderful and incredible person who was a
[SPEAKER_04]: student of Durand, Fitzpatrick,
and Wetzel of his students.
[SPEAKER_04]: And was a wonderful photographer and
recorded and did this great book on
[SPEAKER_04]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wetzel, how can we not know Wetzel?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're standing in the room called after
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the father of Cornell plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_04]: He started, he established the first
department in plant pathology in the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant pathology herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was the professor of Fitzpatrick and
Durand and worked with sclerotinia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he traveled extensively throughout
the world and had collaborators that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can see over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to mention Durand,
because we have in our herbarium,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Durand herbarium, all these comite
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He studied here, but then went elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then he donated his herbarium to CUP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fitzpatrick was Professor Korff's
professor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was responsible for the herbarium
and also taught a lot of mycology courses,
[SPEAKER_04]: which then, of course, Professor Korff,
which died three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many of you may have known him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He continued the work of Fitzpatrick,
wonderful work in the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: The herbarium grew throughout the years
with Wetzel and him until the more or less
[SPEAKER_04]: 400,000, 500,000 that it has today.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did an incredible amount of
publications, as you can see there,
[SPEAKER_04]: was a member of the nomenclature committee
for fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he retired, kind of I took his
place in that committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was also a talented actor.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was very good in acting, as can be seen
here in his photo when he was a student at
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not how he dressed to come to
class, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was here impersonating Elias Fries,
one of the very important mycologists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did that and was asked several
times to impersonate him in several
[SPEAKER_04]: international congresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he really was very good at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a photograph.
[SPEAKER_04]: Richard Pickoff was a professor president
of the Mycological Society of America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a photo that Kathy took of him
on his 80th birthday, where there's
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Korff and there's some of you
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see one person over here,
which is Professor Laura Pierce standing
[SPEAKER_04]: at the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see, the tradition continues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've come now to the acknowledgment
part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will not go through the whole
acknowledgment, but I want especially to
[SPEAKER_04]: thank Kathy Hodge, Professor Hodge,
for inviting me to give this talk,
[SPEAKER_04]: for her many insights into this talk,
and also for being the major person that
[SPEAKER_04]: brought me back to Cornell to be a curator
of the plant pathology herbarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm delighted to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a lot of projects that we're
already starting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hope many of you will get excited
and also start working with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank all of these people
that you see there, which have
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborated in different projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Donald Feaster from Harvard, and Demeter
from the University of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides all the other colleagues,
Karen Hughes, also from the University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have all been relevant people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meredith Blackwell, in this presentation,
in different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you to all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I end with this picture of Venezuela,
one of the Tepuis, which we cannot go at
[SPEAKER_04]: the moment, but we hope to be able to go
back in the not-so-far future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions for Teresa?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the ecological significance of
colors with a cup fungi?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there have been many hypotheses,
and some of them are dispersion.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are logs, and there are different
lots of insects that feed from the
[SPEAKER_04]: hymenium of this fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may be a color may be there to
attract them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's been said a lot that they're
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are really toxins that
accumulate in that the fungus doesn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: a better way to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a theory that I have read.
[SPEAKER_04]: I myself have not studied it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are all these sort of
relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also mammals that feed from fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the color may have some attraction
towards them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But mostly we see worms and arthropods and
little insects usually feeding on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, there are not too many
studies made on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the Coquina speciosa specifically,
why are they growing just one next to each
[SPEAKER_04]: other sometimes and having totally
different colors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we know that they may be different
species.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is the color significance there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can find white and brown and
oranges and all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it could be related to light at
some point, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really and truly, to answer your
question, we have not much idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it may differ, of course, with a group
that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question about getting your insights on
the one fungus nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a couple of the agriculturally
significant species, there have been some
[SPEAKER_01]: heated debates on what the name will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there some guiding principles on
choosing what name is chosen?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a whole code that I have in
the room next door.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have all the codes of nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_04]: These debates are very, very heated and
very, very long, as you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only to take the one fungus one name took
30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see there were all sorts of
debates in Congresses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the panels and open panels and even
votes until finally it came to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, at a certain point, it was decided
that the sexual stage would be the
[SPEAKER_04]: prevailing state, but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then following Congress, so lots of
people said, why is the sexual stage going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be more important than the asexual
state?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go by priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whichever name was erected first,
that should be the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about all the fungi that
pathologists know by one name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that people in medical mycology know by
a particular name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that have economical importance?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there have been committees created.
[SPEAKER_04]: To avoid these really horrible fights,
there have been committees created for
[SPEAKER_04]: each of the different groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these subcommittees intensely debate
and decide, together with lots of experts,
[SPEAKER_04]: which name should prevail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are called now conserved names.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these lists are of conserved names just
to make them different to sanction names,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is another group of names that were
erected by Frese and Pursun.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have their own status.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, those names have the ability to
be discussed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody, and those are proposals,
so somebody is not happy with a name that
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the time the organism has,
the person presents a proposal and bases
[SPEAKER_04]: it, and then we discuss it at the
committee where I am in, and that takes
[SPEAKER_04]: forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we vote one time, and then we vote a
second time, and we vote again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We vote a third time, and then a year
after, we come through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, at the congresses now,
not the botanic congresses, but now a rule
[SPEAKER_04]: has changed also.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my colleagues are able to change the
rules in their own international
[SPEAKER_04]: mycological congresses, which are every
three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, then they have to be
approved in the botanic congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are still little by little getting
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to ask me about DNA as type
specimens, no, it's not yet possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot erect steel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was debated a lot in the last
congress, and some of you were there,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it didn't pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a lot of, I won't get into
that, but I will be very happy to talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: any of you about why it was not approved.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be eventually approved,
but not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Theresa, you showed many trees indicating
relationship from one taxon to the next.
It seems like a fantastic amount of fungal
sequencing has been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you comment on just how, to what
extent sequencing was done of these
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of different fungi?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now everybody's sequencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only the mycological community or
the experts, also amateurs are sequencing
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we're having more and more
sequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And amateurs have had a very important
tool, have been a very important group in
[SPEAKER_04]: sequencing, because nowadays you can send
a sample somewhere, and for $30 or
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes less, you obtain a sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, for particular genes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But amateurs have become very good at this
and their associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why you see that amount of
sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been already sequencing since 30
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of these trees that you saw are
one gene, some are five genes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now there's a tendency and a huge
project to try to sequence a whole genome,
[SPEAKER_04]: which amazingly doesn't cost that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: In money value, it costs about $300 to
sequence a whole genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so of course, it's not little money
for any of us, but if for a project,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you see is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of sequencing that has
been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so many fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still so much more to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have a lot more work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll let you guys go while we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join me in thanking Tori.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
