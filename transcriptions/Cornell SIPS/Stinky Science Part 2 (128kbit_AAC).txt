[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chamber flowers like this, I should
say, have evolved all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is weird enough, and it would be
worth it if this was the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that strikes me as an
evolutionary biologist as really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting is that, you know,
Southeast Asia has these, and the genus
[SPEAKER_00]: Amorphophallus, as Paul knows,
is found across the African tropics as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the Asian tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a large genus that's gotten
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also Aristolochius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a very ancient group of
vines, 200, 300 species of them around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very ancient in pan-tropical
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make trap flowers also.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just hang them up in trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like pieces of dead meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not appealing, but they're
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and they also trap their
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other plants in the, in the skunk
cabbage family that you're familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: all form trap flowers, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some really funky milkweeds from
South Africa, including Hoodia,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that several of you know as a
kind of appetite suppressant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growth industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are succulents that look like cacti,
but they're actually milkweeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so the compounds that we studied
last time in this plant that we were able
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify using, you know, analytical
chemistry are actually relatively simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pass this around and you can look at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a time course with clocks to show
you what time of day we were collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've basically tracked five
molecules in here, ones that are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative of carrion mimicry or dung
mimicry in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point I wanted to make was that
this happens around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every continent has a carrion flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not always this big,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're tapping into with
volatile sulfides, with phenol and creosol
[SPEAKER_00]: and indole, things that you smell in,
in feces of dogs or cats or herbivores
[SPEAKER_00]: like cows and horses, those are universal
signals, or cues rather, that are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable indicators of the presence of
rotting meat or of feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all across the planet, there are
animals that use those resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: as distasteful as they are to us,
as places to lay their eggs and grow their
[SPEAKER_00]: young, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those guys are trapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a sensory trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them to be good mothers, blowflies
have to find rotting meat or feces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to find it at just the right
time, before the yeasts and molds take it
[SPEAKER_00]: over, and not too early so that it's not
ready to be digested yet by their grubs
[SPEAKER_00]: and maggots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why forensic entomologists are
so important, that they can track how long
[SPEAKER_00]: a body has been dead by the stage of
development of the blowfly larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the females always make the right
choice as to when exactly to lay the eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that exact moment, there's a
signature of heat, of carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and these five molecules that I'm gonna
show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are her template.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how females choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have picked that lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've broken the code, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Paul will show you is that,
you know, these plants, whether they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the poinsettia family, whether they're in
the rostrolokia family, whether they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: the arum family, whether they're in the
milkweed family, they've all converged on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's other aspects of these that
are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they blotchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Red, patches of red and green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are some of them really hairy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can speculate as to,
you know, a really choosy blowfly female
[SPEAKER_00]: would want, you know, a hairy dead body to
oviposit into, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these flowers are chambers
with holes, just as an orifice,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an ear, would be a great place to lay
eggs in a dead body if you were a blowfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A blowfly female or a burying beetle or
something, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond the gothic horror of this,
what's really interesting is that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of life, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The decomposers of the planet that keep
the ecosystem cycling use cues,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical cues like this, to make their
choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these plants are doing is they're
code breakers, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've found a code that can't be faked,
except they're faking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pollinators have to come,
because if they ignore chemistry that
[SPEAKER_00]: good, they're going to miss out
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cognitive choice they're
making, but they have been selected to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to big dead meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dead elephant, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way we see it at the moment.

Thank you.
Thank you.
