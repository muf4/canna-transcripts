[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: First time, I think, I've presented here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks for giving me the chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you a little bit about
some of the stuff we work on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work on a lot of different projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've chosen something that relates
pretty specifically, I think, to
[SPEAKER_04]: plant-microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to give you the overview,
we're very interested in what microbes are
[SPEAKER_04]: doing in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because microbial communities in soil
are tremendously diverse, and most of
[SPEAKER_04]: those organisms are still uncharacterized,
our focus is first and foremost on that
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity and understanding what drives
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's questions of biogeography,
where we're thinking about how microbes
[SPEAKER_04]: get to where they are and why they're
successful in those environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those can be large-scale biogeography
and what drives that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also in terms of agriculture,
that's management.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things we do very much influence the
success of dispersal, the fitness of the
[SPEAKER_04]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know why that is, what makes
them successful or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also interested in evolution because
microbes can evolve kind of quickly,
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they change will affect both
whether they're successful in that
[SPEAKER_04]: environment as well as what they do in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So specifically, we're interested in how
their genomes change and how that change
[SPEAKER_04]: relates to the diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our big question here relates a lot
to horizontal gene transfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who are they exchanging information
with?
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that dependent on dispersal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or community composition?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that do to their function?
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of their functions, we want to
know how their diversity affects what they
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very interested in the carbon and
nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of these things relate to soil
health.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're interested in that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of carbon, we're interested in
how microbes transform carbon in the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they contribute to soil organic
matter formation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of our soil organic matter is made
up of dead microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the growth and death of microbes is
super important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, microbes contribute a lot to
that nitrogen cycle as well in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: making nitrogen available, transforming
that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, that brings us back to
plants because plants are the big driver
[SPEAKER_04]: of these systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether it's biogeography or management
or their evolution or their function,
[SPEAKER_04]: plants are constantly pushing on the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the microbes are, of course,
pushing back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the more we get interested in for
example, the carbon cycle, the more we
[SPEAKER_04]: realize that what microbes do in terms of
the carbon cycle is driven by the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what I'll tell you a little
bit about today, specifically some work
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been doing to get more involved with
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the phenomena I'm going to be
talking about today, something we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: starting to really look at in my lab is
called priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the idea of priming goes back a
long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the idea that microbes are
interacting with soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the carbon that stores in the soil,
which is basically the basis of soil
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants do not have the enzymes that they
need to get access to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like you can't eat, you can't digest
plant material without your microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enzymatically, a eukaryote just doesn't
have the diversity of enzymes that
[SPEAKER_04]: microbes have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I have microbes in my gut that help
me eat plant material.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants are interacting with microbes
in the soil to get access to the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: in the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what priming is, is if I add a little
bit of carbon to the soil microbes,
[SPEAKER_04]: I change their activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be a negative priming
result, in which case I add some carbon to
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil that activates these microbes and
they cause more SOM to be mineralized than
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have expected based on the amount
of carbon I add.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically I'm priming the pump,
just like you're priming a water pump.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side, you can actually get
positive priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes when you add carbon to soil,
you cause some of that carbon to be stored
[SPEAKER_04]: permanently or semi-permanently as SOM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So presumably that's because the microbes
grow and when they die, their little dead
[SPEAKER_04]: bodies are contributing to an accumulation
of carbon and stable pools.
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on how we add the carbon and
the environmental conditions, we can get
[SPEAKER_04]: one or the other response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the literature is a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to know exactly when you're
gonna get one or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: People do the same thing in different
experiments and come up with different
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's not a good strong mechanism
as to what's driving this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this is just adding carbon,
but in the real world, this would be
[SPEAKER_04]: driven by plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through either riser deposition or
exudation, plants have the ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: release some of their photosynthetic
carbon through the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And presumably, hypothetically,
they could be driving negative or positive
[SPEAKER_04]: priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason for this primarily might be
that by getting an advantage by activating
[SPEAKER_04]: negative priming, the microbes go after
the SOM, that's mineralizing carbon CO2,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then that also releases things like N
and P that are locked up in that SOM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant would have an ability to push
on the gas pedal, try and get more
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients by activating the microbes,
hypothetically.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of phenomena we're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got interested in this because we're
in a great school of plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a collaboration with Taryn Barley
in horticulture who was working with a
[SPEAKER_04]: priming experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was doing out at Arno Forest with
maple trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the same time, just by coincidence,
I was doing some work collaborating with,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least I had taken over for a project
Gene Madsen had started in microbiology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gene, as many of you know,
passed a few years ago because I did a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of similar research to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took over some of his projects when he
died and took them to completion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just so happens that these two
things intersected in a very interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the experiment Taryn was doing was
taking soil from the maple trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a typical priming experiment,
you add different carbon sources to that
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is without the roots present.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you add glucose, you don't really
see significant priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was adding aromatics because she knew
that these roots were producing aromatic
[SPEAKER_04]: phenolic acids and aromatic acids in their
exudates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she wanted to know sort of what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were they doing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And was this relating to priming?
[SPEAKER_04]: So she added benzoic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as combinations of different
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she did the experiment with other
kinds of aromatics as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just showing the result for benzoic
acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: But benzoic acid induced significant
priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had this sort of synergistic
effect when you had glucose and benzoic
[SPEAKER_04]: acid together, which was sort of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the question is sort of what's
going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: So she was able to show that the priming
is in no small part, not surprisingly
[SPEAKER_04]: driven by changes in enzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So beta-galactosidase activity,
the phosphatase activity,
[SPEAKER_04]: N-acetylglucosidase activity, all of these
were accelerated by the presence of this
[SPEAKER_04]: benzoic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we would expect with this
negative priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also see that the priming was driven by
a change in community composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, this is an ordination where each
of these spots is a different community
[SPEAKER_04]: composition.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the spots are close together,
that means the communities are similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's where we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: We add different substrates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then over time, we see those
substrates cause a shift in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we see that the benzoic acid and
benzoic acid plus glucose really caused
[SPEAKER_04]: this different effect from everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that different effect was associated
with higher amounts of priming.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it turned out, she worked with us to
have some help analyzing the microbial
[SPEAKER_04]: communities in these data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of this difference in the
community that was driven by that benzoic
[SPEAKER_04]: acid was affiliated with this one group of
organisms, Brooklyn Dairy ACA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they went through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was super exciting to us because
at the same time we were working with this
[SPEAKER_04]: data from Gene Madsen and we saw some of
the same organisms coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when, am I at seven minutes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was doing stable isotope probing
experiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: He happened to be using 13C
parahydroxybenzoate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could track that into the microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we saw from him was that these
parabercaldaria, which are members of
[SPEAKER_04]: bercaldaria ACA, dominated this activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were exactly the same microbes that
Taryn saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: We isolated some of these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that's very interesting
about them is they're loaded with ring
[SPEAKER_04]: cleavage enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really good at taking apart
soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're loaded with phosphatase activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really good at solubilizing
inorganic phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also tend to associate with the roots
of a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've heard of beta rhizobia,
these nodulating bacteria that are not in
[SPEAKER_04]: the alpha proteobacteria, they're
parabercaldaria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these guys have these tight
associations with plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think that plants are facilitating
their growth and a jump ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: The model we have is these microbes really
like sugars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you give them sugars, they grow like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really like the phenolic acids and
they're able to eat a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you give them the phenolic acids,
they grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you give them the sugars,
they don't induce their ring cleavage
[SPEAKER_04]: activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you give them sugars, they'll grow a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then if you hit them with the phenolic
acids, they'll turn on the ring cleavage
[SPEAKER_04]: and go after this organic matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we think we have a mechanism whereas
the plant could control what the microbe
[SPEAKER_04]: is doing because not everything can eat
these phenolic acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have the phenolic acids,
these guys will be able to grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe not anything that can grow using
sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plant can control who's there and
who's actually going after this organic
[SPEAKER_04]: matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the plant's able to regulate
this priming activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions in the room?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question was, are they bacteria or
fungi?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the parabolic area are bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: An interesting aspect of this is that
related organisms to these parabolic area
[SPEAKER_04]: are often highly enriched in the
hyposphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the potential for three-way
associations like plant, AMF, bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with the AMF.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when people look, they're often
co-occurring with some of these fungal
[SPEAKER_04]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question related more to the analysis,
microbial diversity and how it shifted
[SPEAKER_00]: once it bacteria populations only.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this particular experiment,
we were only tracking the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maple trees that were the subject of
this often host AMF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that AMF probably are part of
that equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, Josh, for spearheading
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Gillian, for the invitation
to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Josh said, this is my second month on
the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really happy to share with you
some of my thoughts about my program and
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the research directions that we'll
be taking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am a vegetable breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the program that I'm starting here at
Cornell is focused on tomato and eggplant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with the emphasis on the
Northeastern United States and New York
[SPEAKER_03]: especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: To give a really high-level overview of
the objectives of our program,
[SPEAKER_03]: really broadly, they are to discover the
genetic basis of traits that are of
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomic or consumer importance in our
region to model strategies for the
[SPEAKER_03]: implementation of new predictive breeding
technologies like genomic selection that
[SPEAKER_03]: have been really widely adopted in
agronomic crop species but are kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: lagging behind in vegetables for several
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, to release cultivars with
high yield excellent quality and
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance to the prevalent diseases in
our region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a faculty member with an extension
appointment, I have been enjoying spending
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of my first several weeks on the job,
getting to know my colleagues in Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooperative Extension and just learning a
little bit more about the nature of tomato
[SPEAKER_03]: and eggplant growing in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've found it both amazing,
but also as a breeder, it kind of daunting
[SPEAKER_03]: just how much variety there is in terms of
how these crops are grown, how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: marketed, and what market classes and crop
types are grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last time the USDA released
statistics for New York State,
[SPEAKER_03]: there were close to 3,000 acres of tomato
production in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes everything from the open
field to high tunnels, which are very
[SPEAKER_03]: important in our state, both for season
extension and for crop protection and also
[SPEAKER_03]: in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there are over 200 acres of
tomatoes under glass in these really high
[SPEAKER_03]: tech facilities that are operated by some
of the world's largest and most
[SPEAKER_03]: sophisticated greenhouse tomato production
companies in our state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomatoes are sold to wholesale
distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sold at produce auctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sold at CSAs and farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're grown in gardens and in urban
farms and urban gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is grown from cherry tomatoes
to heirloom tomatoes to the modern red
[SPEAKER_03]: slicers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in terms of eggplant, I found it
amazing how much variation there is in
[SPEAKER_03]: crop type there, including types that many
people here are largely unfamiliar with,
[SPEAKER_03]: including the African eggplant,
which is not even the same species as the
[SPEAKER_03]: Italian eggplant that we're familiar with,
but it's a really important part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: diet in many regions of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are opportunities for
new markets for New York growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So across the board, across all these
different production systems and market
[SPEAKER_03]: classes, there's a really strong demand
from growers for disease resistance in
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as an illustrated example,
I took this screenshot from Bayer's
[SPEAKER_03]: webpage.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of their tomato varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at the disease resistance
codes, which you might be familiar with if
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at seed catalogs, there's
somewhere between eight and 10 different
[SPEAKER_03]: disease resistances that are stacked in
this one variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is something that is both
amazing to me, but also really daunting as
[SPEAKER_03]: a breeder, just how many different disease
resistances you need in a variety in order
[SPEAKER_03]: to be commercially competitive nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason that breeders have been able
to do this amazing work is really due to a
[SPEAKER_03]: very rich legacy of collection and
characterization and curation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of wild tomato species, almost all of the
disease resistances that are available in
[SPEAKER_03]: modern tomato varieties come from a wild
relative of tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: In many crops, you know, we often hear
people talk about concern about erosion of
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic diversity as a result of modern
breeding compared to some of the land
[SPEAKER_03]: races and traditional varieties that were
grown years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible that tomato is actually
the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the varieties that are
available nowadays, there's more genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: variation in that domesticated tomato gene
pool because of all the variation that
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders have brought in from wild
relatives, predominantly driven by
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I think about how I want to
contribute to this legacy of breeding for
[SPEAKER_03]: disease resistance and solanaceous crops,
one thing that I keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think this is an audience that won't
argue with me too much on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: is how important it is to have some
understanding of the dynamics of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well, I think there are many examples
of this in tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them that's particularly relevant
to our state due to the high tonal
[SPEAKER_03]: production that's important here is tomato
leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a disease that is really a limiting
factor for a high tonal tomato production,
[SPEAKER_03]: although it's not really a concern in the
open field.
[SPEAKER_03]: A project that I was involved in with a
former lab mate of mine, Martha Suderman,
[SPEAKER_03]: who led this work, we characterized the
genetic diversity of strains of tomato
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf mold from our region.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the important takeaways that we
found from some race-typing experiments
[SPEAKER_03]: was that all the strains that we collected
were of two races, race zero and two.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me as a breeder, it's important to
know this because there's one gene that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really used predominantly in tomato
breeding for resistance to tomato leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's CF9, which thankfully confers
resistance against both of these races
[SPEAKER_03]: that we see in our region.
[SPEAKER_03]: But elsewhere in the world, there are
reports of that resistance breaking down.
[SPEAKER_03]: My takeaway moving forward as a plant
breeder is that even if our populations in
[SPEAKER_03]: our region at the moment don't necessarily
warrant it, I think the proactive approach
[SPEAKER_03]: is to start stacking some of these other
resistance genes into our varieties with
[SPEAKER_03]: the expectation that given the usage of
high tunnels and exclusive use of this one
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance gene, we may expect to see that
resistance breaking down in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomato leaf mold is a good example because
it's a pathogen that's been very well
[SPEAKER_03]: characterized at the molecular level in
terms of its host-pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many more examples of
pathosystems where we really know next to
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing about the nature of the variation
in the pathogen that influences the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability of certain strains of populations
to cause disease on varieties and others
[SPEAKER_03]: not to.
[SPEAKER_03]: In earlier work that I did in my PhD,
I was interested in answering this
[SPEAKER_03]: question a little bit in phytophthora
capsicii.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which causes phytophthora blight on
pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we did was take a
collection of isolates, challenge it on
[SPEAKER_03]: different pepper varieties and conduct a
genome-wide association study to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: find those genes that are involved in
virulence on different varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we ended up finding was that the loci
that we had the power to be able to map
[SPEAKER_03]: tended to have an effect on virulence on
all of the peppers that we tested,
[SPEAKER_03]: which seems to suggest that in this
pathosystem, perhaps the strongest effect
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions are race nonspecific.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are smaller effect interactions that
have more of a race specific nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of future directions for my
research program, as I've been talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: extension specialists and colleagues in
pathology and growers, as soon as I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned eggplant, everyone tells me very
silly wilt resistance, which seems like a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good indication that that's
something that should work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm planning on studying the inheritance
of resistance to verticillium wilt and
[SPEAKER_03]: eggplant wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in how that performs
against the two species of verticillium we
[SPEAKER_03]: have, both of which are controlled by a
single gene in tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: My predecessor in tomato breeding at
Cornell, Martha Mutchler did fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: work on foliar fungal disease resistance,
but it's predominantly available in a
[SPEAKER_03]: small number of genetic backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in understanding how we can
use markers related to those genes to
[SPEAKER_03]: predict that resistance in diversity of
other market classes of tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, as I alluded to that the paradigm
for tomato breeding has been back-crossing
[SPEAKER_03]: and integration of qualitative major
effect resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pathogens that breeders have been
slower and less able to make a big impact
[SPEAKER_03]: on are those diseases that are controlled
more by quantitative resistance loci.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in working on some
strategies using some genomics assisted
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding approaches to breed for
resistance to those diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all for your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the moment, my lab is myself and
Arlinda Young, who has been instrumental
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the lab set up as my lab manager,
and I'll be recruiting students and a
[SPEAKER_03]: postdoc and a technician as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions for Greg?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes us six weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Within the tomato leaf mold pathogen,
you said there are race one and two or two
[SPEAKER_02]: different races.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there much genetic diversity within a
race or between races?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the question was in the tomato leaf
mold pathogen, the nature of the genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: variation within and between races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was quite a bit of genetic
variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found evidence for both sexual and
asexual reproduction, and it didn't seem
[SPEAKER_03]: like that genetic variation was
necessarily partitioned by race,
[SPEAKER_03]: which kind of makes sense given that these
race nomenclatures are governed by maybe a
[SPEAKER_03]: single team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about the branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of people you've excavated,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there distinct challenges in the field
environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was the specific disease
issues related to urban agriculture as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to more traditional open field
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that I'm hoping to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: There definitely are very strong
environmental influences on the diseases
[SPEAKER_03]: that are relevant in tomato production.
[SPEAKER_03]: In greenhouses and high tunnels,
things like leaf mold and powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: can be problems, whereas they tend not to
be issues in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I expect there to be similar challenges
in urban environments as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the center of origin of the plant
known?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I keep forgetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was the center of origin of
