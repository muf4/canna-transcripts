[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the final webinar in
a series of 13 on berry crop nutrition and
[SPEAKER_02]: soil management.
[SPEAKER_02]: These webinars were developed for training
ag educators and commercial berry growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The webinars were recorded as part of a
two-year Northeast SARE professional
[SPEAKER_02]: development project led by Dr. Marvin
Pritz, small fruit horticulturalist and
[SPEAKER_02]: berry crop nutrition specialist at Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: The speakers for this week's webinar are
Mr. Jeff Miller, Association Issue Leader
[SPEAKER_02]: from Cornell Cooperative Extension in Ida
County, Laura McDermott, Extension
[SPEAKER_02]: Associate with the Capital District
Vegetable and Small Fruit Program from
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell University, and your host,
myself, Kathy Heidenreich.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Extension Support Specialist with
Cornell University in the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: The agenda for this week's webinar,
apart from the introduction of speakers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we've already done, is the
presentation and the topics of the
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The presentation will include an
introduction to berry soil and nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: management, discussion of the basic soil
test, pH modification and testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cornell soil health test, and tissue
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to listen to the other
recorded webinars in the series,
[SPEAKER_02]: you may do so by going to the link below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down below in the files box, you will see
there are several files that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: download, the berry soil and nutrient
management, Revision 2 is a PDF of this
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a grower pre and post test you can
take to test your knowledge before and
[SPEAKER_02]: after the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a chart that gives you the desired
ranges for foliar analysis for
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries, blueberries, and
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the submission forms for the
standard Cornell soil health test form,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the standard tissue test form
P, or the Cornell soil health test down
[SPEAKER_02]: below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also listed over in the web links box is,
again, the link for the recorded berry
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and nutrient management webinars and
the Cornell fruit resources berry pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without further ado, we will move to
the presentation screen, and Jeff,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're ready for you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a couple minutes in the
beginning part of this presentation to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to you a little bit about soil
testing, soil sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start off
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to you a little bit about soil and
tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hard to manage a crop unless
you have some pieces of information to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you manage that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where soil sampling,
soil testing, and tissue testing come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely two main timeframes
that we talk about when we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling, and that's pre-plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're planting an expensive crop,
like raspberries or blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to prepare the soil
beforehand so that you have the least
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of obstacles and the most optimum
conditions for those expensive crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a great opportunity to take soil tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get analyses back and have time to
actually make some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for these crops, one of the major
things that you have to think about is
[SPEAKER_00]: things like soil drainage as a
possibility, getting irrigation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: site as a second possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what we're talking about today
is the fertility management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that you can change
is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plan on doing a blueberry planting,
you know that you want to get the pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the fours, at least mid fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do not do a soil pH test in
advance of the planting, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not going to have enough time to
modify that pH and have it down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: range that's optimal for that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same would be true in acid soils
and bringing them up to 6 or 6.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on whether you're going to go
with raspberries or strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real opportune time to take
those samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another time to think about soil sampling
is after the planting is already in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the case where you're talking
about maintaining a viable stand at
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taking samples of soil, running them
through a lab and getting an analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then making sure that there's no major
shortages of any important nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are, making sure that you're
applying those nutrients in adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities to optimize both crop yield and
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: A last thing that growers should consider
is protecting the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at it and you say to the
average grower, how much do you apply and
[SPEAKER_00]: do you do soil testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's often enough times where you hear
the answer, I don't really do an awful lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil sampling, but I make sure that I
never short the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that there's a possibility
that there's over-fertilization going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be very costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the nutrient,
that could have some environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: ramifications as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just talking to you about the basic
types of testing, the standard soil test,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a chemical analysis, the Cornell
Soil Health Test, and tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at a standard soil test,
it's something that's conducted at many
[SPEAKER_00]: labs across the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the attempt is to measure the
availability of essential nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each lab has their own setup,
their own procedures, their own materials
[SPEAKER_00]: used to leach out nutrients and
measurements taken on the quantity of
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients that are then reported
back to the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York State, Cornell has done an
awful lot of field research and done some
[SPEAKER_00]: tests to look at what is in the soil and
application rates and the response to
[SPEAKER_00]: application rates given different soil
levels of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the basic chemical analysis that
people would get reports back,
[SPEAKER_00]: interpret them, and adjust their fertility
and pH accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cornell Soil Health Test is a unique
test looking at some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: attributes of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biological aspects and the
physical aspects of the soil and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: impact plant growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Laura's going to be talking to you
about that a little bit later in this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great way to measure what
actually the plant is seeing in the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do soil tests, you can see,
well, this is what we have in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tissue analysis tells you what the
plant is taking up from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kathy's going to talk to you a little
bit more about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two basic times that you would
look at testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the routine measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have an established
planting, you take samples every three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, you look at the results,
you make some minor modifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding phosphorus when it's needed or
modifying the pH if it's needed,
[SPEAKER_00]: either down or up, depending upon the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or if you have a situation where you
have no history of a site at all and you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan on putting a planting of perennial
berry, like blueberries, into an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great opportunity to do that soil
test at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of the routine types of tests
that are conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a chance to use soil
testing and foliar analysis to do
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic work when plants are not doing
as well as you think they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one piece of information
that you can use to help come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: answers for local growers to actually
identify what the problem is on the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually this is done with doing some
paired sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a series of samples in an area
that is just not performing up to par and
[SPEAKER_00]: then comparing them with at least the
results of those chemical analyses with an
[SPEAKER_00]: area of the field where you have
reasonable performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these situations, adding soluble salts
and analysis is probably an important
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using plant tissue analysis just gives
you that additional piece of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use in answering a battery of
questions and narrowing down the field to
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important to look at how you'd
want to obtain a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the problem identification,
you can see that by the green arrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's an area of sweet corn in this case
that's not performing very well and yet a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the rest of the planting is
doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an opportunity to take some
samples to identify what the problem might
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in sampling these areas, you'd want to
take a series of samples from the area
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not performing well and you should
take a minimum of eight subsamples that
[SPEAKER_00]: are then mixed together as a single sample
from both the problem area as well as the
[SPEAKER_00]: area that's more representative of good
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one sampling strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important thing to consider when
you're sampling is actually to see sample
[SPEAKER_00]: by management unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can picture your farm and you can
picture block planting of that farm over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would want to first look at the soil
types that are underneath these plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are major changes in soil
type, to actually sample within those soil
[SPEAKER_00]: types because there can be very big
differences in their ability to hold on to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, the amount of lime or sulfur
that's needed to change the pH depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on the texture differences between those
soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, you may have a planting
of strawberries that's newly planted and
[SPEAKER_00]: that should be sampled separately than
plantings that are two and three years
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even within those plantings,
maybe have different varieties planted,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be considering them as
management units and doing sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: separately for those management units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using it as a diagnostic tool is
yet the other method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about a sampling of soils for
chemical analysis, there are different
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use various extractions to estimate
how much plantable nutrients are in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the values that you can get from
the same sample can be very different from
[SPEAKER_00]: different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing to take home out
of that is not to take values from one
[SPEAKER_00]: lab's results and try to make
recommendations using another lab's
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in New York State, the recommendation
is to go with Cornell soil sample analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is being conducted by a private
firm, Dairy One.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you get the power of the
university and all the trials that are
[SPEAKER_00]: conducted and the information gleaned from
those trials and the recommendations that
[SPEAKER_00]: come from those trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AgriOne is the place to go in New York
State, mainly because you get the benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Cornell recommendations which are
based on research results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a certain set of sampling tools
that can be used in obtaining soil samples
[SPEAKER_00]: in the upper right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a series of those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an auger, a soil probe head,
and you can see that they're made from
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the important things to avoid is
contamination of the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use steel shovels, spades to
obtain the sample and they haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: cared for and there's some rust on them,
that can actually contaminate the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to think about when you're
taking a sample is you're trying to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the situation as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just a sample from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to the same depth consistently,
making sure you have the same volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that's obtained at each site,
and then mixing each one of the sub
[SPEAKER_00]: samples to come up with a composite for an
entire area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things give you good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got too much sample from one site
and not enough from another, now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually weighing the sample results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have sufficient numbers
of samples, you can definitely have some
[SPEAKER_00]: errors in the information that you're
gonna get from the sample results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to consider is to make sure
that you're using a plastic bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some buckets are made from zinc and zinc
can contaminate the sample as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third thing is make sure that
you're using the appropriate forms and
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate procedures in putting together
the sample to send it off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking a little more closely at the soil
probe, this is a favorite among a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's a favorite is you
have this tube that's attached to a tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can press this into a soil,
get a nice core sample to the depth that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're that you wanna go to, clear this
tube, and then move on to your next site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under good conditions, so that's not
too wet, not too dry, and definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: rocky or gravely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people use this particular
device to obtain samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say one of the things that I do is
whatever depth I'm going to for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, I'll measure it right on the probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll put a piece of electrical
tape around the tube at that height so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I consistently go to that same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the auger, the auger is a great
tool under rocky and wet conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too wet and you use the soil
probe, anybody that's done this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you press it in the ground, you pull it
back up and only half the tube is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: filled because you actually compress the
soil when it was wet and you didn't get a
[SPEAKER_00]: full tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under wetter conditions, the soil
actually adheres to the auger and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: run your hand down the auger to clear that
and you've got a reasonable sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing can be done with the auger
where you measure, let's say eight inches
[SPEAKER_00]: from the tip to the top and put your
electrical tape there and then you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to that depth
consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another benefit of this device of the
auger is that you can actually set them up
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can put them on a power drill
if you're doing a lot of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some thought has gone into this where
people have cut a hole inside a container
[SPEAKER_00]: like a bucket, a plastic bucket and
actually run the auger right through the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket, through the hole into the soil and
bring it back up and they clear it right
[SPEAKER_00]: there and the sample's trapped in the
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty efficient way of sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: As was mentioned before, you definitely
want to take at least a minimum number of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples to get a good representation of
any given area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that you should consider is
never do sampling in let's say straight
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of times we are running in
straight lines up and down fields with our
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, with fertilizer, and planting,
maybe doing drainage work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sample over that same area
consistently across the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually are not representing all of
the rest of the area and you may actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be tainting the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually the recommendation is to zig
and zag across an area to obtain a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you're getting a good
representation of the entire area.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start sampling, you always remove the
organic debris that's at the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: because that will change the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make sure that you know the depth at
which you should be sampling for the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're actually sampling for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would definitely be different
depths for tree fruits versus small fruits
[SPEAKER_00]: versus things like field crops and turf
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you know the depth for
the crop that you're actually sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely take 8 to 10
subsamples at a minimum in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: anything less than 2 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything greater than 2 acres,
you should have 10 to 20 subsamples as a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: In larger acreages, you want at least a
minimum of 3 subsamples per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sampling for berries, both pre-plant
and established plantings, you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: down to 8 inch depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in established plantings,
you want to pair up the soil sample
[SPEAKER_00]: results with tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kathy will talk to you a little bit
more about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional guidelines, remember to remove
that organic mat to go to the depth that's
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking each subsample, putting it into the
plastic bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of sampling a particular area,
mix well because now that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: represent that area and then you subsample
from it to get your sample to send off to
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sample is too wet, then put it on
something like a plastic plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a fan on it to air dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avoid using any kind of heat source
because that can definitely skew the
[SPEAKER_00]: results, especially nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make sure that you put it in the
appropriate container for the lab that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sending it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that your forms are
completely filled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they use that information in
making the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, they have mapped the
soils out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually done it in the whole US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they use the soil names in New York
State to provide information about yield
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity of the site and some of the
physical attributes of the soil and its
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to hold on to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to put the soil series
name on the form indicating for the area
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're sampling for your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a valuable piece of
information that adds into the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you won't get a recommendation
without having that information on the
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go online and use websoilsurvey
.nrcs.usda.gov and get the soil survey for
[SPEAKER_00]: your form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then specifically get down to the
field level and indicate what soil series
[SPEAKER_00]: name is most predominant in the field or
the area that you're intending to sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually an iPhone app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get this from this
presentation and actually use that to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil name for your particular
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or if you don't want to go either of
those routes, you can go to a cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: extension office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often they have copies of the same
materials and can help you to identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil name for your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interpreting the results can be
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to an out-of-state lab,
they might send you results back just
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating the pounds of particular
nutrients that are tested in the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: and no recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's important to really
use the lab that's in your state that is
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with a local land-grant
institution and can provide
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a simple thing like checking your
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have to have the
information ahead of time that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing strawberries or raspberries that
the pH that is recommended that's optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: for those crops is between 6.2 and 6.5
versus blueberries much lower at 4.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the results and say,
okay, are my macronutrients, do they fall
[SPEAKER_00]: into the medium range or above?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, then I need to make some
adjustments in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the recommendation on the soil
sample results.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your soil organic matter content?
[SPEAKER_00]: For most berry crops, it's recommended to
have 3% or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is one of those things if
you test the site beforehand, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to actually build up organic matter
levels if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calcium levels are very important for
blueberry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recommendation is when you're
looking at a Cornell soil test results
[SPEAKER_00]: through AgriOne that calcium be below 2000
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aluminum can be toxic at higher
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a reading of 300 pounds of
aluminum in your sample per acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is a situation that you're going
to have to correct very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can occur more and will occur
more under acid soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely there's a recommendation
not to use any kind of aluminum based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick word about soil pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this graph, it's one that
probably you've seen before that indicates
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of some major necessary
nutrients for your plant growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows the wider the band,
the more available those nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in the pH range of
let's say 6 to 7, you find that most
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients have a high availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go towards strongly acid,
the availability of many nutrients falls
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can affect the performance of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if the pH gets driven way up,
you can have that same situation at least
[SPEAKER_00]: for a series of these nutrients that are
necessary for crop growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important for you to
understand that relationship and how
[SPEAKER_00]: important it is to have the pH in the soil
at an optimal level for the crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're modifying soil pH,
one of the things that you should be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of is that it isn't instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just apply lime to increase the
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sulfur to decrease the pH one day and
have the pH change by the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's a long-term process and
takes from six months to nine months to
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is better that you pre-plan,
do the testing beforehand, make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments in pH through these
applications, and do that nine months or
[SPEAKER_00]: more in advance of actually planting the
intended crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want more information on this,
you can go to the Production Guide for
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy Crops put out by NRase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you might expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you would get from Dairy One
as far as a results form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they have a nice
graphic in the upper right, which shows
[SPEAKER_00]: you very low, low medium, high,
and very high levels of some of your major
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, for instance,
that phosphorus is in the low-medium level
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably would need to be built up
with additional applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is already high, so pretty
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium, we talked about that 2,000 pounds
of calcium per acre being an indicator of
[SPEAKER_00]: at least above that being a problem for
blueberry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, 6.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at strawberries as the
intended crop, we're close to the range
[SPEAKER_00]: that's recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then organic matter, we talked about
the fact that you wanted 3% or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, you have 4.6%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum, we said that you had to have 300
pounds per acre or more to have problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with toxicity from aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like we're OK in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen recommendations from this sample,
100 pounds of nitrogen total to be split
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 pounds in July, 20 pounds in the
following September, and then 25 pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus fertilizer at planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to bringing those
nutrient levels up to recommended levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil test results will tell you,
OK, you need so many pounds of P2O5 or
[SPEAKER_00]: K2O, potash or phosphorus, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, when you talk about organic
versus conventional, it's just the source
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the percentage of nutrients found in
organic fertilizer is usually lower than
[SPEAKER_00]: those found in conventional fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're told to put on 30 pounds of
nitrogen, then you just have to put on
[SPEAKER_00]: more material of the organic type of
fertilizer to achieve the same 30 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen contribution to that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have two really, really,
really good guides, the organic strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: and organic blueberry production guides,
to help you find sources of fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring those soils up to spec for
optimal production of those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I think I'm going to be
turning this over to Laura for further
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion about the Cornell Soil Health
Test.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked a little bit about one aspect
of the Cornell Soil Health Test,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was thinking about the chemical
evaluation of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a higher level of testing involves
evaluation of biological and physical
[SPEAKER_03]: properties of the soil, in addition to the
chemical ones that Jeff explained.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are measured in the standard
soil nutrient test.
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of the components, biological,
physical, and chemical, interact to
[SPEAKER_03]: provide conditions that could lead to
optimal plant performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chemical properties are the most
understood, and they're the easiest to
[SPEAKER_03]: modify of those three.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we can also influence soil physical
and biological properties to enhance plant
[SPEAKER_03]: performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the Soil Health Test is so
valuable, because it gives us some idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: what some of those constraints might be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a slide that explains a little
bit the Cornell Soil Health Test was
[SPEAKER_03]: developed by the Cornell Nutrient Analysis
Lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a whole team of folks that
work on soil health at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just agronomists, but horticulturists,
soil scientists, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they came up with the Cornell Soil
Health Assessment Training Manual,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can order this online.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's downloadable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very helpful for folks that are
just beginning to understand what soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health could mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the address and the website that
you can get more information about this
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's basic packages and standard
packages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the basic is really for grain and
forage crops and other non-agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: applications, especially used for
landscaping and site remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us with specialty crops,
the standard package is what we are
[SPEAKER_03]: recommending that you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is used a lot in vegetable
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic producers are very interested in
this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some problem diagnosis, again,
in landscaping and urban applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for berry crop growers and tree fruit
growers, especially perennial plant
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, the best time for us to take
advantage of what the soil health test can
[SPEAKER_03]: offer is for first time soil health
assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So soil health is the capacity of the soil
to function chemically, biologically,
[SPEAKER_03]: and physically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're going to explore a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what the soil health test will
make sure that folks understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So characteristics of healthy soils
include good tilth, sufficient but not
[SPEAKER_03]: excessive, amounts of nutrients,
a sufficient rooting depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthy soil has good water storage and
also excellent drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are very important in berry crop
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is free of chemicals that might harm
plants and has relatively low populations
[SPEAKER_03]: of plant disease and parasitic organisms,
but high populations of beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthy soil has lower weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has some resistance to being
degraded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of these help it become more
resilient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a capacity to recover quickly from
adverse events.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are characteristics of healthy
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some characteristics or signs of poor soil
health include when you plow up cloddy
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and you have poor seed beds,
those are signs that you might have poor
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have hard soil at planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tends to kind of get that surface soil
hardness on it, which is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be rapid onset of stress or
stunted growth during dry or wet periods.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a sign of unhealthy and poor soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can also have poor growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vigor on the plants is just not great
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might see in poor soil declining
yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually is one of the biggest
tip-offs to growers that there's something
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their yields just keep going down
regardless of how much fertilizer or
[SPEAKER_03]: organic matter they might be adding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this also can exacerbate high disease
pressure when you get poor vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times diseases take advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you might see signs of runoff and
erosion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are pretty obvious poor soil
signs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the interactions, and this is
what the soil health test will help
[SPEAKER_03]: delineate or help make obvious,
is some of the things that they will
[SPEAKER_03]: indicate to you will have interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hard soil reduces rooting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be compacted dense soil layers
restrict rooting volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the plants are not able to
exploit water and nutrients the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compacted soil can also suppress
beneficial biological processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you see in blue is the physical
attribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in green, nutrients and root
diseases and denitrification all are
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the yellow is the biological.
[SPEAKER_03]: So poor drainage reduces rooting and
aerobic biological processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the compaction, which a hard
soil, often you'll have compaction,
[SPEAKER_03]: that will increase root diseases and
denitrification losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an example of all three of the
characteristics, the soil characteristics,
[SPEAKER_03]: having an interaction around hard soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the things that the Cornell
soil health test will do is that there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: battery of tests that are employed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these are done in the soil
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photos of the suite of analyses,
the soil physical tests are in the blue
[SPEAKER_03]: across the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all laboratory tests except the
field penetration test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about using that soil
penetrometer a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the biological tests are in green
across the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil health lab uses a modified Morgan
extraction solution to determine soil
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the soil texture determination is
also used to categorize test results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell soil health test guidelines,
and this is just some things that you will
[SPEAKER_03]: need in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I find that it's easier for me
to take this test if I have an assistant,
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody to help carry some of the gear.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're alone, you'll definitely
need two five-gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them would be for soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gather much more soil in this
particular test than you do for a chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: soil analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a large one-gallon Ziploc bag to
put all of this soil in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a soil sample in at the end of
the gathering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll want a 600 mil or plastic beaker or
three-cup capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll want a permanent marker and pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use a trowel or a spade, and I actually
use a larger kind of a tree spade type
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that helps a lot to gather that soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a soil penetrometer, a grower and
field information sheet, and a clipboard
[SPEAKER_03]: to hold that information on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this right here is an example of
that soil health field information sheet
[SPEAKER_03]: that you'll be filling out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are rather important guidelines,
and the sampling will be done roughly in
[SPEAKER_03]: the same manner for the standard chemical
soil, the nutrient soil test, with some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these exceptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to sample the soil in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the soil is at field capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that it needs to have enough
soil moisture to be tillable, but it can't
[SPEAKER_03]: be saturated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a difficult thing this
spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had such a dry April.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was difficult to get any kind of field
capacity in most soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it started raining like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil health test should ideally be
done before tillage occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes that's not an issue in a
perennial crop because we don't do a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you do want to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you want to have these soil health
test samples gathered before the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: June, because the lab stops analyzing the
samples sometime in July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So try to make the end of June being your
kind of cutoff date, if possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to use a trowel or a spade to
sample soil as a larger volume of soil is
[SPEAKER_03]: required for this test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I used kind of a tree spade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that allows me to gather kind of a nice
sample on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be making five stops
across the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be, again,
zigzagging kind of in that W type of
[SPEAKER_03]: random pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to collect two sub-samples at
each stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to mix those sub-samples
thoroughly and then put that into the
[SPEAKER_03]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: At each of those stops, you want to make
two penetrometer readings.
[SPEAKER_03]: One from zero to six inches and then six
to 18 inch depths at each sub-sample
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, if we go back to that form,
right down here is this area where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have push one and push two for
the surface and then the sub-soil samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be doing that for each
of those two locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you end up with quite a few readings
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to record that on the
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: After you've done this, you'll have at
least one and a half or six full cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's what the three cup
measurement is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take that, make sure that you
have enough, mix that soil into a Ziploc
[SPEAKER_03]: bag, label it with the field name,
the ID, and the date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, next you want to make sure to keep
that sample out of direct sunlight,
[SPEAKER_03]: putting it immediately into a cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you cannot get this shipped
right away, you want to put it in a cold
[SPEAKER_03]: room or a refrigerator the entire time
that you're shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will bring a cold pack in my cooler,
put that soil sample in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not let it warm up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason being that you don't want any
degradation of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want any organic matter to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also makes shipping somewhat difficult
because this is a rather large sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it still needs to be cooled during
shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to have to be aware that
you'll need some kind of a Styrofoam
[SPEAKER_03]: container.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably put a cold pack in if possible so
that the sample can remain cold during
[SPEAKER_03]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let your grower clients also know that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to need to pay for the
shipping.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is something to consider, especially if
you're doing multiple samplings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So interpreting soil health test results,
make sure to understand, and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that took me a while to
understand, that the report is a
[SPEAKER_03]: management guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no real hard and fast
prescription.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it does give you are those
readable data so that you can try to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out your management around the
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different management approaches can be
used to mitigate the same problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that you and the
grower would discuss quite a lot while you
[SPEAKER_03]: try to understand what's the easiest and
most efficient and also economical
[SPEAKER_03]: approach for the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addressing some of the soil
constraints, management practices can
[SPEAKER_03]: affect multiple indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of your things that you might do,
like using cover crops, might actually
[SPEAKER_03]: mitigate many different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And soil health changes slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing though to be aware of is that we
use this in a vegetable situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually were looking at things back to
back and we actually did see some
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement even in one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a long-term process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes they won't see changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's wonderful that now we have a tool
that we can kind of track these changes
[SPEAKER_03]: when they happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example of two soil health
tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can learn the effects of long-term
moldboard plowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're looking at here.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 years of fall plowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a corn for grain study on a clay
loam soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil physical properties have been
affected, as have the biological
[SPEAKER_03]: properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: A steady diet of corn stover has
maintained soil organic matter,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's impaired active carbon levels in
the no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: This field started out as an alfalfa hay
and we see that no-tilling maintained a
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy soil, which gives it the high
score, while the continuous tillage had
[SPEAKER_03]: measurable effects and results in the low
score.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see that this test on the left,
this is the aggregate stability,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is in a danger thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the red indicates of danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Available water capacities also in that
red danger zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surface hardness, it has a very excellent
rating, probably because of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the subsurface hardness, still you
have a subsurface pan, deep compaction
[SPEAKER_03]: resulting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic matter, the yellow indicates kind
of a warning sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at 3.9, which is the percentage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still seems like it should be good,
but for some reason it does not rate that
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Active carbon is very poor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's soil biological activity is low,
and potentially mineralizable nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_03]: also in that area, but the rural health
rating is still quite good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes some of these things,
you wonder, there doesn't seem to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: clear picture across the board in one
biological area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soil pH is a little bit, you know,
from a nutrient or a chemical aspect,
[SPEAKER_03]: 6.1 isn't bad, but they put it in the
yellow range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extractable phosphorus is a little bit
high, probably, so that puts that into a
[SPEAKER_03]: yellow area or caution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extractable potassium is fine,
and all of your minor elements are fine,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that rating gives it a low reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas on the right, the same kind of
situation, but they've done no till,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that all of the aggregate
stability, the subsurface hardness,
[SPEAKER_03]: the organic matter and the potentially
mineralizable nitrogen, things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: in the red areas now are green,
giving it a much higher rating,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the soil health then is deemed better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we aren't as lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times we have a no-till situation
just because berry crops are primarily
[SPEAKER_03]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: So approach for a successful soil
management strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to assess your soil's health to
identify constraints, and that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're recommending doing with the Cornell
Soil Health Test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be able to make changes in
management strategies that work for your
[SPEAKER_03]: farm and that address the specific
constraints identified in the Soil Health
[SPEAKER_03]: Test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be able to experiment on your
farm to see what works in your situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting small is helpful, and you should
be able to adapt the many resources of
[SPEAKER_03]: information that you glean from the Soil
Health Test to your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And build healthy soils to increase
resiliency to extremes, and that's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the overall goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now Kathy's going to talk about the
Cornell tissue analysis, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_03]: just tissue analysis in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Laura.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to take a look now at the
above-ground aspect of small fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: production, and we're going to look at
tissue analysis or leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kind of testing directly measures
the amount of nutrients in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some instances, as incredible as it
may seem, there may be sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients in soil, and yet leaves can show
a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about the reasons why that
may happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these sufficiency ranges have been
determined or estimated for small fruits,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes from other crops, sometimes
directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll be looking at those shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these ranges, when you fall into the
lower or deficient levels, alert you to
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient issues that are approaching,
are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And often, those can be caught before they
become critical and affect the yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: plant performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tests are also used to fine-tune
annual nitrogen application rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, there's a suggested application
based on the crop age, but you may need to
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust in your particular situation,
either higher or lower, depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these can also be used
diagnostically, as Jeff discussed earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: to rule out nutritional causes for poor
plant performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, sorry, wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these tests can also be done at the
AgriOne lab, and the information for the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tests previously were done at
Cornell at the Nutrient Analysis Lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they've been shifted to AgriOne so
that the Nutrient Analysis Lab can
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to do the research needed to
fine-tune the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this instance, you're looking for
the tree fruit and small fruit form,
[SPEAKER_02]: form P. And the report that you will get
will give you the Cornell nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: guidelines and the interpretation thereof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the samples run roughly $24 each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when would you need to collect leaves
for the analysis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, strawberry leaves are collected
after renovation, and we're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: the first regrowth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The youngest full-sized leaves,
and those are usually collected toward the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle to the end of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: For blueberries, these leaves are
collected just before or during harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're sampling from fully expanded
mature leaves from the middle of this
[SPEAKER_02]: year's shoot growth, and those that are
exposed to full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, these are collected in late
July and early August.
[SPEAKER_02]: For raspberries and blackberries,
you're collecting leaves from the
[SPEAKER_02]: primocanes, and you're looking for the
youngest fully expanded leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, they're collected in early
August.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you want to
remember, though, is that it's best to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid collecting leaves when the plant
resources are all being directed fully to
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit, because in a lot of instances,
those levels can fluctuate, and there may
[SPEAKER_02]: be sufficient nutrients in the soil,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the leaves may show a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is particularly true of potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to be sure to try to collect
when their plants aren't under a heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit load.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not always possible, but try to
avoid that whenever you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we collect the leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we want healthy leaves that are
well exposed to light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be representative for the
average condition of the planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try not to select leaves that are damaged
by disease, insects, weather, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: hail damaged or mechanical injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't mix leaves from different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Jeff talked about management
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try to keep your management
areas uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plantings of different ages, leaves from
those should not be mixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those should be separately sampled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want a minimum of two ounces of
fresh weight leaves, typically 30 leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: for each sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: If possible, try to collect each leaf from
a different plant within the sample area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then try to process your leaves for
analysis as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you prepare your leaves for analysis,
one of the things you want to do is use
[SPEAKER_02]: distilled water for washing and rinsing
the samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washing leaves removes dirt and residues
that can affect the test results,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's important to do so before they're
dried for shipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gently and lightly scrub the leaves
together in distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change the water if it becomes dirty,
or after eight to ten samples,
[SPEAKER_02]: whichever occurs first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shake the leaves gently to remove excess
water and then rinse the sample in clean
[SPEAKER_02]: distilled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, shake off the liquid and rinse with
another clean water sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lay these out on paper towels and
let them dry slightly before you put them
[SPEAKER_02]: in a paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to leave the top of that
bag open and dry the leaves at room
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature until they're brittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important not to let the leaves stand
in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try to wash and rinse them in
a minute or less if possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put them in plastic bags to ship
them or ship fresh leaves without drying
[SPEAKER_02]: because they often can deteriorate really
rapidly under those conditions and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: result in very poor test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the chart that I was telling you
about where we have the standard foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient ranges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want you to notice that when you
look, for example, at strawberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a range where the nutrients are
sufficient and then a range where they are
[SPEAKER_02]: deficient below a particular point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice across the top the
nitrogen is expressed in percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true all the way down to boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the ranges are expressed in parts
per million, or ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we look at strawberries,
you'll see that the ranges, if you compare
[SPEAKER_02]: those to raspberries, you'll see that for
the most part the ranges are pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the same for these two crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see there's not a lot of difference
between, for example, zinc at 20 to 50 ppm
[SPEAKER_02]: and the same for raspberries in the
sufficient range, 20 to 50 ppm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we compare, say for example,
strawberries or raspberries with
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries, you will see that blueberries
have significantly lower levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The critical values for blueberries are
quite a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have much lower nutrient requirements
than strawberries and raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: One exception to this, however,
is manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Higher manganese levels with blueberries
is not a problem as it might be with other
[SPEAKER_02]: crops because manganese becomes less
available as the pH drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see here blueberries are able
to tolerate manganese even at the 350 ppm
[SPEAKER_02]: range, whereas strawberries and
raspberries prefer a range of 200 or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's important to note that not all
labs will compensate for the differences
[SPEAKER_02]: between, say for example, strawberries and
raspberries and blueberries in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the blueberries having lower nutrient
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will often use the same
recommendations that they are using for
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries and raspberries with
blueberries because these recommendations
[SPEAKER_02]: are common across a wide range of crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they may be recommending an
addition of nutrients in blueberries where
[SPEAKER_02]: really they aren't necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one of the things you really
need to watch for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here's a typical plant tissue
analysis report from Farmer in the Dell at
[SPEAKER_02]: High Ho Dario Road.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're one to three years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're non-bearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the variety is Liberty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here, there's a nice
graphic that gives you the macro and
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bar graph shows when they're in range
or when they're low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically you get the most benefit when
you address nutrient issues that are
[SPEAKER_02]: falling in the low to deficient range.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you really need to make
corrective action.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're in range or in the high
range, that's when typically you won't get
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of change in plant performance if
you make those corrections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we look at this report,
we can see that both copper and iron are
[SPEAKER_02]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zinc is also low.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if we look at the soil levels
over here, the levels for those nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are adequate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would the problem be here?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go back and look at the soil test
results, which is why you want to really
[SPEAKER_02]: have a paired sample, you'll notice that
the pH here is 5.2, which is higher than
[SPEAKER_02]: you really would like for a blueberry
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: For blueberries, you really would prefer
4.2 to 4.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the pH reaches that level,
the available nutrients in the soil will
[SPEAKER_02]: become available, and those deficiencies
should correct themselves without even
[SPEAKER_02]: having to make an application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're interpreting your results,
be sure that the soil pH is within the
[SPEAKER_02]: correct range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assess the status of the planting to
determine if something other than
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients could be limiting growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, disease, insect pressure,
drought, other environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be sure to check the status of boron,
because that has an effect on other
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for specific nutrients that may be
deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check for interactions or imbalances that
exacerbate low nutrient levels,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then come up with your
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: When boron levels are low, that affects
root growth and development, limiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake of other nutrients such as calcium
and potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil levels of these nutrients may be
adequate, while leaf levels appear
[SPEAKER_02]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you correct the boron levels,
it will often correct the issues with the
[SPEAKER_02]: other nutrients without the need for
addition of supplemental calcium or
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing to note, as we discussed
earlier, is that fruiting takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil levels of this nutrient may be
adequate while leaf levels appear low.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is especially true as leaf sampling
often occurs not long after fruiting,
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing time for uptake and adequate
irrigation will replenish leaf levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium without the need of
supplementing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes high levels of soil nutrients
may also cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if phosphorus is too high,
it may restrict uptake of micronutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: such as zinc, copper, or iron or magnesium
by tying them up in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This frequently occurs in the case of
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another interaction is high calcium levels
in blueberry soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: This nutrient often ties up iron in the
soil, causing a foliar deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're interpreting tissue
analysis test results, there are some
[SPEAKER_02]: things to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the test results are not
meaningful for fertility guidelines unless
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil pH is within the correct range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember that soil test results do not
always correlate with foliar test results
[SPEAKER_02]: for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may have adequate nutrition in the
soil while there appears not to be
[SPEAKER_02]: adequate nutrition in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the reverse may also be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may appear to have adequate nutrition
in leaves but not in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue analysis tests are useful for
diagnosis but not for detailed guidance
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you consider all of the factors
involved, including growth and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And applying nutrients may result in a
decrease in foliar concentration under
[SPEAKER_02]: certain circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correcting deficiencies or imbalances in
established plantings is more difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: than amending soils prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really that pre-plant soil test and
soil amendment prior to planting is
[SPEAKER_02]: critical and often provides enough
nutrients, especially P and K and the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, for the life of the planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen is something that we need to add
annually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned that it's often determined
by the crop, the plant age, irrigation and
[SPEAKER_02]: mulching status, and the leaf analysis
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So often growers will say, okay,
my strawberry crop is two years old and so
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm applying 25 pounds per acre of actual
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you actually used your leaf
analysis results in comparison to the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: age, you might find that you had
sufficient nitrogen and you might be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to apply less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you might find that your nitrogen is
actually lacking in leaves and you might
[SPEAKER_02]: need to apply more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for more information on this topic,
you should check the Cornell Pest
[SPEAKER_02]: Management Guidelines for Berry Crops to
find the annual rates of nitrogen for your
[SPEAKER_02]: crop or the N-Race Production Guides for
more in-depth information on adjusting
[SPEAKER_02]: these to get the proper results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, in many cases, no additional P,
K, M, G or C, A will be required if the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil test recommendation were followed at
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may need to supplement K and potassium
and boron, especially on sandier soils
[SPEAKER_02]: because those have a tendency to leach
more quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And small amounts of sulfur may be
required to maintain a low pH in some
[SPEAKER_02]: soils where blueberries are grown,
especially if calcium levels are
[SPEAKER_02]: approaching 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf analysis provides guidance on
supplemental fertilizers after the
[SPEAKER_02]: planting is established and don't rely on
a soil test for post-plant recommendations
[SPEAKER_02]: that do not involve soil pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, the pH has to be at the correct
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in review, don't rely on visual
symptoms of what you've always done in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past in terms of berry soil nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to maximize your yield and
plant health before you plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: consider doing the Cornell Soil Health
Test, which includes the standard chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: soil test and more, the physical and
biological properties that Laura
[SPEAKER_02]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after plants are established,
use annual tissue analysis and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: testing every two to three years to
fine-tune your nutrient plan.
