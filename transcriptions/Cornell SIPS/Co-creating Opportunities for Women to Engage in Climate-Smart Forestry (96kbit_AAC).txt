[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, defining community,
great, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think community, you know,
we can use sociological framing
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, which I've done in the past,
but I think you'll see the community come
[SPEAKER_00]: forward as we move through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but what I'm targeting largely is
women in a rural context, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of private land ownership in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So women are often in ways have
opportunities to engage in climate smart
[SPEAKER_00]: forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the community, the platform in
which to reach this community is women
[SPEAKER_00]: owning woodlands, which is there's almost,
I think, a network in each state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is backed by the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest Service and the National Woodland
Owners Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project with Patricia and the
team is complimentary to my other
[SPEAKER_00]: extension program called Forest Owner
Carbon and Climate Education Program,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, I will, it's more broad in terms
of reaching landowners in general in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 13 extension institutions
that participate in contributing to this
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of co-creation of information,
climate smart forestry is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary, subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am the social scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I contribute in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking to kind of just help
bring more awareness and opportunities to
[SPEAKER_00]: forest landowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just sort of like an overview,
this is my one slide about climate smart
[SPEAKER_00]: forestry, but it's really about how to,
it's managing forests based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: current condition so that they can either
address mitigation, climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation, or are able to adapt to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forest management is key here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So active forest management and proactive
planning is often needed in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement any sort of mitigation or
adaptation strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forests are living systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest way to keep a forest to carbon
sink is to keep it healthy and to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, preventing land use
conversion and managing it to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: forest health is going to provide positive
benefits into the future, but it can also
[SPEAKER_00]: be managed to sequester additional carbon
that can be sold as offsets in a market
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and provide income for the
landowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all kinds of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem statement when it comes to
women and forest land ownership,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already highlighted that private forest
lands are expected to be key players,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 70% of the forests are privately
owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, land ownership has not been an
opportunity for a lot of women
[SPEAKER_00]: historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, now in the last few generations,
ownership of land has been, including
[SPEAKER_00]: women more and more, over half of couples
own land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so women are, you know, assigned
ownership, but usually the men have the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary decision-making roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just has to do with traditional
roles, once again, about whose jobs are to
[SPEAKER_00]: be outside and whose are to be inside and
these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So women don't often have these formative
experiences in forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I'll just point out that forest
land owners are generally around 60 years
[SPEAKER_00]: in age and women frequently outlive men.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are periods in which women come
into forest ownership unintentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can inherit land, you know,
they can get it from their husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more women are intentionally
buying forests, but this unintentional
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership is not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forested properties are at the highest
risk of mismanagement during that period
[SPEAKER_00]: of land transfer from one owner to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the risk of an unsustainable
harvest or land use conversion is most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about this, we want to get
women involved in forest management and
[SPEAKER_00]: also thinking in a proactive sense about,
you know, under climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the literature has shown with forest,
with women forest owners is that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: limited formative experiences,
low confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't feel like they belong in these
spaces because forestry tends to be male
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And programs are that, you know,
for training are usually geared towards
[SPEAKER_00]: men in the context that they're set up in
a way where, you know, the kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do I want to call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like power dynamic is more comfortable for
men than for women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so moving forward, we wanted to create
an extension program for women that was in
[SPEAKER_00]: a context that was more comfortable for
them, especially when there's low
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and kind of feeling like you
don't belong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll share with you our needs
assessment study we did and the co-design
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go over how we designed the
program itself and then give you some
[SPEAKER_00]: information of the data we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this program and we set it up for
Pennsylvania and South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the co-creation process,
but we've only collected data in South
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: My graduate student, Kripa Nupane did
interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So qualitative research with women forest
owners and the network that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating with and to understand how
they thought about forest and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to climate change,
women had very mixed opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a reminder, these women are
generally mature and rural and so
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And climate change is a thing,
but it's not the most pressing issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do they value about their forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: They really valued that it was a system
that supported multiple types of living
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provided services to society,
clean water, clean air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a place that was really important
for family bonding and being outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: being together was something that they
really valued about their forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the challenges were, again,
what we saw in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really know much about forest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even they're part of this network,
there's this low confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, if you're part of this
network, you probably know more than most
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but there was still this concern
like, I don't know a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Language barriers meaning terminology,
not understanding when someone says a
[SPEAKER_00]: select harvest, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can mean a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lack of capital in investing into their
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty common in land ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're land rich, but cash poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a lack of trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are professionals gonna take me
seriously when I go ask them for help?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we bring climate change information
to this group where climate change is not
[SPEAKER_00]: that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we began to, I got together with
some community members that are listed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent out a request for women to
participate in this co-design process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted them to sort of demonstrate
leadership as well as some experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: forest ownership, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other program leaders were my
colleagues in extension at Clemson and at
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Florida, as well as here at
Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a series of meetings in which
we shared with those community
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors the information from the
needs assessment, the literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the literature says.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shared with them what kind of resources
are available in extension, including
[SPEAKER_00]: climate smart forestry content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, how can we build a program that's
going to appeal to rural women and forest
[SPEAKER_00]: owners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the logic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it in there because that's how
we kind of built it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the next slides are gonna kind of
show you what that ended up being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we designed the program was
that it would be on legacy planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something all the women pretty
much get behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about protecting the forest
into the future as well as supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: their family in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so making it climate smart is just the
active management part of legacy planning,
[SPEAKER_00]: which involves some legal components to
and communication with your family members
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you wanna do in the future,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of them just didn't feel
very confident in their knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in forest management,
we knew we had to design an atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: that was gonna be safe and comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set up these objectives to provide
information to support understanding or
[SPEAKER_00]: support knowledge, language and motivation
around climate smart forestry and legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two topics, we kind of put them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide planning documents and we also
give them opportunities to network with
[SPEAKER_00]: peers and forestry professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we want them to ultimately
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about motivation, ability to plan and
being able to network with professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of our end goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the approach we designed was to foster
group discussions with women landowners
[SPEAKER_00]: that are led by their peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are spaces where there are no
professionals leading the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the women having conversations,
guided conversations, because we train one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their peers to guide it, but they get
to look at the materials, reflect on them
[SPEAKER_00]: together and do group work together to
come up with their plan and vision for
[SPEAKER_00]: their forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was implemented over three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will let you know on the logic model
here is what we expected to be the short
[SPEAKER_00]: term, mid and long term impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a really important
slide because we often get this sense
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, an extension, we need to teach
somebody how to do something and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: go do it and that's impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that is impact, that's sort of
like they already had to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation already and a lot of
experiences already in order to take
[SPEAKER_00]: action.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not talking about women who are
ready to take action yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they need really is to establish
their values and priorities for forest
[SPEAKER_00]: management, understand what is climate
smart forestry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is legacy planning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to find their voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to talk about it and they need
to be initiated into the forestry sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the group as being seen as a
legitimate contributor in the conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very much about early engagement
strategies and initiating people into a
[SPEAKER_00]: space where they historically have not
necessarily been welcomed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the long term impact is that
landowners are more engaged and that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to get incentives from
climate smart forestry, be they from the
[SPEAKER_00]: state or from a private sector,
that those incentives are more equitably
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we had it set up is that there
are the FOSSE program or this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: project, we provide the platform in which
to manage these discussion groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our collaborators, in this case,
it was Clemson Extension Services,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were the ones that brought the people
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to sort of like describe it a
little bit more cogently here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we provided registration services,
the assignments and discussion guides,
[SPEAKER_00]: the extension resources library,
and evaluation of their program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our collaborators at Clemson
distributed the invitations for these
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion groups within their network,
held meeting spaces, and identified
[SPEAKER_00]: forestry professionals to invite and also
help to develop the materials that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of different
participants in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the facilitators who are training
the group leaders who are, setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions with the learners,
the forest owners and their families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the forestry
professionals that come at the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is what I do and this is how you
can contact me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did require quite a bit of materials
had to be created, but the content,
[SPEAKER_00]: the training part was already in existing
extension materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was more we had to set up the
registration, we set up a quiz to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: women understand their priorities for
forest management and then these
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion guides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kinds of materials and
the evaluation surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the kinds of materials that were
generated from this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here in stage one,
we're assembling the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a Qualtrics survey to have
forest owners register.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a letter of invitation from their
extension network leader and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's a program if you'd like to be part
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come to Qualtrics and register and
part of the Qualtrics registration process
[SPEAKER_00]: included the forest values quiz to help
them understand their priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also was a section where they could
volunteer to be a peer group leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would attend a separate
training to prepare them for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-step quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, they list what do they like about
their forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it covers a wide variety of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystem services, as well as community
benefits, meaning just being part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: forestry community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did is they listed what they
thought what they like about forest and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what they were concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to compare the two to help
them identify some priorities because if
[SPEAKER_00]: they thought it was important and they
were concerned about it, that should be at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of their list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why people don't
really start thinking about a management
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where do I start?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is my goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really trying to help them
set those priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the curriculum was contribution from
multiple institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clemson had a lot of great materials just
on basic forest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have Penn State and Clemson had
resources, extension resources on legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: planning, tips for how to conduct what it
is, and then tips for how to engage in
[SPEAKER_00]: that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, my program,
the Forest Owner Carbon and Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Education Program, had plenty of articles
on climate smart forestry and carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our library of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we got together and we
said, this is what people valued in that
[SPEAKER_00]: quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just basically put together a
package of articles for the women to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the individual activity that the
women engaged in before the group activity
[SPEAKER_00]: was to review the reading assignments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just two or three articles,
short articles, that they would review
[SPEAKER_00]: before getting together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they met in Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we had our group discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the peer leader would guide them
through some planned questions that helped
[SPEAKER_00]: them kind of articulate what it is that
they learned, what was of interest to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and then how would they apply what
they learned to what their priorities are
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as on that priorities quiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a forest visioning plan where
they would document their conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were private documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could share them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really open-ended how the group
wanted to engage with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end, they would get to
meet with forestry professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in South Carolina, they got to meet
with their state forester.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also got to meet with some forestry
extension professionals and one carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: markets person, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got to see, hey, these are real
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all happened to be women too,
which was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they knew who to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I have a question about my forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who to call because I met this
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an evaluation survey at the
end, which is what I'll share with you
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 people responded to the survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a poster here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to share it if anyone's
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just sort of as a summary,
most people were curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just wanted to explore options,
which is why they got involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion groups, which is great because
that's the purpose of those discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: groups was really kind of to broaden their
exposure to climate smart forestry and
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the scalar questions that we use
to measure that collaborative learning
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, that group work, that
collaborative learning experience has both
[SPEAKER_00]: psychological as well as academic kind of
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the left table here,
these statements measuring collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: learning benefits were just about the
conversations about legacy planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so participants felt free to
communicate their opinions on a scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mean score four means that generally
everyone agreed that they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate their opinions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, most people agreed they
enjoyed listening to other people's point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their understanding was broadened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them felt like they learned
something from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they feel more comfortable about
talking with their peers about these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would say the legacy planning
definitely, I mean, this is some
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging stuff to talk about when
you're going to die and who's going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what with your forest and what do you
expect from your children?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are not light topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that they enjoyed
themselves and felt like they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate is really a great impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving over to forest carbon and climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was all scores above four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an enjoyment talking about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we get together and have
these conversations, there is more
[SPEAKER_00]: optimism than kind of learning about it in
the news or having it pointed at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to verbalize your opinions
and views on what can be a challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: topic is really can be a positive
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's change and perceived
knowledge, attitudes, confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it was on a five point scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Patricia's slide,
it was the score before and the score
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for a change,
hopefully in a positive direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the legacy planning, confidence in
understanding legacy planning topics
[SPEAKER_00]: increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pleasure of learning about these
things increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfort about talking to their family
about legacy planning also increased and
[SPEAKER_00]: making decisions in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went up a whole point on a five
point scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, an increase on forest carbon and
climate change topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one had a little few more
questions that related to climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple more questions that related to
communication to different categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like their community, to their family,
to contributing to mitigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation strategies, increase in
understanding, increase in like enjoying
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about the subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the biggest changes was the
skills to talk to family and friends about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that's so great because one
of, we cannot move into a society that
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses climate change till everybody,
most everybody's on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that involves talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now climate change is sort of
like a tabby word and a lot of more
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative or traditional communities
because it has so much uncertainty about
[SPEAKER_00]: it and among other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So encouraging people to talk about it is
just really, really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm gonna finish up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one of my favorite comments is
this big one here where the respondent
[SPEAKER_00]: said she only really thought about her
forest in two different ways, but now she
[SPEAKER_00]: was looking to expand to think more about
interested in the forest landowner
[SPEAKER_00]: community and in habitat management,
which is great because before she was just
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in income and non-timber forest
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The comment down below here said that her
brother was the one that talked to the
[SPEAKER_00]: forester, but now she's like, I know some
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, great, she's entering the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence of being willing to now
enter that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other two comments basically
are talking about how they liked the
[SPEAKER_00]: system that helped them set up their ideas
and start making a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we learned is that climate change
solutions should help advance the values
[SPEAKER_00]: and goals of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put the legacy planning first and then
built the climate change curriculum with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have trust issues when working
with women in an extension context.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, that's not the barrier,
but I will say there was a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in there was concerned about
the political agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came up and there was a difference
based on age and why is it we're focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on women.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just, was an interesting
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk more about it if you want,
but it wasn't a really barrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was definitely questions like,
why are we asking women about this or
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved just women's only groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing is don't discount the
value of initiating people to take part in
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that concludes my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in doing something
like this in your community, I can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly be of help.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a system in place and this
co-design process is just part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we're building it all the time,
depending on which group discussion groups
[SPEAKER_00]: we're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is my favorite event so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just even talking about providing
childcare in order to have families come
[SPEAKER_01]: or helping people find their own voice in
a new field of consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very common sensical things,
but sometimes we forget them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to applaud you both for
bringing those very real pragmatic things
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fore so that we can really engage
the collective force because I do think
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a common sense to climate change
and I can see that you are really,
[SPEAKER_01]: both of you are really beginning to nail
that common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and I wish I hadn't used the word
nail, but you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that this is the first time I've
done any research that's like gender
[SPEAKER_00]: specific and working in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's so valuable because
they're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The women are right there on the forest
lands and all they have to do is just say
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we just think about this, this way,
dad?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about this brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, yeah, once again, it's like
defining the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not this huge, I mean, there are
underserved communities that have
[SPEAKER_00]: significant socioeconomic constraints,
but then there's others that can also make
[SPEAKER_00]: a real difference where it's just about
increasing their confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something that I've been
learning to appreciate is the nuance,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, that's different for every
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like Patricia, how the Latino
community is just so like, let's have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this about family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, isn't that, it's just so
different everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being sensitive, culturally competent,
I guess, is the word to make that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the program so that it feels like their
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think it's neat, Melissa,
how you're thinking about legacy planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't really even occurred to me how
hard it is to broach that subject,
[SPEAKER_01]: let alone think about how to manage land
that results from that subject or think
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to manage that land that results
from that subject to have a long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: climate impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's so many temporal layers,
which you made very clear in your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, but it's also just so
poignantly present, like the decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: that one makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's just, I'm curious in
terms of cart and horse, did you come
[SPEAKER_01]: first to the legacy planning or were you
coming from climate and then you realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that legacy planning was this interesting
co-joiner in a trajectory that needed
[SPEAKER_01]: attention and sort of climate just sort of
came along with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about my collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alison Muth is the leader in legacy
planning at Penn State here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I do the carbon climate
stuff where new money is coming in and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like, well, what is the number one
challenge of forest management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's making it financially
feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another challenge is at that land
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, forests exist on longer timescales
than humans do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the US average land 10
years, around 16 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people will own for like maybe 20
years or 30 years, but that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not thinking about the forest for
the next generation is self-limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it definitely in the context of,
yeah, forest under climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: the two really did make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just kind of separated parts
of extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, we'll put them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see there's a question from Lynn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am interested in doing a similar
approach with pollinator habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be working with South Carolina 4-H
youth development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to discuss further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also working with leaders with native
bees in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to think about how we could
build a collaborative architecture for
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lynn, you're in North Carolina and in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I understanding that or Washington DC?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the women community, is that,
I'm not sure which starting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community kind of working that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know it's easy to go like we got
to support pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defining the community, I guess would
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's room for all kinds of
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this event has gone over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm going to put Patricia's
email in the chat, but I think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: feel confident or comfortable contacting
any of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to close it out because I
didn't actually realize it was 4-06 and I
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to stick to our time limit so
everybody can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to remind everyone that aging
and climate is next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the registration in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give us feedback both about the
structure of the presentation today,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as any in the past, and also give
us feedback for things that you would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to be presented in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to cultivate a whole range of
perspectives on how to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody finds a friend to work with,
work for, and work on behalf and be
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired and be inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us know and join us at NECI.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to join us, I'm going to
call it quits right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my very best to you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a good day.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
