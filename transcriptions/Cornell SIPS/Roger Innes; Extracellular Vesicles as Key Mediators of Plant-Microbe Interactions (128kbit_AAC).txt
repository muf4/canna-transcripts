[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a pleasure for me to be
here, because I know so many of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be a lot of really
fun science to cover over the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a great morning already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it that you guys have your seminars
at noon and not at 4 o'clock, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: what Indiana University does.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 4 o'clock, the audience is asleep and
the speaker is falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by noon, I think this is a great
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my talk today is on these extracellular
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that know my history know
that this is not my expertise or my
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a new direction for my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's part of why I'm having so much
fun with it, because I'm having to learn a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of new biology to understand what
we've uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the excitement of going into
what really is a new field in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope to share some of that excitement
with you all today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason we got into this project all
stems from this EM image right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me zoom in just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an EM image that we took trying to
follow up on a result from a Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: group that was investigating the question
of how do plant cells die when you
[SPEAKER_00]: activate a defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic defense response I think most
of you probably know is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypersensitive resistance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's marked by rapid breakdown of cell
membranes and cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Japanese group had published a
paper suggesting that the key event was
[SPEAKER_00]: fusion of the vacuolar membrane,
which in this image, these are two
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis musifil cells that have been
infected with an avial and strain of
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thin layer here is the cytoplasm
in that cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extracellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were really interested in this
vacuolar membrane adjacent to the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were looking for fusion events
because that's what had been reported in
[SPEAKER_00]: this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used a technology called focused
ion beam scanning electron microscopy to
[SPEAKER_00]: take literally 300 serial sections through
an Arabidopsis leaf looking to see if we
[SPEAKER_00]: could find any of these fusion events that
had been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not find any of these fusion
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did find were these things,
which were really interesting structures
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't in the textbooks that I had
been brought up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I showed these images to a plant
cell colleague of mine at IU, Sid Shaw,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's really a great cell biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sid had been an undergraduate with Andrew
Stalen at University of Colorado Boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the people who was on my
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sid knew these as paramural bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you zoom in on those things,
they're really interesting because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane is broken down underneath
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the general thought from EM images
of these so-called paramural bodies is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are actually dumping vesicles
into the extracellular space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's cell wall here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the vacuolar membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cytoplasm is this thin little
shell right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these paramural bodies are pretty
large structures relative to the width of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that obviously takes some effort to
make that kind of structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the thing in three
dimensions, which you can do with this
[SPEAKER_00]: focused ion beam SEM, this is what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these, this is what it would
look like if you're swimming around in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuole looking out at the vacuolar
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things stick into that vacuolar
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these seem to be more abundant in
leaves that we had treated with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas compared to leaves that
weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed like they might be associated
with a defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now given this word paramural body,
I could search the literature to see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether anybody else had reported these
and described these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out they were well documented
in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970s in the context of electron
micrographs of powdery mildew barley
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, if we go back to this,
these sorts of structures you see
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting around penetration sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you some more images of that
in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that got us excited that we were onto
some defense response that had been kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of overlooked in the context, especially
of bacterial interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put one graduate student on it to
start working on it as kind of a high-risk
[SPEAKER_00]: project to see if we could learn more
about these vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, I challenged him to see
if we could purify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said I was excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I wanted to learn more about
electron microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, I went to University of
Colorado Boulder to see Andrew Stalen get
[SPEAKER_00]: his wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's retired at this point, but he was
still coming into his office every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at University of Colorado Boulder,
they have the Center for 3D Electron
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have expertise in
high-pressure freezing, which is a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: really preserve the integrity of membranes
during fixing cells of any type,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this image here is one that I took on
sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only data that I generated in
this whole talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm proud of this, so I talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see here is, again,
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a chloroplast that starts
granules.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But notice these vesicles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trapped between the cell wall and
the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out I had no trouble finding
these sorts of images.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's common to see vesicles stuck between
the plasma membrane and the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't even have to be infected
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seems to be something that's
happening all the time in mesophil cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this really made me think that it
might be possible to purify these things
[SPEAKER_00]: from the apoplast, from the extracellular
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we basically set out to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while in Boulder, talking to Andrew
and showing him this image and this image,
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew got excited about that and said,
well, those look like lomosomes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was another word that I didn't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched PubMed for lomosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't even in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was in Andrew's brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to his file cabinet and pulled
out this paper from 1967.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew's office has this wall of file
cabinets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knew right where in the file
cabinet this paper was from 1967,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this was is carrot cell culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's just beautiful EM images of
what they labeled a multi-vesicular body,
[SPEAKER_00]: opening up against the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it looked like these vesicles were
being now outside the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here are these multi-vesicular
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in the same paper,
there's this image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows in particular is lots
of vesicles now in the extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's another multi-vesicular
body that seems to be emptying its
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles out between the plasma membrane
and the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a junction of three cells,
again, lots of vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've literally known that plant cells
produce extracellular vesicles for over 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've just been observations in EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's really figured out what their
role was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what got me excited to try to
figure out, what are these things doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been, of course,
follow-up analyses of fungal-plant
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions where people are doing EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this paper here from 2006,
so now only 12 years ago, had some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful images.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Ralph Huckelhoven's lab in
Germany, if you know any of Ralph's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He works mostly on barley powdery mildew
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is shown here is the fungus
penetrating through the plant cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is epidermal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant's producing what's called a
cell wall apposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're also called papilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a buildup of membranous
material, callus, and other compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: people think of as a physical barrier to
penetration by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just kind of a cartoon
drawing of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see in this manuscript or
paper is these permeable bodies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: full of vesicles that seem to be dumping
their contents into the cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: apposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you see it here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are complex membranous
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is now a similar image,
but taken by a new collaborator of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard O'Connell, who has a lab at INRA
in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does beautiful high-pressure EM
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I think, are fantastic images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is shown here, again,
is plant cell, fungal cell, vesicle here
[SPEAKER_00]: between the plasma membrane and fungal
wall, in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importantly, the fungus is, this is called
toctocomunomethium on a bean leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus also is producing extracellular
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fungal cytoplasm, plasma
membrane, and these vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is similar to that previous image
from Barley, but now this is on a bean
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the papilla or cell wall
apposition, fungus trying to penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, lots of vesicles being produced
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certainly lots of EM data
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last EM in this series I'm
going to show you is this is now taken in
[SPEAKER_00]: my lab by my graduate student,
Brian Rutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cross-section through a
hostorium of powdery mildew infecting an
[SPEAKER_00]: arabidopsis leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an epidermal cell in
arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lobe of the powdery mildew
fungal hostorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of mitochondria here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extrahistorial matrix here,
so the space between the plant cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is over here, and the fungal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to note here is this
darkly staining membranous material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this looks like to me is
microvilli on an intestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've just hugely expanded the
membrane surface area at this feeding site
[SPEAKER_00]: for the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a compatible interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus is growing happily here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I interpret this as the fungus
inducing a massive outgrowth of the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane of the host cell to enhance
transport of materials from the host cell
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at this, this sort of
microvilli type structure, you can imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could easily pinch off vesicles
directly from the plasma membrane to make
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there may be two independent
ways to make extracellular vesicles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is direct pinching off a plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other is through this
multivesicular body, pyramidal body
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway that we was just showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond the EM, there's quite a bit of
other evidence before our work to suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: that extracellular vesicles are important
in the defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from a series of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Hans Thorndahl
Christensen's lab, who we've now started
[SPEAKER_00]: to collaborate with, where they were using
fluorescently tagged GTPases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with multivesicular bodies and
localizing them to sites of fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this was powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they showed that these MVBs that are
tagged with the GTPase marker accumulate
[SPEAKER_00]: at the penetration sites and seem to be
fusing with the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work that preceded that but is directly
related showed that since taxons required
[SPEAKER_00]: these same GTPases to function in the
context of penetration resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was work being done in both
barley and arabidopsis, where Paul's lab
[SPEAKER_00]: was looking for arabidopsis mutants that
became more susceptible to a barley strain
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, the barley strain can't even
penetrate an arabidopsis epidermal cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these mutants, which they call
penetration mutants, they found that the
[SPEAKER_00]: barley powdery mildew could get further
and actually form a historium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the mutants was a syntaxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be a large player
later in the story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that syntaxin, they showed in 2009,
in a really seminal paper, that syntaxin
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulated in this papillar matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that was important is that
syntaxins are proteins that mediate
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane-membrane fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are involved in mediating the
fusions of vesicles with the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, they're considered cytoplasmic
proteins but anchored to membranes by a
[SPEAKER_00]: C-terminal signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they were getting
outside the cell was puzzling because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not normally secreted through a
standard secretory pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a signal peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, they were showing that these
proteins were accumulating in this matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even suggested in this 2009 paper
that perhaps they're being secreted via
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they used the term exosome,
which is a common term used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalian field for extracellular
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really this paper that got
us really focused on this idea of figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: out if exosomes are important in defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the kind of questions raised by
this that we wanted to answer is,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do these vesicles contain?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what triggers their release?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we already had evidence that there
was some sort of regulation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the fungal penetration site was
a place of focus for release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, what is it they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what we embarked on trying
to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, all the work I'm going to
present from here on out is from a single
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate student, Brian Rutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has discovered all sorts of really
interesting things about these vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I jump into all that data,
let me just review what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalian world, because there's a lot of
excitement in the mammalian world about
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this comes a 2013 review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main excitement in the mammalian
world is that these vesicles contain small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's being shown here is small RNAs
being packaged into what are called
[SPEAKER_00]: intraluminal vesicles in these cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are multiversicular bodies or
multiversicular endosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These then fusing with the plasma
membrane, releasing their vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the vesicles being taken up by a
mechanism that's not clear yet into host
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those RNAs get released, and they affect
gene expression in the host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really hot topic in the
mammalian world now, because it turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all sorts of diseases that seem to
be mediated in part by extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, cancer cells release
vesicles with a different content of small
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs compared to a healthy cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seems to be functionally
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through some of the literature
on that shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I just told you,
so we'll skip through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the history of exosomes in the
mammalian world kind of dates back to just
[SPEAKER_00]: 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a plant audience, so you'll
appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew about these in plants a good 20
years before they discovered them in
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalian cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, plant biology is leading
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was kind of a seminal paper on
the mammalian side, where this group was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at receptor-mediated endocytosis
of transferrin and recycling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: transferrin receptor during red blood cell
maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply using immunogold to
label transferrin and showing that these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, which are normally on the
plasma membrane, would become endocytosed,
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in these intraluminal vesicles,
and then get dumped into the extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, it was thought of as a
garbage disposal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't generate a lot of excitement,
because who's interested in garbage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this discovery of extracellular
vesicles basically just kind of was
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly because it was just considered a
waste system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all changed, though, in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is just 11 years ago,
where this paper was published in Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell Biology that demonstrated that
exosome-mediated transfer of messenger
[SPEAKER_00]: RNAs, and especially microRNAs,
allowed exchange of genetic information
[SPEAKER_00]: between cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suddenly, this seemed to be a mechanism
for intercellular communication for
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that kind of set off a huge
renaissance on the study of extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next paper here, 2008, again,
Nature Cell Biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glioblastomas, so brain cancer,
microvesicles, transport RNA and proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: that promote tumor growth and provide
diagnostic biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been a really big deal for
the biotech industry, because the idea is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can simply purify vesicles from
your serum or even your urine,
[SPEAKER_00]: see what RNAs and proteins are there,
and then be able to say whether you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it turns out that when we pee,
there's lots of vesicles in our urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are companies that have already
been set up that basically are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a rapid urine-based biotech test
for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also involved in the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a relevant paper to our topic,
unidirectional transfer of microRNA-loaded
[SPEAKER_00]: exosomes from T cells to
antigen-presenting cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably a critical component of
how our innate immune system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses have learned to co-opt the exosome
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can make their own viral
microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like herpes virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've shown functional delivery
of viral microRNAs via exosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also involved in tumor metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exosomes released by melanoma cells
prepare sentinel lymph nodes for tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is before the tumor cell
moves, it's releasing these exosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spread out to the body, suppress
immune responses that might otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: control the moving cancer cell,
and then allow colonization of distant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in brain development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regulation of postsynaptic retrograde
signaling by presynaptic exosome release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually done in Drosophila,
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just mammalian cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brain-immune system interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you feel so crappy when you have
a cold and your thoughts are muddled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it may be all mediated by exosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer
of genetic information between the human
[SPEAKER_00]: hemopoietic system and the brain in
response to inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the few known mechanisms
for transferring genetic information
[SPEAKER_00]: across the blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart disease, secreted
microRNA-suppressed atherogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I think, a really interesting
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMP-regulated exosomes from Drosophila
male reproductive glands reprogram female
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out that when fruit flies
mate, the female does not want to mate
[SPEAKER_00]: again for several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That behavior change of not wanting to
mate is dependent on exosomes delivered by
[SPEAKER_00]: the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another fascinating aspect of
exosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the most relevant to this
talk is this paper from 2014, where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're working on nematodes in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they showed that exosomes secreted by
nematode parasites transfer small RNA to
[SPEAKER_00]: mammalian cells and modulate the innate
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually an observation that's
been known for a long time, that people
[SPEAKER_00]: infected with nematodes don't tend to have
problems with asthma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their immune system is suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's probably mediated by microRNAs
that are being produced by the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what's the evidence that there may
be RNA transfer by extracellular vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from this paper from Hailein
Jin's lab at UC Riverside in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine many of you saw this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: She showed that botrytis produces small
RNAs that can suppress plant immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they did in that paper,
they weren't looking at vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, but they were able to
immunoprecipitate plant argonaut proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: and show that they were bound to botrytis
small RNAs and that those small RNAs
[SPEAKER_00]: actually targeted plant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion from this science paper
was that botrytis fungus is producing
[SPEAKER_00]: small RNAs that somehow get across
botrytis plasma membrane, across the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane, and then interact with
the RNAi system in the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, this was a smoking gun to
suggest that extracellular vesicles might
[SPEAKER_00]: be mediated in transfer of small RNAs from
a fungus to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in whether it might work
in the other direction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hailein followed up on this paper two
years ago in 2016 with this paper showing
[SPEAKER_00]: bidirectional cross-kingdom RNAi and
fungal uptake of external RNAs confer
[SPEAKER_00]: plant protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in nature plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, she actually could use naked
RNA, apply that to botrytis, and show that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could silence botrytis genes just with
naked RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So botrytis has some ability to take up
RNA from the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had been known before this work
even that you can express double-stranded
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA in a plant that silences a fungal
gene, and it can work quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called host-induced gene silencing,
which again raised the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do those RNAs get out of the plant
into the fungal cell?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, and I think most relevant
to this talk, this paper also in 2016
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that cotton plants can export
microRNAs to inhibit virulence gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression in a fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually in cotton, in
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there what they showed was that if you
identify these potential targets in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus of the plant microRNA, mutate that
target so it's no longer a base pair match
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant microRNA, you then made the
fungus more virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was pretty compelling evidence
that these microRNAs really were targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: a fungal gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what have we actually done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've succeeded in doing is
purifying the extracellular vesicles and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out what's inside of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the person that did that is my grad
student, Brian, and this was his side
[SPEAKER_00]: project for the first year and then turned
into his full-time project once he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually figured out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is his protocol and if you're
interested in doing this yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian has put together a really detailed
protocol in bioprotocol complete with a
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it's relatively
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply submerge your leaves or roots,
it works for roots too, in a buffer,
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a vacuum to suck out all the air
from your tissue, release the vacuum,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sucks the buffer into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You then do a low-speed centrifugation
that gently squeezes the leaves so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: recollect the fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just intracellular wash fluid or
apoplastic fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We filter that to filter out any broken
trichomes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a relatively low-speed spin at 10,000
times G to, again, pellet any particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the key spin turns out to be at
40,000 times G.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fast enough to pellet the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're curious to see what was
left after that 40,000 times G spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been 100,000 times G and it turns out
there's a lot of stuff that comes down at
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 times G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important not to go straight
to 100,000 and the reason I mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: is if you read the mammalian literature,
that's standardly is what's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a low-speed spin at 10,000 and
then they spin at 100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that with plant material,
you'll get a lot of stuff that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to really clean it up, we take the
pellet from 40,000 times G and run it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: density gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, if you look at the pellet from
your 40,000 times G spin by transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: electron microscopy, so this is just
negative stain, you see these structures
[SPEAKER_00]: that look like beanbag chairs and that's
essentially what they are because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting these grids into a vacuum and the
electron microscope, they collapse and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stain sort of accumulates where it's
collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this size range here is around 50 to
200 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: P100 fraction has all this much smaller
material and if you do dynamic light
[SPEAKER_00]: scattering, you see the P40 fraction
averages around 120 nanometers whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: P100 fraction is down more around 15 to 20
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very different size particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of our activity is in this P40
fraction where the vesicles are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were confident that the P40
fraction was what we wanted when we did
[SPEAKER_00]: this experiment where we isolated that P40
fraction from transgenic plants that had
[SPEAKER_00]: GFP fusions to this PEN1 protein and the
PEN3 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned earlier in the talk that
Paul Schultz at Leifert's lab had isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: these plant mutants that had enhanced
penetration by barley powdery mildew on
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he cloned these PEN mutant genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was PEN1 and that turned out
to include encode one of these syntaxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proteins involved in membrane
fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: PEN3 is an ABC transporter protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had shown both of these accumulate in
papillae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they seem to accumulate outside the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, these seem like good potential
biomarkers for extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's shown here is the P40
fraction from the PEN1 GFP plant by
[SPEAKER_00]: confocal microscopy and it looked like a
starry night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really exciting for us
because that really indicated that these
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles were carrying PEN1 and PEN3 and
so consistent with our predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see whether the PEN1 was
really inside the vesicles, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we would predict based on the topology of
how these extracellular vesicles are
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to ask whether they're actually
inside versus outside, we did a protease
[SPEAKER_00]: protection assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just incubate the vesicles with
trypsin, you do not see any degradation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the PEN1 GFP fusion protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you solubilize the vesicles with triton
and then treat with trypsin, you
[SPEAKER_00]: completely degrade the PEN1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that simply told us that the PEN1
protein is actually inside the vesicles,
[SPEAKER_00]: not stuck to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: To prove to us and our reviewers that we
were not just getting contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles from inside plant cells,
we looked at a series of transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis plants tagged with different
YFP GFP fusion proteins that mark
[SPEAKER_00]: different vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a marker for Golgi,
this is a marker for plasma membranes,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a marker for late endosomes,
and this is a marker for early endosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look at the total lysate,
our antibodies detecting all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, you look at the P40 fraction,
the only thing that comes out is the PEN1
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other common endomembrane marker
proteins are not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was demonstrated that we did not
have a lot of contamination from vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: from inside the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also asked the question, would
induction of defense responses increase
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicle recovery from our apoplastic
fluid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we use salicylic acid to treat the
plants and then we from the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material, we isolated vesicles and
then just did a western blot, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot more of GFP PEN1 is what we're
looking at here from SA treated leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: versus non SA treated leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a second marker, we used a
protein that we had identified by mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec as being present in the vesicles
called patellin-1, and that also we could
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot more patellin-1 in our P40
pellet from SA treated leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very reproducible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always get at least twice, sometimes
three times as many vesicles from plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been treated with SA versus
untreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but what we really wanted to do was
to do mass spec on the vesicles and
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-seq on the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before doing that, we decided to
take the extra effort of really cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: them up by using a density gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's shown here is a fraction
from iodicinol gradient, and here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: density of each fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again GFP PEN1 as a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that this kind of one peak
across the gradient where the GFP PEN1
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pull these three fractions and then
look at them first by confocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a black and white image of
the confocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the high concentration of
vesicles in these fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like by negative
stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what it looks like by cryo-EM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you can see it,
but you can actually see a lipid bilayer
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at this vesicle down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just convincing ourselves that
these really are vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was again from this pulled
fraction that we went ahead and did mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spec analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we do that, what we see is a
really interesting collection of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unlike any other proteome that's
been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as it's mixture of proteins that
are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, there are proteins that
we'd expect to be associated with vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are all associated with
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RABGTPases regulate endomembrane
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tetraspanins are well-known proteins from
the mammalian exosome world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Syntaxins I've already been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: PEN1 of course was the marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anexins is another common class of
endomembrane trafficking proteins that we
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of interest to the pseudomonas,
people here, we also found RIN4.
[SPEAKER_00]: RIN4 stands for RPM1 interacting protein
4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really intensely studied protein
that is a target of several different
[SPEAKER_00]: effector proteins from pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be involved in regulating
secretion of callus among other
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was intriguing to us that it was
in these extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there were a number of
transporter proteins, including
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate transporters, which is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glucosinolates are important antimicrobial
compounds that brassicas produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also aquaporins and proton pumps,
actually in vacuolar ATPases, suggesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that these vessels may have some ability
to regulate their pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also stress response proteins,
LRR protein kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morosinases is quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morosinases are enzymes that break down
glucosinolates to release isothiocyanates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that we have both
glucosinolate transporters and morosinases
[SPEAKER_00]: would suggest that you might be able to
produce these isothiocyanates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one idea we have is that these might
be packaged into separate vesicles,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you probably wouldn't want to put
them in the same vesicle, because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be releasing these highly toxic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably don't want to do that
unless you're inside an insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to kill that insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important point about the proteome is
that we calculated 84% of the proteins we
[SPEAKER_00]: identified lacked a single peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are proteins that are,
by definition, in the apoplast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're getting out of the cell
through non-conventional protein
[SPEAKER_00]: secretion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes sense that they're getting
packaged inside vesicles inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, again, suggests that the way
proteins get loaded into these vesicles
[SPEAKER_00]: probably bypasses the standard ER signal
peptide-directed pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so as I mentioned, we can also do this
from roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done it on lots of different
plant species now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one simply shows that if we take
soybean roots, we can isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we use antibody directly to PEN1,
we see abundant PEN1 in the extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles from soybean roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is making us think that these
vesicles may play a role in regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions of the roots microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that soil-root interface, if roots are
secreting vesicles into that space,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may play a role in communication
between the microbes in the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one of our real foci over the last
12 months has been trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what sort of RNA these vesicles carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our first evidence that they actually
did contain RNA came from this experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: here, where we're using a dye that was
actually developed in the mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: exosome world to stain RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called XORed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we just stain our P40 pellet
with XORed, we see abundant staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we use vesicles that are from a GFP
PEN1 plant, we see all the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is there's a high
degree of overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these three dots here are white,
because they show up with XORed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they show up with GFP PEN1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this dot does not show up with GFP
PEN1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows up only with the RNA stain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is some evidence that these
vesicles are, in fact, heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't all contain exactly the same
proteins and RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they're not big enough that do
that even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we expect to see heterogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a nice example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is evidence of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're learning some very interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn the lights up before you all go to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing we've learned,
and it was kind of surprising to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the vesicles are highly enriched
in what we are calling tiny RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the small RNA world, most people
talk about microRNAs that are 21
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotides long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And siRNAs are 22 to 24 nucleotides long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see a large number of 12
nucleotide, 13 nucleotide, 14 nucleotide,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to explain the graph here,
the green bars is the RNA-seq data from
[SPEAKER_00]: the extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bars is RNA that we find left
over in the supernatant after we spin down
[SPEAKER_00]: that P40 pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there seems to be RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: In extracellular space, that doesn't
pellet the 40,000 times G.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may just be soluble RNA that's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that's getting out there is an
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then total RNA is just the small RNA
that you get when you grind up a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is typically the pattern when
you just grind up a whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of your RNA-seq reads are in that 18
and larger size range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same for the supernatant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's certainly not true for the EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EVs are preferentially packaging these
smaller RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they targeting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we expected to see lots of
microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see plenty of microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a total fraction of what's in the
vesicles, it's dwarfed by the siRNAs that
[SPEAKER_00]: target transposable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are reads that map to
transposable elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are reads that map to cDNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some ribosomal RNA and tRNA gets
mapped to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precursors refers to microRNA precursors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EVs are highly enriched for the loop
that's formed during processing of
[SPEAKER_00]: microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make a microRNA, it's
transcribed by polymerase II.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long precursor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It folds up into a stem loop structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microRNA gets cut out of that stem
loop structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these RNAs that are in the vesicles
preferentially contain the loop from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem loop structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what that means yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think it might be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be taking out the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it may also have a function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're trying to sort out
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said there are microRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at what the most abundant
ones are, they actually differ somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: from what the most abundant ones are in
the leaf overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the list of our top six
based on counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put asterisks by ones that are
particularly interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so MRI 162 was in the news last summer
when it was shown that it's particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant in bee bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bee bread is concentrated pollen that
bees collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feed their larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it was in the news is this
paper here in Plasgenetics showed that MRI
[SPEAKER_00]: 162 can suppress queen development in
honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, it's important for
maintaining worker status in a honeybee
[SPEAKER_00]: hive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being regulated by this plant's
microRNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps pollen is particularly rich in
MRI 162.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's being packaged into
vesicles that can be easily taken up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the queens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, by the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: MRI 159 and 166, those are the microRNAs I
talked about at the beginning of the talk
[SPEAKER_00]: that seem to target genes in verticillium
dahliae in cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the putative targets of these
two microRNAs that when they mutated in
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium, made the verticillium more
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's striking that these happen to be
the most abundant ones in our EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then MRI 161, that's a notable
microRNA because it induces production of
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called phase RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are siRNAs that are produced in a
phased pattern from an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: messenger RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been shown in one Beaumont's
group that those actually target specific
[SPEAKER_00]: genes in phytophthora and OMIZ pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just to suggest that these
microRNAs may well have a function in the
[SPEAKER_00]: EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they taken up by the fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is a really nice experiment
that Brian did in which he simply
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated transgenic plants expressing
PEN3 fused with GUS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PEN3 is the passive, the ABC
transporter with multiple transmembrane
[SPEAKER_00]: domains fused to beta-glucuronidase,
which you can detect using a colorless dye
[SPEAKER_00]: that turns blue in response to the
beta-glucuronidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, this is called Toctocom growing
on an Arabidopsis leaf, wild type leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no background activity of
beta-glucuronidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons it's such a great
marker for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see accumulation, I think
here, of blue dye in the spores of the
[SPEAKER_00]: colitoctocom that's germinated on this
transgenic Arabidopsis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that the GUS here is fused to
this ABC transporter strongly suggests
[SPEAKER_00]: that the fungus is taking up this plasma
membrane protein, EV protein, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do the same experiment with
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you see uptake of the GUS
activity by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really suggests that these EV
proteins are getting into the fungi when
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungi feed on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is simply a close-up of that last
image of the powdery mildew spore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see it throughout the
hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brian then took this colitoctocom and
simply germinated it on glass slides and
[SPEAKER_00]: added EVs directly to the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are purified vesicles from a PEN3
GUS plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the blue staining
when they're germinated in the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, no blue staining at all
when you germinate it just in the buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: alone without the EVs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like the spores take up these
vesicles quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 24 hours after applying the
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next question that Brian wanted
to address is, do they move systemically
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to address that, he did grafts with
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not an easy thing to do
because Arabidopsis stems are really
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't do this after you've had
too much coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way he does this experiment is he
takes transgenic PEN3 GUS seedlings and
[SPEAKER_00]: grafts shoots to a non-transgenic root or
vice versa transgenic root to a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-transgenic shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this looks for movement of the GUS
activity across the graft junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you do that, you clearly see
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is wild type shoot grafted onto
the transgenic root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the graft junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this blue color moving up
into the apical meristem region of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll focus in on this in a moment
because there's a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take a non-transgenic shoot,
graft it onto a root, and you can see this
[SPEAKER_00]: root is becoming heavily stained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's moving a long direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is about three weeks after
setting up the graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this with control plants, and there's
no background at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, again, really nice,
this GUS marker that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you zoom in, then on these graphs,
so this is the non-transgenic shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see is the GUS activities
accumulating in these newly emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and especially in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pokey things, those are the
trichomes on these newly emerging leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see some of the GUS activity
here in the petioles of these older
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was really interesting to us that
the GUS activity seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: preferentially accumulating in the
trichomes because the trichomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: defensive structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our hypotheses is that these
EVs actually serve to transport
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolates because they have these
glucosinolate transporters in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps this is a mechanism for
accumulating glucosinolates into
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also, this is now the non-transgenic
roots grafted to the transgenic shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it accumulating in root hairs,
which is one of the reasons I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: may well be involved in communication with
the root microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a negative control,
what we're currently using now is a fusion
[SPEAKER_00]: between the JAZ-1 protein and
beta-gluteronidase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So JAZ-1 is a regulator of jasmonic acid
signaling, a regulates MIC2 activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and importantly, it mostly accumulates in
the nuclei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no evidence that it ever gets
into extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shouldn't move via extracellular
vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do graphs with that,
we see absolutely zero accumulation in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really seems to be dependent on
fusion to this PEN3 protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lastly, what I want to finish up with
is one of the reasons we set up this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: system was so we could do genetics with
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now screening through mutants,
looking for mutants that are defective in
[SPEAKER_00]: either EV production or in loading of
proteins or RNA into extracellular
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of our first positive
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows is that we take a
double mutant in PEN1 and CYP122.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are homologous snare proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is that they're defective in
loading this patellin protein into the
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing you the data, but this
mutant produces the same number of
[SPEAKER_00]: vesicles as a wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to be defective in loading in
this patellin protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do mass spec on this to figure
out what else is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know for sure this protein is
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice the CITU mutation is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason that is there is it turns
out if you mutate both of these syntaxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn on SA biosynthesis and you get a
stunted plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to avoid the stunting, we needed to
down-regulate the SA biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to add the CITU mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this kind of gives you an idea
of our approach to start trying to dissect
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically what's required to produce
EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat to our surprise so far,
we've tested probably 15 different mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are known to be defective in
different aspects of endomembrane
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This double mutant is the only thing where
we've seen an effect so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't found a single mutant yet that
affects the number of vesicles that are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So major questions that this work
generates are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these multivisical bodies are destined
for plasma membrane fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they fundamentally differ from those
that are destined for lysosomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the same effect on endome and
vacuole fusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that know a little bit
of cell biology, multivisical bodies have
[SPEAKER_00]: classically been studied as vehicles for
transporting plasma membrane receptors to
[SPEAKER_00]: the central vacuole for degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that those multivisical bodies
are probably an independent pathway from
[SPEAKER_00]: the multivisical bodies that go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not a generally accepted
feeling in the mammalian world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I believe that's the case,
at least in plant systems, is that by EM,
[SPEAKER_00]: the multivisical bodies look very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that's the case, we need to
figure out really what is the pathway that
[SPEAKER_00]: gives rise to these MVBs if it's
completely different from the pathway that
[SPEAKER_00]: classic MVBs involve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are proteins targeted for import
into EVs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are escort proteins involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are autophagy genes involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, some toxins are involved based
on that one result I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these small RNAs, especially the
tiny RNAs, how are they targeted to EVs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are they distinguished such that
only a subset of cellular small RNAs are
[SPEAKER_00]: packed into EVs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't show you the data, but some
microRNAs are highly enriched in EVs
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they targeted to specific
recipient cells, such as trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of a mechanism for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really interesting to try
to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they taken up by fungal cells and
plant cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're taken up quickly by these
germinating spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that mediated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there specific surface proteins
required for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they mediate transfer of sRNAs and
proteins into plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the guess, they certainly mediate
transport of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to actually do some tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they mediate intracellular signaling
during defense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that they do, but we don't have
any evidence for that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they mediate intracellular signaling
during development?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're moving great distances,
they probably are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, since this is right before
lunch, I'll leave you with this thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they mediate transfer of sRNAs into
humans?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a very active field
looking at plant sRNAs in our serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you eat a bunch of broccoli in about
an hour, you will see broccoli sRNAs in
[SPEAKER_00]: your serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they survive your digestive system?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pretty good evidence, probably,
that it's inside vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple experiments done in mice
suggesting that it actually can influence
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression in mice, at least when you
introduce these vesicles that carry
[SPEAKER_00]: siRNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just final thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that siRNA analysis we are doing
in collaboration with Blake Myers at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Donald Danforth Center, and particularly
Patricia Baldritch has really helped out
[SPEAKER_00]: with the tiny RNA analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hans Thordahl-Christensen has been sending
us some of his mutants, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are now starting to look at EVs
in their lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some really interesting new
data suggesting that there's two distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: classes of EVs based on density,
if you do the density gradient correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard O'Connell, I showed you the
beautiful high-pressure freezing image.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's helping us out with the collotococcal
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Josh Blakeslee, I didn't get a
chance to talk about what he's doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he is a metabolomics expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has been doing some analyses to
look for glucosinolates and other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds in the EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll stop there and take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious, have you profiled the
root EVs yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, do the contents vary a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the root EVs, the only ones we've
looked at so far from soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compared the leaf soybean EVs to
the root soybean EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soybean EVs definitely differ from the
Arabidopsis EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there's no glucosinolate
transporters in soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more lipoxogenases in the
soybean EVs than we saw in the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: EVs, which could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we did not see a big difference
from root to leaf in that one data set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you thinking about looking at the
other class besides your proteins and your
[SPEAKER_03]: RNAs, i.e.
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolites in the EVs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just mentioned at the very end
that we are eagerly awaiting data from
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh, because that's his expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is particularly interested in
hormone signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's confident that they carry auxin,
so they could be involved in systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: auxin transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also going to be looking at the lipid
profiles of the EVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got hints that there are indeed
glucosinolates there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he needs to do a couple more repeats
before we can really start showing the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely very interested in
the metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a very nice talk.
Thanks.
So I have a couple of questions for the
first one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering whether the release
inside of the actual cellular vesicle is
[SPEAKER_04]: very specific in the class membrane,
because there's a nano domain or some
[SPEAKER_04]: other domain in the class membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we know about that simply is that
when we look at the proteome content of
[SPEAKER_00]: the EVs and compare it to the proteomes
that are published from other cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: compartments, the most similar proteome
that we could find in the literature was
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called detergent-resistant
microdomains, which is a controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, if you purify plasma
membranes and then treat them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: detergent and then pellet, that's what's
left over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the stuff that is resistant to
detergent, whether those represent
[SPEAKER_00]: contiguous functional domains is debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever it is that renders those
plasma membrane regions resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: detergent, those proteins are highly
similar to what we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular vesicles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really have a measurement of that
yet, because these graphs are just
[SPEAKER_00]: technically challenging to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's only looked at three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't looked at a week and two weeks
and three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's on our list of experiments to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, it's traveled a long ways by
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would guess it's probably,
you know, the seedlings are tiny when you
[SPEAKER_00]: do the graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would suspect after a day,
they've already moved across and spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just speculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, a three-part question.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, how do the EVs get out through the
plant cell wall?
[SPEAKER_02]: The second is, do you have any feeling for
what percentage of the total EVs that are
[SPEAKER_02]: available are within the tissue are
harvested through an apoplast flushing
[SPEAKER_02]: technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third is, have you considered
using, like, protoplasts with
[SPEAKER_02]: cell-operating enzymes to release more
thoroughly all of the EVs there are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have no good measurement of
what fraction of the EVs we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: through our cell wall washing procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't, like, gone back and done EM on
the vacuum infiltrator leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you could probably do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've not done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My intuition is we're probably not getting
a large percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they get through the cell wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell wall is a complex mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not uniform pore size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I suspect that they just wiggle
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence to support that, there's
actually a pretty recent paper with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal cell wall showing that they were
using some sort of marker protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just showing that this marker protein,
when it's put into essentially artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels, could easily be crossing the
fungal cell wall and getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus when nobody expected it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was something about just being in
a vesicle that allowed uptake by the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I imagine the same thing could be
happening with the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't understand the physics of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protoplast stain, we've talked about it,
but we haven't actually done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that we have done is fiddled
with the pH of the extraction buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'd standardly use, I think it's
pH 6, because we're just trying to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: gentle as possible to the apoplast and not
cause any sort of artificial things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Brian did do a pH 4 extraction once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his sense was that he got about twice
as many vesicles out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may help to loosen up the cell wall
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we have to stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can move on with the schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
