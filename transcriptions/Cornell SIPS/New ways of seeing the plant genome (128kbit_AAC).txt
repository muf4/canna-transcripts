[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Frannie said, when I met her just a
little while ago, she said she likes to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with things she can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so who wants to work with DNA,
which you can't see?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem of seeing the DNA is really
important for understanding how the genome
[SPEAKER_02]: works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to talk about data
visualization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before I start, I'd like to just,
some of you may have missed it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in the beginning of September,
there was a major scientific advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 publications were published
simultaneously in Science, Nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and other journals, which is the fruit
coming out of the ENCODE project and the
[SPEAKER_02]: latest phase of the ENCODE project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was a paradigm shifting
outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says something about the genome,
which I'd really like to communicate to
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leader of this vast consortium of
scientists, something like several,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think over 100 scientists who are part
of the consortium, over $100 million spent
[SPEAKER_02]: on this, it's basically phase three of the
genome project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you have a genome, you have to
figure out what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've been trying to understand
what the genome does.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the leader of the program
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, the genome is a jungle of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is multilayered and multidimensional.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire genomes are mostly
functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: A major, major paradigm shift in terms of
understanding of the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the bottom line is that not only
does it, we usually think of the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: code, you know, the code that goes from
DNA to RNA to protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that only accounts for one to 2% of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many other codes, many,
many codes in the genome, many languages,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ask a computer scientist if
they could write overlapping code,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would just you know, their eyes would
go crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, this is an amazing reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it suggests that understanding the
genome will be the challenge for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who raised their hand who were born
before 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that generation's challenge to
figure out what in the world is going on
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they've discovered so far,
most people acknowledge is just the tip of
[SPEAKER_02]: the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you try to even approach all
this new data?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like to tell you about what data
visualization is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an area of science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, here's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best pattern recognition software in
the universe is our brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can program a computer to look
for a pattern, but it'll only look for the
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern you asked it to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas our brain, everything we look,
our brain automatically recognizes
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, that's something that is
unique to the human brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still haven't developed a computer
that can recognize a face, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data visualization is the involves the
process of making data visual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's visual, then our brain can
take over and easily recognize patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the origin of this program
called Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you look, some of you have seen
genomic data, and it's just endless A's,
[SPEAKER_02]: T's, C's and G's, and you will find that
your brain can't really you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you look at a few million of those,
your brain doesn't see any pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do something as simple as adding
color to the scheme, you can start to see
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Skittle, the first, first dimension
of Skittle is simple colorization of
[SPEAKER_02]: nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've suggested, now for the people
in Geneva, I'm just gonna take a minute
[SPEAKER_02]: and show them some live running of the
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be happy to share it with you when
I'm back up in Geneva, maybe next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bear with me just for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna escape this and close this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to pull up Skittle program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoops, that's not the one I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is, and maybe the people in
Geneva can see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a display of approximately
40,000 pixels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each pixel represents a nucleotide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is chromosome 10 of corn,
and the first pixel is green, meaning it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a guanine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at 40,000 letters,
but because it's colorized, you can start
[SPEAKER_02]: to see patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over here, the way Skittle works is
there's basic settings at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can determine the width of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can determine the zoom in and zoom
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do, determine, go zoom to any
starting point you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ways of bringing in new data,
like from a genome browser.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are basic functions that can be
tied to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, there are different
displays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're looking at a simple
nucleotide display.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is raw data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the data as a genome,
as a fast file colorized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, let me just show you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gray are unsequenced gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just see what we can do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we can do is we can
change the diameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can perhaps see that I'm making it
narrower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I close this, if I change it
enough, you see a new pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically these are tandem repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I said, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, that's a tandem
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have a line break after the U
every time, all the letters of I love you,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you will line up and you'll get
these columns, straight up and down
[SPEAKER_02]: columns, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what you're seeing here is a
tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a large tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's throughout the, the corn genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's especially abundant in the Central
American region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, but it's throughout the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may represent five or 10% of the
genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a major element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I told you, we talked about tandem
repeats without a visualization,
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't immediately get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see a picture of it,
it's really obvious, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just, I'm going to jump back to
the PowerPoint for the sake of the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: People at Geneva, but, but perhaps that is
helpful to you.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people at Geneva, I'd be happy to just
ask me and I'll show you how the skill
[SPEAKER_02]: works later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a picture of the corn genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like it because it shows a couple of
things that are very significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is it shows the, the very different
nucleotide percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are areas that are GC rich and there
are areas that are AT rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you have areas that are
cytosine rich, they're mostly red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and so you have it's not,
you might picture it as a uniform blend,
[SPEAKER_02]: but actually there's these huge
variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, these areas that are GC rich are
where the genes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are genic regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look really carefully,
you'll see a tandem repeat here and a
[SPEAKER_02]: tandem repeat at the beginning of the end
of the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of this gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just look at that a little more
carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a similar tandem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a similar genic region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see there's a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, one is it's GC rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is that if you look really
carefully in here, you'll see a texture,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is called a, which, which we call
the three mer pattern, but that reflects
[SPEAKER_02]: codon preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you can recognize protein
coding regions okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't explained what this new display
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the repeat map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a light colored pixel here,
that means that a string this long has
[SPEAKER_02]: repeated once.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a series of pixels here,
that means you can see it correlates with
[SPEAKER_02]: this repeat here where these are lining
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a very, very sensitive map of
repeating units within the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's much more sensitive than
any other genome tool for detecting
[SPEAKER_02]: repetition within the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see here very carefully,
if you look really carefully, is there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern of dark, dark light, dark,
dark light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that pattern is throughout the genome
of all organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it represents the nature of the
protein coding the codon preferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's significant here is that
there's a tandem repeat at the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: and the end of the genic region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means that those tandem
repeats, this is something you find
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the corn genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is in thousands and thousands of places
in the corn genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means normally people have always
thought that tandem repeats are junk DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just mistakes that happen during
DNA replication.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we find is that these are
strategically at the beginning and the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of these genic regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're precisely where they're
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they always match.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of represent the beginning and
the end of the exon, the protein coding
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other interesting thing is,
it's a little bit off scale here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we can look at where the annotated
exons, recognized exons are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the things we see with Skittle
have never been described before.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, they've been invisible to
the normal gene searches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're seeing functional units
within the genome that weren't visible
[SPEAKER_02]: using other technologies for analyzing
genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an example of a similar,
similar genic region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very AT rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: You recognize it right away, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you can see the, the texture that I
spoke of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see that texture in the back?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's very distinctive of protein
coding regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see here, this is called
an exon tract.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, these lines are just marking
where there's a protein coding exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see is in this case,
this exon has been identified by previous
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers as a, a functional gene,
genic unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 99% of these structures that we see
have not been identified previously as
[SPEAKER_02]: exons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a new way of, of identifying
exons in any genome, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive and very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just more of the same, you can see a genic
region that's what I call bracketed by
[SPEAKER_02]: tandem repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tandem repeats again, are these,
are these repeating units.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a closer look at the, this texture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually see that the,
the, the greenish yellow, the guanines are
[SPEAKER_02]: lining up because this is a very
non-random.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this is the exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see that it has the exonic
signature and we can actually see the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the raw data, we can actually see that
the third nucleotide tends to always be a
[SPEAKER_02]: G.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have expressed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to the end of the line and go
back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's rastered.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this display link, this 88% thousand
nucleotides are present in this picture
[SPEAKER_02]: right here out of 3 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you'd have thousands and thousands
and thousands and thousands of pages like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, I've spent just looking at one
chromosome, you can spend hours and just
[SPEAKER_02]: get a few highlights of that chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a huge amount of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is again, what we, one of the things
we can do is we can, if we see a tandem
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat here, we know there's a tandem
repeat here because here's the repeat map.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a new display.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we click on the first nucleotide of
that line, what happens is it will take
[SPEAKER_02]: that line and search the whole genome for
that sequence and color wherever you find
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is basically just showing that
yes, this genic region is flanked by
[SPEAKER_02]: tandem repeats at both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that it's the same color
means it's the same sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can search, this is a similar one,
a different flanking sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're going to jump to grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just the reason I used corn to
begin with, is that's the only plant
[SPEAKER_02]: genome I know of where I have the exon
tract data, where people have actually
[SPEAKER_02]: figured out where the protein coding
regions are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's just consider another
horticulturally important crop and that is
[SPEAKER_02]: the grape genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here again, you can see very distinct
tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you see there are variations within
the tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question that could be asked is
that noise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like mutations, or is that actually
information?
[SPEAKER_02]: These patterns often remind me of,
again, ancient history when we had punch
[SPEAKER_02]: cards for computer analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how the repeat map very
easily detects this and also how the
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat map is telling us that right here
there is an exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data visualization is a powerful tool
when you're exploring the unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just more tandem repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are very conserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are broken up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that by design or by mutation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the repeat map finds these repeats
instantly and regardless of your frame
[SPEAKER_02]: width, you have to find, you have to bring
this red line in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the red line might have been here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it over to the, over the white,
first white line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that tells me, number one,
it tells me that this is a 66 base pair
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 66 base pairs from here to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can set the width and then
everything lines up and I can see what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a function which I didn't,
while we were live, I didn't hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: alignment cylinder display, but basically
it takes the tandem repeat and turns it
[SPEAKER_02]: into a coil and then adjusts the coil
width to all the tandem repeats are
[SPEAKER_02]: visible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually believe that tandem repeats
coil in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they form like solenoid-like
structures and that that's what these
[SPEAKER_02]: repeats are all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a striking component of,
if you zoom out, so you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole great chromosome, what you see is
this 66 base pair repeat is massively
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the center of this chromosome,
like just millions of nucleotides are just
[SPEAKER_02]: coding for this repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, this is the same repeat actually
showing the solenoid display.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see, we believe that this
is not, in nature, it can't raster.
[SPEAKER_02]: That rastering, you know, this is a nice
2D display, but this is meant to be a 3D
[SPEAKER_02]: display.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make that spin and we can,
we believe this is the actual structure in
[SPEAKER_02]: biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just keeps coiling because DNA,
it turns out, wants to align with its own
[SPEAKER_02]: similar sequence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the logical thing for a repeat is
to form a coil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is again, in grapes showing,
we don't have it, there's no published
[SPEAKER_02]: exons to my knowledge for grape,
but we would predict there's an exon here,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost certainly an exon here and possibly
exons here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue line is a strength indicator and
when it goes to purple, that means bingo,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've definitely got an exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just more evidence of exons,
a little more of the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna keep moving because,
you know, I could show you zillions of
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd mentioned that there are thousands and
thousands, these are just a few snapshots
[SPEAKER_02]: of the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the tomato genome is another
horticulturally important crop where
[SPEAKER_02]: they've completed the genome and assembled
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you see here again is there's
some strange repeats here, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: fuzzy, they're ill-defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the threemer pattern, which is a
very strong indication that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: protein coding here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these other ones are possible
exons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since exons only represent one to 2% of
the genome, it's critical to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify where they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: More potential exons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And showing some of the larger tandem
repeats that would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these really big wavy repeats that I show
you, there's a name for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called alpha satellite DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all plants and animals,
when you see the wavy pattern,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you're looking at alpha satellite
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: All hair organisms show this wavy pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, I know, I wanna go back for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that there's a region here that's
got more red and green versus the other
[SPEAKER_02]: bluer areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a GC-rich region, so it's
potentially a gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you'll see it's bracketed by a
tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same pattern we saw in corn is
showing up in tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my knowledge, this pattern has
never been seen before until I've seen it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last few months, as I've been
looking at plant genomes more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the idea of data visualization,
is it will show you patterns that a
[SPEAKER_02]: computer wouldn't have spotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we see is these things come in pairs
and they tend to bracket protein coding
[SPEAKER_02]: regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, but it gives us reason to
wanna do research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things are actually repeated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of repetition in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more of these bracketed areas,
you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an important, clue as to what's
going on in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of these have been annotated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really showing us things about the
genome we wouldn't have known without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the rice genome, this is really a
pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a picture of the centromeric alpha
DNA of rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just show it quickly because rice
like corn, the monocots have really
[SPEAKER_02]: different genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just notice the color is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's much more red and greenish yellow
and much less blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're in the dicots, everything's
bluish and everything's orangish when you
[SPEAKER_02]: go here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've zoomed in so you can see a little
more specifically the patterns that are
[SPEAKER_02]: occurring within the deviations within the
tandem repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some interesting things that
are going on here that would be worthy of
[SPEAKER_02]: exploration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here in greater detail,
it goes a dark column, a dark column,
[SPEAKER_02]: a light column, a dark column,
a dark column, a light column.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see more clearly what that
threemer display is, what it's telling us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's telling us every third nucleotide is
similar to the one that was three
[SPEAKER_02]: nucleotides before it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, the lighter the pixel,
the more the similarity averaged over the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole string.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that is a major feature
of genomes that we're seeing is the every
[SPEAKER_02]: other pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is basically black and blue
alternating sprinkled with greens and
[SPEAKER_02]: reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have no idea what that is,
but it's throughout plant and animal
[SPEAKER_02]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't doubt for a minute that it's
doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just more, evidence of exons.
[SPEAKER_02]: In rice, this pattern is very strong and
you can also see the GC rich and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: even see the alignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are lining up here partially
because of this pattern is very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means it constrains most of the
nucleotides in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us, we've been taught that most
nucleotides are just drifting and they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most nucleotides in genome have a function
and therefore need an explanation.
[SPEAKER_02]: More exons, just really, rice is really,
really strong signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's kind of a quick overview
of what plant genomes look like when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're visualized with Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittle is a program that's in
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some of these features,
the feature that measures where the exons
[SPEAKER_02]: are, the strength of that signal is just
two days old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Josiah emailed me the latest revision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all still being improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we believe we have here is a
universal genome browser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of you know what a genome
browser is, but basically if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, let's say 3 billion letters
and you're trying to figure out what it
[SPEAKER_02]: all codes for, you can't just look at the
letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've made genome browsers that
help you spot where the genes are,
[SPEAKER_02]: help you analyze where the junk or the
repeat is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other types of understanding of how
the genome is operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that Skittle is the foundation for
developing, all those browsers are one
[SPEAKER_02]: dimensional, they're strings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a two dimensional display,
two dimensional analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lets us, we believe it's the next
generation of genome browser.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when we get Skittle fully
developed, we can annotate and recognize
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every feature within the genome in a way
that's fundamentally better than genome
[SPEAKER_02]: browsers today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's already I think bearing fruit in
terms of giving us new insight into plant
[SPEAKER_02]: genomes and other genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to add just briefly some work
that my colleague Josiah Seaman did on his
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Josiah Seaman is a computer scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to digress for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was never interested in computer
science, not even a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I looked at it as a necessary evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned that I was the last one in our
department to switch from the typewriter
[SPEAKER_02]: to a computer for word processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when email came along,
I absolutely did not wanna be bothered by
[SPEAKER_02]: email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was absolutely the last person in our
department to finally connect to the
[SPEAKER_02]: email.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really funny to me that in the
last 10 years, I've played a role in
[SPEAKER_02]: developing what I think are the two most
exciting bioinformatics programs
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the reason is I had the
good sense to partner up with some really
[SPEAKER_02]: brilliant computer scientists,
because I'm still practically computer
[SPEAKER_02]: illiterate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Josiah is one of those people and he
developed all the programming that went
[SPEAKER_02]: into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that you can look at any
patterns with Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can open up any text file.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can open up Moby Dick and see what the
pattern is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also open up computer code.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way he found out he could open up
computer code was when you start Skittle,
[SPEAKER_02]: it asks you what file you wanna open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he forgot that he had already opened
Skittle, so he used Skittle to open the
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittle executable code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he immediately saw some really
surprising patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it turns out that Skittle can be used
for analyzing executable code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's machine language.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something no computer scientist,
almost no computer scientist can read
[SPEAKER_02]: machine language.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the first time we actually skip
to look at computer code.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the, that would make a really
interesting talk, but I just wanna give
[SPEAKER_02]: you some highlights from what he saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Moby Dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no pattern, no nucleotide bias.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the repeat map.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no significant amount of repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be pretty boring, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: To have the same chapter twice in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the genome for decades has been called
the book of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we assert strongly that the actual
genome has no physical similarity to a
[SPEAKER_02]: book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a book is passive, but a computer
program is active and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's what we, this is a zoomed out
version of a, one of these is executable
[SPEAKER_02]: code, zoomed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look at the whole code,
maybe 60,000 bytes of code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is a zoomed out so you
can see most of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one is code and which one is,
which one is genome?
[SPEAKER_02]: They both have these, these major shifts
in color change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in DNA, we would call the, in
chromosomes, we'd say these are isochors,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you have a change in the use of,
where the use of the nucleotides changes
[SPEAKER_02]: in a fundamental way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out that computer code does
the same thing, but we actually know what
[SPEAKER_02]: causes these shifts in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we know how computer code works,
but we don't know how genomes work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that we're seeing
similarities means we could use one to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have a change here, they're going
like from Perl to Fortran.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's computer, it's, when you change
languages, you change your letter use
[SPEAKER_02]: profile, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These, these are clearly language changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are in gene, the genome are most
likely changes to one of the many,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there are many languages in DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: The computer code is zero, zero is A,
zero, one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need two bits to get the four color
scheme.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book was, I think actually we had 26
colors.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were our shades that your eye
couldn't distinguish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so in terms of these changes in letter
use, computer code and, and he looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: other executable code, other than his own
program, we welcomed up lots of,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's pretty universal pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then he looked at, again, we're zooming
out so we're looking at a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's called the repeat map,
but on a higher scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have, for example, a long
stretch of red, which means that a short
[SPEAKER_02]: repeat less than 20 base pairs long is
repeating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's repeating for thousands and maybe
tens of thousands of letters here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this huge repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can map where all these repeats
are in a chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see they tend to be all near the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out that the computer code
is also filled with repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, here would be another
stretch of red.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also is a 10 to 20 character repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that which, which one is,
if I asked you, if I hadn't already given
[SPEAKER_02]: it away, you wouldn't know which one was a
computer code and which one was the
[SPEAKER_02]: genome, would you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we look closer at these repeats,
which of these repeats is plant repeat and
[SPEAKER_02]: which one is from computer code?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the tandem repeats in computer code are
incredibly similar to what we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazingly similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the interesting thing is for
decades, people have seen, we have known
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are these tandem repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, obviously, repeats are
junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are the repeats in computer code
junk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there, is there a single bit in a
computer code that's not functional?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it strongly suggests these tandem
repeats aren't here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reflects functionality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually know what these repeats
are for.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are data files.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a phone directory would be a data
file.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first, this would be like some
universal thing like telephone number and
[SPEAKER_02]: then people have different numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data files in computer code give you
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps these are data files.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these, another element of plant genome
is that they're called what are dispersed
[SPEAKER_02]: repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can have repeats where
they're head to toe, or you can have the
[SPEAKER_02]: same repeating element all throughout the
genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these, these would be called,
these would be plant, this would be like a
[SPEAKER_02]: transposable element.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these would be words that are common
within the computer language.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually, you know,
write in any sequence you want and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: look through, through the script and find
wherever it occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find out how abundant certain
words are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So word structure use or transposable
elements are very similar within code and
[SPEAKER_02]: within genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bottom line is what he's seen is
that genomes and executable code have
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing similarities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use linear strings of code.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use multiple languages.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use parallel processing,
which means, you know, you can have lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of genes reading at the same time,
like lots of processors in your computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both have a strong character bias
where the total color shift occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use extensive use of recurrent
tandem repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use commonly dispersed repeats
or words.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both use large scale localization of
the repeats near the ends of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they both have passive and active
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: A book just sits there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: A program runs and it's self-changing,
self-modifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of this is consistent with a trend
within genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more, genomicists are saying the
genome is executable code.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really a better understanding
than the idea that it's an instruction
[SPEAKER_02]: manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just really exciting to see
that Skittle strongly supports that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes from a simile or an analogy to
actually something we can measure,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can actually measure the features
that are in common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd just like to conclude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there are deep hidden,
there's deep hidden beauty in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've gazed at these colorful
pictures for hundreds of hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genome has many levels of structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've only detected a small fraction of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nucleotide bias is very strong,
which is interesting because blue-black
[SPEAKER_02]: areas want to mutate to red-green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And red-green areas want to mutate to
blue-black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very hard to imagine how to create
or sustain those biases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tandem repeats, it's clear because they
bracket the genes, can carry information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not necessarily junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tandem repeats would logically form into
large coils, which might have function.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see ubiquitous tumor and threemur
patterns, which the threemur seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: reflect codon bias, protein coding bias.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are many levels of order
still waiting to be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And higher genomes are most like computer
code.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line of what we've been
learning the last few years using Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good place to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the one connection I would suggest
is that there's communication at every
[SPEAKER_02]: level, from the molecules to the cells to
the tissues to communication between
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, there's the brain
function, which is all kinds of levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: communication there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So information is at the heart of 21st
century biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all really about information science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything is integrated at a level
that blows our mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very hard to conceive of how
that integration could have ever arisen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a really interesting
question that I think more and more people
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna be asking us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biology is much more fantastic than we
ever imagined.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a real, it makes it
exciting to be a biologist in the 21st
[SPEAKER_02]: century, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically for data visualization,
you have to be creative in presenting the
[SPEAKER_02]: data in new ways to the human brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The human brain works by methods we have
no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we do see a pattern, like I'm
seeing this pattern where I have what
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like a large coding region that has
not previously been identified as a exon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see it's bracketed by tandem
repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that's a highly ordered
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Josiah points out is he says,
Skittle is for discovering the pattern,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then you have to write special
computer code to analyze the pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can go back and ask the computer
to find every instance on that chromosome
[SPEAKER_02]: where that pattern happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the next step for that
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's available, free of charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download it anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to understand how to use
it, but it will continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being updated almost weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually Josiah's just introduced a
feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're online and you're using
Skittle and he updates it, there a little
[SPEAKER_02]: thing will come up on Skittle that says
update now and you'll get the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: version.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he realizes that it's gonna be under
wraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rapid and continuous improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't have, there's nothing like
Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one has a program like Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would take notice of Skittle,
but they haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as we, actually this corn pattern
that I described, when we show that we use
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittle to discover that, which is I think
a major feature of the corn genome,
[SPEAKER_02]: then people will say, oh, I guess maybe I
should look into this Skittle business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is a powerful tool to just see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also for teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were teaching genome to students
and you just show them A's, T's,
[SPEAKER_02]: C's, and G's, it doesn't sink in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with Skittle, actually, you can start
to see, oh, I see what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I start to see the different types of
organization within the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's both a research tool and a
great teaching tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we basically upload any FASTA file
and it basically, the first thing it does
[SPEAKER_02]: is just colorize the letters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as that happens, you start to
see patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it allows us to change the width or
zoom in and out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows us to put up the repeat map
or the cylinder display or several other
[SPEAKER_02]: display options.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the raw data is that colorful screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually looking at the genome
when you look at that, just like you are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at a FASTA file.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a lot more interesting than a
FASTA file.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the repeat map takes the first line,
whatever the width is, it reads the first
[SPEAKER_02]: line and then compares that to the one
nucleotide over the line that represents
[SPEAKER_02]: the next nucleotide over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it compares that first line with
every other possible alignment in the
[SPEAKER_02]: view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for every alignment, it gives a
score for the similarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And decides how bright the pixel should be
for that spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it forms a massive calculation each
time you move the screen to recognize all
[SPEAKER_02]: the possible similarities between the
first string and all the other parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: that display.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the display pattern, the repeat map,
which is the black and the gray scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually doesn't change as you change
width.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is just measuring the repeats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll see those repeats regardless of
the display.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cylinder display finds the
best alignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the regular display, you have to
manually adjust the width to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: nice visual patterns of the tandem
repeats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's possibly a pattern in width.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 66 mer that I found in tomato was
also in corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you find a repeat, you'll find
that it's a family of repeats throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: that chromosome and all the chromosomes of
that species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few repeats are novel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like words.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're found in many different places
in the genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, as we discover these new
layers of information, we would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: have it like, you know how old fashioned
overhead transparencies?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put several on top and you could
see how they all line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to have Skittle have transparent
pages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could adjust the transparency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see where the exons are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see where the transcriptional
factor binding sites are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see where the histone binding sites
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see where the folding motifs are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's layer upon layer of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way is to have a layered
display.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the next.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
