[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm picking up a little flash flash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, there'll be insight that goes
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's this light.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to share with you some of the
work that we've been doing here at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell, focusing on reducing tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a collaboration that goes across
several universities and sort of regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a partner in Michigan,
where you have some faculty there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan Brainerd and Sophia Zendri,
who are on our project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the experiments that we're
doing here in New York are repeated there,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as Mark Hutton, who's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's another collaborator up in Maine,
along with Eric Gallant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this workout, what I want to share
with you, is focused in on trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: integrate cover crops into strip tilled
systems, and so a reduced tillage system
[SPEAKER_03]: in our organic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been working with organic
vegetables in trying to adapt reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage systems to them for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And started our work primarily in
conventionally managed vegetables,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of that was funded with SARE.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we're trying to sort of see how
can we adapt and integrate these systems
[SPEAKER_03]: for organic vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without the tools that our
conventional growers have with herbicides,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of our most important concerns and
considerations is how do we design these
[SPEAKER_03]: with cover crops so we can actually be
managing weeds well in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I talk about reducing tillage,
we're focusing on, and we use reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing a straight no-till here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at trying to decrease the
intensity, the frequency and depth of
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage, or soil disturbance over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some systems that people work
on that are looking at rotational tillage,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're applying tillage at certain
parts of your rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our case, we primarily are focusing on
strip tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use an unberfer type, a deep zone
tiller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a tool that creates a narrow
and a restricted area of soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have on this, if you've not seen one
of these before, the implement itself has
[SPEAKER_03]: a cutting culture to cut through residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a shank that you set to operate
below a compacted layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the goal is to fracture the
compacted layer, compacted soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have a cup of this here that
actually helps break up and create a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little mound of soil that would be right
in the area where you're planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to create all of your
tillage and soil disturbance within a
[SPEAKER_03]: narrow band of soil that is prepared for
planting, direct seeding or transplanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we opted for this in our area,
which is more of the Northern tier,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we wanted to make sure with
vegetables that we could protect the early
[SPEAKER_03]: season establishment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having soils warm quickly and having
the crop get to a good start, so we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing a delay in the actual crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of vegetable crops aren't always as
vigorous and hardy as some of the field
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so trying to optimize those conditions
early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and the other thing about the strip
tillage is that because it is a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: compromise where it's not a straight no
till, we do have some different advantages
[SPEAKER_03]: to the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're restricting the tillage to that in
row area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so soils are warming there more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get increased mineralization rates
because we do have disturbance there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're adding air, oxygen and
disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a better seed bed for,
like I said, for seeding into.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, we can incorporate
fertilizers if they're actually in that
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in some of our work with conventional
growers, we're able to actually apply
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer behind the shank deep into the
soil so it's available to the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're dealing with compaction in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also allows us to sort of keep this
undisturbed area between there where if we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a cover crop, we can retain a mulch
on the surface of the soil, which can help
[SPEAKER_03]: us actually conserve some soil moisture
and ideally protect from erosion,
[SPEAKER_03]: protect from water movement across the
field very quickly, as well as creating
[SPEAKER_03]: this habitat for beneficials or pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen some of both and generally
contributing to soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's some of the advantages,
but it does have its disadvantages as well
[SPEAKER_03]: because certainly when we're trying to
manage that residue and we're restricting
[SPEAKER_03]: the width of our tillage, we can still
deal with problems with residue
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulating in that area, making it
difficult to create the kind of seed bed
[SPEAKER_03]: we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is one of our big challenges
with cover crop integration into a strip
[SPEAKER_03]: till is cover crops can still end up
either being pinned or the root balls of
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves will create interference
despite the activity of that tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a result, you can have some
problems with stand for seed soil contact
[SPEAKER_03]: if you still don't have an optimized soil
condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: For getting a good germination of some of
our more dense, more tender crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they can be maybe 12 inches wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tricky to cultivate in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've been trying different tools,
but how you actually cultivate or manage
[SPEAKER_03]: using equipment based approaches in that
narrow zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then between the row dealing with the
residue, particularly if we have a really
[SPEAKER_03]: wet year and you have that mulch in place,
you still have to cultivate through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the tools that you have in
hand?
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to pull that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in some cases, because we're not
actually disturbing the soils there and in
[SPEAKER_03]: organic system would that would also
contribute to not having as much nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: that's actually being mineralized for the
whole system for the roots, the crop to
[SPEAKER_03]: have available to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some challenges with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the what we've been trying
to explore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially with organic system,
we want to be able to reduce tillage as
[SPEAKER_03]: part of that sort of overall soil health
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to really advance it,
we can do this on a bare ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can do zone building with bare soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, we can create conditions fairly
easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as we add cover crops,
we add complication.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know that when you stack these
approaches, we have a more improved
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit to soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what our goal is to sort of
figure how do we integrate these for
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the basics around managing
cover crops for reduced tillage that are
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of true in managing cover crops in
general that we're trying to see at the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate time to have a good biomass
that's going to provide some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits of cover crops in and
traditionally a lot of season people who
[SPEAKER_03]: use own till say kill early kill
effectively to try to manage the residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in our case with organic, we're trying
to figure out how we have to wait for that
[SPEAKER_03]: killing step in order to actually
terminate the cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we how do we deal with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: In our case, we have chosen to do our work
with flail mowing, we're not rolling in
[SPEAKER_03]: these systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a distinction I wanted to
make for sure is that in a rolled system
[SPEAKER_03]: where you have much more cover and you're
creating that solid mat, that tool
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in a no till system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in our case, in the more upper part of
the northeast, our soils are cooled are
[SPEAKER_03]: much cooler under that system and other
experiments in the past haven't worked as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it with later planted crops
like squashes and sometimes with larger
[SPEAKER_03]: seeded crops like sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to delay your plan to make it
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we chose to work with the strip
till system that it's a compromise between
[SPEAKER_03]: full width tillage and then no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the challenges again is sort
of to be able to have that soil prepared
[SPEAKER_03]: and and the conditions correct for
actually being able to plant into it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then manage the crop to optimize that
yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we in our experiments, we set this up
to look at in in the past, we've looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: both winter creel cover crops using like
oat pea combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the nice thing about using those in a
reduced till system is that they're out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the way, you don't have to deal with them
in the following year, they're the
[SPEAKER_03]: residues don't interfere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But trying to really optimize these
systems for the winter hardy type covers,
[SPEAKER_03]: the rye like a cereal rye and a veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we have to think carefully
about our planning and our management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we set about to look at
alternate management systems for cover
[SPEAKER_03]: crops in in this particular trial where
we're integrating cover crops with strip
[SPEAKER_03]: till is think about the ways that we're
terminating the cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had three treatments that we use
for termination.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used the traditional sort of flail and
drop the mulch leave the cover crop in
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're calling that a mulch
treatment because it's basically setting
[SPEAKER_03]: on the surface of the soil it's left in
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another system is what we call a cut and
carry in which the covers are flail
[SPEAKER_03]: chopped and then removed with a wagon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're flail chopped into wagon and
the residue is completely removed from the
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the roots are still intact,
but the surf the above ground biomass is
[SPEAKER_03]: gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't interfere then with
practices that happen later in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the third is sort of the control
where we would mow the cover crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then incorporate it with rototilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the again, the residue is out of
the way, but it's incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_03]: surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully not interfering with any of
the other practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at it with basically three
kinds of cover crop mixes.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, it was we use the winter rye
and hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also use a winter rye and a crimson
clover and then a straight hairy vetch
[SPEAKER_03]: planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for each of those mixes,
we use these different combinations of
[SPEAKER_03]: termination strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to then going in and doing strip
tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the way that we're trying to
see how we can bring them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: In these experiments, we also had a side
dress nitrogen application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause in our previous work in organic
reduced hill, nitrogen does appear
[SPEAKER_03]: limiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we wanted to see how and if the
supplementary side dress event would
[SPEAKER_03]: actually address a limitation that wasn't
at all due to the tillage system
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are, working with a uniformly
seeded type of a mix where you're mixing
[SPEAKER_03]: the rye and the vetch, for example,
and putting it across the field as a mix,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's drilled, you have a mix is
one strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also wanted to look at what would
happen if you segregated your cover crops
[SPEAKER_03]: into strips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so planting, putting your legume cover
crop in the row where you intend to plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and keep the cereal rye or the grain cover
in between the rows, you maintain a
[SPEAKER_03]: residue there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying to optimize the spatial
distribution of the cover crop and also
[SPEAKER_03]: then facilitate possibly the use of the
strip tiller in order to create the kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of zones that we wanted for planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, it's generally here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have this mix and when you have this
legume, a legume and your cereal mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: together, your nitrogen is also
distributed from the legume across the
[SPEAKER_03]: field, but by creating and segregating it
where we're putting all of the legume
[SPEAKER_03]: right in the zone where we would strip
till and plant the crop, we try to
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate the nitrogen that's fixed by
that legume into the area where the crop
[SPEAKER_03]: will be grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just felt that not only do we get
the benefit in this system of actually
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrating the nitrogen, those legumes
are easier to manage and the residue
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't be as problematic in a strip till
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was two benefits that could be
explored.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to look at the strip planted,
we use the same cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had winter rye between the row and
hairy vetch in the row, crimson clover in
[SPEAKER_03]: the row or none.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we maintained the cereal,
the winter rye in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, in all of these cases,
basically they were planted in the fall
[SPEAKER_03]: and then flail mode and dropped in place
and then strip, the zone builder was used
[SPEAKER_03]: in a crop across the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, the zones are built
right over where the legume was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we sort of, we created that sort of
plan tracking when we seeded these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, there's the mixes for all of
these mixes, we had these three kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: termination, but then in the case of the
strip planted, we only, we just flailed
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we strip a zone built and then
looked at how a cabbage crop would
[SPEAKER_03]: perform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in all of these, we use the cabbage
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an overview of the basic timeline was
drilling the cover crops in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the spring, mowing the cover
crop and then a couple of weeks later,
[SPEAKER_03]: zone building and planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cover crops had some time to
actually dry down before we did the zone
[SPEAKER_03]: building and the planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are just a few pictures of the
mulch system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the mix of the rye and the
hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is typical, what you typically see
when you're actually planting these in the
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rate on the rye was 60 pounds per acre
and then the vetch was at a 20 pound per
[SPEAKER_03]: acre rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is what it looked like for
strip planting with nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the rye between the rows and
then nothing planted in the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so where we would zone build is right
in this area here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the zone, once this has been flailed,
the zone builder would be run right
[SPEAKER_03]: through this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here's a picture where we have
the hairy vetch that's planted in the area
[SPEAKER_03]: that we would be zone building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the crimson clover to give you an
idea of how it looked like prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: termination.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so first thing I wanted to share is
the overall biomass of the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to give you a sense of how these
grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this experiment and its design was
replicated also in Michigan with Dan
[SPEAKER_03]: Brainerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was doing his experiment on a
sandy loam soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is information from 2016,
a dry year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were really challenged there
because of irrigation and the lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see that their biomass was
much lower in their experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look across what we had at
our trial that was in here in the Ithaca
[SPEAKER_03]: area in Freeville at our organic research
farm, the cereal rye was the bulk of the
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, where we had just a vetch
crop, a fairly low biomass, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: this was just vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had an oat nurse crop that went out
with it, but it was just primarily vetch
[SPEAKER_03]: in the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it was strip planted or if the
vetch and the rye were mixed and sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: planted uniformly across the field,
about the same amount of biomass was
[SPEAKER_03]: generated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't a big difference in the
amount of biomass within a combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we looked at the amount of total
nitrogen that was in the above ground
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass, this is again to give you a sense
of the contribution of the legume as well
[SPEAKER_03]: as the rye to the subsequent crop because
it did play out in the performance of the
[SPEAKER_03]: crops afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the straight vetch had the
highest total amount of N in the above
[SPEAKER_03]: ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So despite having a fairly low total dry
biomass above ground, it still had more
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen that was contributed to the
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is an important point that'll be
carried out later on with the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the strip planted as well as the
mixed crops, we had about half as much of
[SPEAKER_03]: the nitrogen that was contributed by the
legumes and also some that was in the rye
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this just gives you a sense of the
total amount of nitrogen that was in this
[SPEAKER_03]: above ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the cover crops, that doesn't say
anything about what was happening below
[SPEAKER_03]: ground, but just as an estimate of above
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, once we flail mowed
everything we went through and we zone
[SPEAKER_03]: built, one of the challenges in trying to
do zone building, especially with
[SPEAKER_03]: something like rye, is the heavy amount of
residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having the right, doing some work
with, make sure you have row cleaners in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of your implements is really
important, especially in front of the
[SPEAKER_03]: planter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a picture from Michigan where
they had it integrated into their strip
[SPEAKER_03]: till unit where they could do everything
in one pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to sometimes use a separate pass in
the first year, but having that row
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaner in front really was important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we might've strip planted it,
we still had to move the residue out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you flail, it still gets in the way
and it can still create not, it can impact
[SPEAKER_03]: how well that strip tiller works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is just a picture of how it looks
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have these bands that are disturbed
and ready for planting after we've
[SPEAKER_03]: actually gone through with the strip,
the zone builder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so depending on the mix of the cover
crop, the residue lasted different amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: of time over the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we definitely, in the case of the
rye vetch, sort of at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_03]: season, you can see a lot of that rye
vetch present and it lasted quite a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: later.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was in a dry year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it did actually have some residual
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the past, we found about three
weeks is the best we get as far as weed
[SPEAKER_03]: suppression from a cover that's in the row
after it's been mowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even in the vetch, it did actually
have some residual vetch, but not very
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to doing a weed management
passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this year, Brian Caldwell,
who's here, he does all of our equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: work, which we're really grateful for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have had a hillside rolling cultivator
at the farm and we use it in this strip
[SPEAKER_03]: till system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it did a really good job of being able
to deal with between row weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can see here in the zone,
you can see where the zone is,
[SPEAKER_03]: where this cabbage is, but then in between
that rolling cultivator actually moved
[SPEAKER_03]: through and managed to actually do a
really nice job of cleaning up in between
[SPEAKER_03]: the rows in spite of the remaining residue
that was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, in trying to put together the
system, it's important to, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of think through these pieces of it
because it's not just about adapting one
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the system in order to make it
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the right row cleaners on
planters, as well as on the zone tiller,
[SPEAKER_03]: having planned ahead for the weed
management strategy, because dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: residue makes everything more complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a picture of the hillside
that has these gangs of, these have this
[SPEAKER_03]: on them and you can adjust it with
hydraulics, fairly small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do everything on two rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see all these pictures from agronomic
crops that are much wider.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we stay very humble within our little
two row system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to share here a little
bit about the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had shared, I told you earlier that
in the case of the vetch, a fairly high
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of nitrogen was in the above ground
biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we rototilled that, so these are
the three tillage systems, the rototilled
[SPEAKER_03]: being the first bar, then the cut and
carry where we actually flailed and
[SPEAKER_03]: chopped and removed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then versus, the mulch system was
actually the traditional flail,
[SPEAKER_03]: drop it and then strip till it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that residues on the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: That when, in the case of just post
planting, looking at soil nitrogen levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: that when we had rototilled the vetch in,
there was a real, definitely a burst of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen that was mineralized and made
available to the crop right at planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that even carried through at the time
of side dress, which is a few weeks later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still had the impact of that
practice and that management strategy with
[SPEAKER_03]: the hairy vetch only in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other cover crops, fairly low
levels of soluble nitrogen measured in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soils in the planting zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when, and we looked at the cabbage
biomass and the response in the cabbage
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of reflected that same amount of
nitrogen that was available where in the
[SPEAKER_03]: case of the vetch with the high end
contribution we saw again, a rototilled,
[SPEAKER_03]: a higher amount, a larger plant,
a higher growth rate, but that didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually carry through all the way to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it came to harvest and then we came
to our yields, they all caught up at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end as far as with the hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is two years of data from this
experiment of 2016 and 2017, hot off the
[SPEAKER_03]: press.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, here's the first year and the second
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing I would just suggest
is that the patterns are really similar
[SPEAKER_03]: over both years.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we observed with these cover crop
combinations and these management
[SPEAKER_03]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the first bar would represent
the management rototill versus the cut and
[SPEAKER_03]: carry and the mulch systems where we're
just dropping it and leaving it like a
[SPEAKER_03]: mulch on the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the, and then in this case we
had the three different cover crops that
[SPEAKER_03]: we compared, the mixed rye and hairy
vetch, mixed rye and crimson clover and
[SPEAKER_03]: the straight vetch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when no nitrogen is applied,
basically these were not side dressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was a part of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do any side dressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vetch definitely stood out as
supporting the best yield compared to the
[SPEAKER_03]: rye vetch mix and the rye crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at, in the case of just the
vetch the management system for that cover
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had similar yields, whether we
rototilled it in cover, removed the above
[SPEAKER_03]: ground biomass or we left it on the
surface of the mulch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is like the really traditional
strip till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in, whether it was the vetch,
the rye and crimson clover here again,
[SPEAKER_03]: no significant difference between a
traditional rototilled approach to dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with that cover or a strip till.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is good news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and it was same in both years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we compare the cover crop
combination for rototilled, basically the
[SPEAKER_03]: vetch was performing better than the
other, the combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rye crimson clover was definitely poor
performing in these systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of our challenges with that is
sort of an artifact of the experimental
[SPEAKER_03]: design that we had to deploy everything on
the same day.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had optimized the time of kill,
we probably would have had better
[SPEAKER_03]: performance than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we looked at the strip
planted versus the mixed covers,
[SPEAKER_03]: in this case, again, here we have the
vetch, which is just a straight vetch
[SPEAKER_03]: planted across the field, but it's
included as a nice comparison for a high
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the other extreme,
we have a rye with nothing, no legume.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see here that the light blue
bars are with no nitrogen applied as an
[SPEAKER_03]: additional side dress, and then with a
side dress nitrogen applied across all of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cover crop mixes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what becomes really apparent is
whether we strip planted or mixed planted
[SPEAKER_03]: the cover crops, that the responses were
sort of, were pretty much similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the use of that strip planted cover,
while it might've provided some benefits
[SPEAKER_03]: to us as far as being able to do the zone
building and actually implement the
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy, didn't result in much of a
difference in the yield compared to if we
[SPEAKER_03]: were just mixing covers in a traditional
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a bummer because we were
really thinking we were on the track,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's what we have learned here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other thing to note is that
we've always been concerned with organic
[SPEAKER_03]: when we're restricting the width of
tillage through something like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're not gonna get all that nitrogen
mineralized through the disturbance of
[SPEAKER_03]: soil that would be really important for
many of our vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we did side dress, we generally
got a slight improvement in, we got an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement in the yield, but it wasn't
always significantly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for all of these mixes and for veg,
adding the supplemental side dress didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really improve the performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those particular treatments where
we were really seeing a low nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, we did see an improvement in the
yields in those cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is year one and year two,
very similar results.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Michigan, where they had much drier
conditions, a similar pattern,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't have the veg treatment like we
did, but again, seeing the same,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they, in their case, because they had
such poor growth in their cover crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't have a lot of nitrogen because
it was very dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really where they had nitrogen added
that they were actually able to support
[SPEAKER_03]: yield and get enough yields from the
cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the interaction of nitrogen
supplementation, depending on conditions
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes really important to make these
systems work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just in summary for where we're at with
this work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is part of a four-year
project, and this is two years focused on
[SPEAKER_03]: strip till and cover crops that our
cabbage in a reduced till system,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the strip till did as well as if we had
rototilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't see, we had similar yield in
the strip tilled and the rototilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes with the cut and carry system,
when we were removing all that above
[SPEAKER_03]: ground biomass, we did see a slight
depression in the performance of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cabbage and the yield loss, which makes
some sense if that's actually contributing
[SPEAKER_03]: to the nitrogen for the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I didn't show all of the
combinations where we added nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it generally improved the performance
of the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think certainly in some years
with more rainfall, where there could be
[SPEAKER_03]: other stresses, it's a logical thing to be
including a side dress application,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we didn't always see a yield benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bench only cover crop really did
optimize the cabbage performance,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is interesting because it doesn't
create as much residue that you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we haven't looked at other sort of
benefits to soil health, and we didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: look at carbon or any of the other
indicators that might suggest that to
[SPEAKER_03]: balance what are the outcomes of using
this cover crop combination with reduced
[SPEAKER_03]: till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the strip till planted covers
helped, but they didn't actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't that much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we thought it would help us really
make the system work, it wasn't that big
[SPEAKER_03]: of an improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it certainly didn't, it facilitated
reduced tillage, but we didn't see a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference in yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of where we're at with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just wanting to highlight again,
the partnerships and the research that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on here across these different
institutions.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to call out Ryan Marr,
who works in the program, and Brian
[SPEAKER_03]: Caldwell as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are really the energy that makes this
whole thing roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we take a few questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have extra time at the very end,
so we can go over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think that you've soiled
all the cover crops before?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we flailed at amthesis,
so I think it would probably have been
[SPEAKER_03]: rolled at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is primarily the cold soils,
and then the rolling restricts our ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to do any kind of rescue with cultivation
later in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the primary ones of why we
didn't roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have a roller crimper.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have, I have a rolling stock
chopper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've tried this in the past and
worked with Steve Groff back in the 2000s,
[SPEAKER_03]: where we would actually roll covers using
different ways of chopping and rolling and
[SPEAKER_03]: crimping.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in an organic system where it's even
more, I think, restricted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the soil temperature makes more,
it's more important to me at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you plan to cover crop changes,
or how would you recommend those?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done it one way, I think in using a
drill and blocking holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, no, I don't, tell me, how was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cabbage is about 30 inch facing,
and our grain drill has seven and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: inch in the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's four rows, or corresponding to
each drill cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has, our drill has a large seed box
and a small seed box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could just block two rows to the
seed holes for the large seed and put the
[SPEAKER_01]: large seed through in between the rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the small seed, we would
block, we would tape off just the other
[SPEAKER_01]: two and have the legume seed fall through
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way is a little hand seeding with
a seeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the crimson clover, we could do it with
one pass, but the best we could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other, like a seeder that I've
used in the past that we could actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: depends on where the auger is in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if the auger is below the seed box,
then we were able to actually block fully
[SPEAKER_03]: and we could mix the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we did, when we were doing hairy
vetch in a strip and rye in a strip,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had to mix oats with it to slow down
the flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we created, that's how we created,
we were able to regulate the rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could get the rate of vetch that we
wanted is by using oats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting at a really good thing
in that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this experiment, we aren't in the
same field in both years, but in the past,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I've done experiments looking with
zone building in the same field,
[SPEAKER_03]: we go 15 inches, we offset each year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll strip, we'll zone tail in one
area the first year, then we'll move to
[SPEAKER_03]: the middle the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then experienced growers over time who
are able to keep with the system,
[SPEAKER_03]: are able to actually bring the shanks up
so they're not disturbing as deeply over
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're moving from the deep zone till
to more of a shallow strip till system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a way in which a field or soils
will adapt over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

Thank you.
