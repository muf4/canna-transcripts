[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Elizabeth Semeyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as was mentioned, today I'm going to
be talking to you about my honors thesis
[SPEAKER_07]: project that I'll be finishing up this
fall on the characterization of green
[SPEAKER_07]: morphology loci in wheat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to start off, I'd like you guys to take
a look at the pictures on the right side
[SPEAKER_07]: of the screen and see if you can tell
which ones are wider.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very hard to tell, but the ones
on the bottom are actually 0.1 millimeters
[SPEAKER_07]: wider than the ones on the top.
[SPEAKER_07]: And although that seems like a very
minuscule difference in a cereal crop like
[SPEAKER_07]: wheat, on the large scale that can lead to
significant increases in yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the main components of yield are,
let's see there, spikes per area,
[SPEAKER_07]: kernels per spike, and kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And understanding the genetic
contributions to each of those is
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial because it can help us bring
about yield increases by effectively
[SPEAKER_07]: combining positive alleles for each of
those components.
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically, our research is examining
kernel width, length, and weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been found that increasing weight
and uniformity in kernels can improve
[SPEAKER_07]: milling quality and flower yield,
and as I mentioned, also increase yield
[SPEAKER_07]: potential.
[SPEAKER_07]: So based on a previous study with the
W7984 by OPATA, double papilloid reference
[SPEAKER_07]: population, they identified several QTL
for kernel morphology traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is just a reference population
that's used for mapping different traits
[SPEAKER_07]: in wheat.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the objective of the overall granting
program that my research falls under is to
[SPEAKER_07]: identify and deploy beneficial alleles for
genes affecting grain yield components.
[SPEAKER_07]: So specifically for my project,
kernel morphology, leading to more
[SPEAKER_07]: productive varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the strategy to do that, we're
phenotyping kernel size and shape,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then mapping and validating two
previously identified QTL on chromosomes
[SPEAKER_07]: 2D and 5A, using the synopt DH population,
genotyping recombinant inbred lines,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then developing heterogeneous inbred
families so that we can find map within
[SPEAKER_07]: those identified QTL.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to give you guys a little bit of an
idea of the different populations,
[SPEAKER_07]: the DH population that we're working in is
developed by inducing chromosome doubling
[SPEAKER_07]: from F1.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have one generation over
combination, limited resolution,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you can get some idea mapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the real population, which is
over 2,000 individuals created by single
[SPEAKER_07]: seed descent and selfing to the F6.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from those, we can do fine
mapping by identifying heterozygous lines
[SPEAKER_07]: using flanking markers for our QTL.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can self those and select for
recombination, or use the individual for
[SPEAKER_07]: recombination for fine mapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the original plant material that we
used was a synopt DH reference population,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that was field grown in randomized
head rows in 2016, 17, and 18.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we phenotyped for 1,000 kernel weight
width and length.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did that using, we take about 100
kernels from each sample on a flatbed
[SPEAKER_07]: scanner.
[SPEAKER_07]: That scanner has software that can measure
the width and length of each individual
[SPEAKER_07]: kernel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also measure the weight of
that sample and use that to calculate
[SPEAKER_07]: 1,000 kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each of those phenotypes, we combine
with a mixed model to generate block
[SPEAKER_07]: values, which are best linear unbiased
predictors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that allows us to create one phenotype
value for each line that we have to
[SPEAKER_07]: compare across environments and reps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So based on that information, we used our
QTL to associate the phenotypes with the
[SPEAKER_07]: genotypes that we have for the lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we validated the 2D QTL, which is 4.4
centimergens, or about 12 megabase pairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was significant for 1,000 kernel
weight and length.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also identified 150 DH lines that
had a uniform allele type across that QTL
[SPEAKER_07]: region that we were able to use to
evaluate the percent variation explained
[SPEAKER_07]: by the QTL for the different traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Similarly, for the 5A QTL, we validated
that QTL, and it was significant for 1,000
[SPEAKER_07]: kernel weight and kernel width.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one is a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only 4.8 centimergens, but it's
actually 110 megabase pairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can see, there's several markers
and the log scores that show the
[SPEAKER_07]: significance for the 1,000 kernel weight
and kernel width within that region.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, there are 150 lines that
allowed us to evaluate percent variation
[SPEAKER_07]: explained for the different traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see here, for kernel
weight, both of the QTL provide increases
[SPEAKER_07]: in 1,000 kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the parent that provides the
increase is different.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the 2D allele, the increase comes
from the W7984 parent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for the 5A allele, it comes from
the OPATA parent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each of those explains about 11% of
the variation in 1,000 kernel weight for
[SPEAKER_07]: both of those separate alleles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see here, for kernel
length, the kernel length is significant.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a significant increase in kernel
lengths for the 2D allele, and that
[SPEAKER_07]: explains about 20% of the variation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there is not a significant
increase in the 5A allele for kernel
[SPEAKER_07]: length.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that goes to show you that 1,000 kernel
weight and many components make it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the 2D allele, the kernel length
is what's driving that increase.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the other side of the spectrum
for kernel width, you can see that the 5A
[SPEAKER_07]: allele is providing the increase in 1,000
kernel weight through width.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that actually provides or explains
about 35% of the variation in kernel
[SPEAKER_07]: width, where the 2D allele does not
provide a significant increase.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to quickly summarize that part,
we evaluated kernel width, length,
[SPEAKER_07]: and width.
[SPEAKER_07]: For kernel weight, we mapped and validated
the two QTL on chromosomes 5A and 2D.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one on 2D was significant for kernel
length and kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one on 5A was significant for
kernel width and kernel weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, this semester, we've been
developing additional markers within our
[SPEAKER_07]: region that we were able to genotype the
different lines and more effectively find
[SPEAKER_07]: that within our regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I mentioned, there's a lack of
resolution in the DHs because there's only
[SPEAKER_07]: one generation of recombination.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to go on with fine mapping,
we need a little bit more recombination.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where the recombinant and bred
line populations come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can see here, we have markers at
17 megabase pairs and 27 megabase pairs
[SPEAKER_07]: for the 2D allele.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are able to evaluate the real
population, all the different lines,
[SPEAKER_07]: to see which ones are heterozygous or
potentially have recombinations within our
[SPEAKER_07]: region so that we can go further and find
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they have recombination,
we can use those lines to find map
[SPEAKER_07]: already.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if they're heterozygous,
we can help those until they have
[SPEAKER_07]: recombination within that region so that
we can further find out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, it's very important that we
develop more markers within that region so
[SPEAKER_07]: that we can pinpoint exactly where those
recombination events are because right now
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't really know and that we can't
find maps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once we develop those markers,
we'll be able to pinpoint exactly where
[SPEAKER_07]: those recombination events are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So currently, we have some HIFs for the 2D
allele growing in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're planning on harvesting and
planting progeny, phenotyping those,
[SPEAKER_07]: developing or genotyping the existing cask
markers that we have, and then developing
[SPEAKER_07]: new cask markers in the regions so that we
can go further and find map within those.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, we've begun introgression of
the QTL into elite varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can do that because although we
have pretty wide QTL right now,
[SPEAKER_07]: over a generation of genes, we can narrow
that as we further find map.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the main goals in our lab for
this project is to do gene cloning so that
[SPEAKER_07]: we can more effectively introduce these
genes for these kernel morphology traits
[SPEAKER_07]: into elite varieties and more effectively
bring about yield increases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that, I'd like to thank the Soros
lab, especially Professor Mark Soros,
[SPEAKER_07]: my advisor, my PhD student mentor,
Ellie Tagen, and the rest of the Soros
[SPEAKER_07]: lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: The funding sources, the wheat cow
project, USDA NIFA, and the Cornell small
[SPEAKER_07]: grains breeding and genetics program for
providing the plant material.
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, my literature is cited.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any idea like what genes might be
controlling kernel size?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you had narrowed down to a genetic
region, is it known yet what genes you
[SPEAKER_07]: might be looking for?
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question was, is it known what
types of genes we might be looking for?
[SPEAKER_07]: That would influence these traits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't believe that there are any,
specifically there are ones that are
[SPEAKER_07]: looked at for like cell length or width,
specifically like within the kernel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So actually we'll also be looking at
further into the fall of some of the,
[SPEAKER_07]: more specifically those areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, questions?
Good.
Great.
All
[SPEAKER_07]: right, so hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: As they said, I'm Simone Landau and I'm a
double major in plant science and culture
[SPEAKER_06]: and biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be talking about a summer
internship I did in a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to give you a quick overview to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I'm going to talk about the
location where I was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'm going to delve a little bit into
the nature of the internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll see why in a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and then I'm going to talk about
Pennsylvania challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Specifically the East Coast challenges of
the whole East Coast as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_07]: West Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some special projects that
emerged from those challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: So last summer I spent at Walt's Vineyard
in Manheim, Pennsylvania, which is in
[SPEAKER_07]: Lancaster County.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a six generation farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only been growing grapes since 1997
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the way that I ended up with the
internship is I swapped posts with their
[SPEAKER_07]: son essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: So their son is also a viticulture and
knowledge major and they lost him for the
[SPEAKER_06]: summer for the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they needed someone with some knowledge
in the arena to come take on a workload
[SPEAKER_07]: and to kind of advise them on certain
areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how I ended up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's a little bit of an
unstructured format for the internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the challenges, getting into
the challenges of the East Coast and
[SPEAKER_07]: Pennsylvania in particular.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of climatic factors on
the East Coast that we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the big ones that we dealt with
that summer was there was a harsh winter
[SPEAKER_07]: beforehand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Venetian vines, which we use for wine
grapes, are not particularly cold hardy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we have cold winters, we end up
with dead vines and dead buds,
[SPEAKER_07]: which gives us a lot lower yields,
which can be a real problem as far as
[SPEAKER_07]: economics of running an estate winery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that we dealt with is on the
East Coast there's a lot of humidity and
[SPEAKER_07]: there is a lot more water going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that particular summer we had a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of flooding in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some issues that accompany that are
erosion.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it really, really difficult to
run tractors in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can slide, things can fall,
and it can also damage the vines of
[SPEAKER_07]: course.
[SPEAKER_07]: It also increases the prevalence of
disease because obviously a lot of fungi
[SPEAKER_07]: are spread through water transportation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we get that much rain,
not only are we dealing with droplets,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're literally dealing with floods of
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also they're in state wineries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they grow all of their own grapes and
turn it into wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a very, they're a very small
estate winery.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have a very loyal pool of
customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they like to do fun events with them
over the summer to retain their loyalty.
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't do that because a lot of
climatic factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they lost some revenue that way too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the other things is invasive
pests have these on the East Coast and
[SPEAKER_07]: they also have these on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the ones that we were dealing with
over the summer was the Japanese beetle,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I'm sure most people are familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that pretty guy right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They eat the photosynthetic tissue,
which can ultimately lead to a degreased
[SPEAKER_07]: meal, but it takes a lot in order to get
to that point with grapes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are taken care of with a spray
program done by the Vineyard Manager.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the fun thing that we got to do this
summer was we had some exposure to the
[SPEAKER_07]: spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure some of you guys have heard about
this, but the spotted lanternfly is a
[SPEAKER_07]: brand new pest coming over from Asia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll show you a map in here just a
second, but we found spotted lanternfly
[SPEAKER_07]: nests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I personally found spotted
lanternfly nests in the vineyard that
[SPEAKER_07]: summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually a picture that I took of
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was probably about 40 nymphs on that
specific vine, but they were very
[SPEAKER_07]: localized.
[SPEAKER_07]: They only stayed on like one or two vines
in the same row and they didn't even row
[SPEAKER_07]: hop, even though they can hop real,
real fricking high.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the map of where they existed
at the end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: The green is where it's been looked for
and not found.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the brown is where it's been
found and is trying to be quarantined.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's like right in there
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's about as far west as this thing
has gotten so far, which is why it was so
[SPEAKER_07]: cool to find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to work with a task force from
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Pennsylvania State.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to try and determine the effects
it's going to have on the viticultural
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another project that I got to work on has
to do with the cold hardiness I was
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about, or the lack thereof,
in vinifera vines.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was working with Professor Michaela
Centonari and she does work on cover
[SPEAKER_07]: crops.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cover crops are used, or under vine
cover crops, specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the East Coast, we have a ton of
inter-row cover crops because we have so
[SPEAKER_07]: much organic matter and so much water that
just everything grows and you have things
[SPEAKER_07]: covering.
[SPEAKER_07]: But under the vines, we've started
instituting some cover crops in order to
[SPEAKER_07]: reduce vigor of the vines because of that
organic matter and the water content over
[SPEAKER_07]: the summer that I also talked about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The vines get ridiculously huge,
which isn't necessarily good for our grape
[SPEAKER_07]: yields.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order to help control that,
we plant things under the vines.
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem with that is that on the East
Coast, we do this thing called peeling up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the top part of this vine is vinifera.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the part we care about.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bottom part is called the root stone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not as expensive and it's the reason
that this vine can grow in the soil at
[SPEAKER_07]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really well suited to this
habitat, but it's not the part that's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to give us the grapes that we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to protect the top part,
but this is the only part that's
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily going to survive the winter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we take the dirt and we move it up over
this grafting to try and protect the
[SPEAKER_07]: valuable commodity part of the vine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you're digging up the dirt every
winter, you can't really keep a perennial
[SPEAKER_07]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are the ones that have been
shown to compete with the vines and reduce
[SPEAKER_07]: vigor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Michaela Centenario is working on
annual cover crops to see if they can help
[SPEAKER_07]: control the vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are just the cover crops that we
were working with.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did rye, millet, and chicory.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did rye, millet, and chicory.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's at the beginning of the season,
about a week and a half after I helped
[SPEAKER_07]: them plant it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I was doing over the summer was
taking measurements for her.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing right here, it's got some
webbed strings on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically I was doing a percent
coverage to see how well it was taking.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just the initial stages of it,
so we don't have any results from it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But ultimately, she's going to start
taking measurements on vigor reduction,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we planted it too late this year,
so we can do that this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it should start next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some conclusions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, there's a lot of challenges
on the East Coast, including the climate,
[SPEAKER_07]: so the water that we're dealing with,
the cold we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of pests that we're dealing
with, because obviously we're on the front
[SPEAKER_07]: line for invasive pests.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pests from Asia, as we got to see this
summer, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously we do not have the same
reputation as the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in addition to it being harder to grow
grapes here, it's also harder to sell
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Overall, I think they're doing a fantastic
job in resiliently responding as evidenced
[SPEAKER_07]: with the projects that I got to help with
this summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as final notes, I just want to say
thank you to the whole Waltz family,
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically Zach, for getting out of my
way so I could take over.
[SPEAKER_07]: To Mikayla Centonari for letting me help
with her research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Justine Vanden Heuvel, my advisor,
and she put up with a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_07]: that I threw out here over the summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as well as the rest of the crew at
Well State.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_19]: Not a question, but I wanted to mention
that Mikayla Centonari will be giving a
[SPEAKER_19]: horticulture lecture this fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if everyone can hear that,
but he said that Mikayla Centonari will be
[SPEAKER_07]: giving a horticultural seminar this fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: So definitely check that out because she
really knows what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_20]: The drug-drug interaction refers to the
unexpected response due to the code
[SPEAKER_20]: administration of two or multiple drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: And now the simultaneous use of multiple
drugs becomes very prevalent, especially
[SPEAKER_20]: in elder people.
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is the outcome when you're taking
two drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first outcome is the action will
decrease.
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, when you have two drugs and
they compete for the same protein target,
[SPEAKER_20]: then the action will decrease.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the second case is when one drug will
catalyze another drug, then the action
[SPEAKER_20]: will increase.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the third outcome is that they will
cause adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the aim of our study.
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to predict the adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_20]: Like if two drugs will cause adverse
effect.
[SPEAKER_20]: So previous studies have explored a lot of
features to predict the drug-drug
[SPEAKER_20]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, the drug-side effect
similarity.
[SPEAKER_20]: So when two drugs have the same side
effect, taking two drugs together is
[SPEAKER_20]: equivalent to increase drug dosage.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's very useful, but it cannot provide
any molecular insights into the drug-drug
[SPEAKER_20]: interaction, as seen as a drug indication
and drug target sequence similarity.
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this study, we come up with an old
feature, the genetic interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the genetic interaction refers to the
deviation from the expected phenotype.
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, when you only mutate gene
A, the fitness will decrease from one to
[SPEAKER_20]: point A.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then if you only mutate gene B,
the fitness will decrease to point five.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the expected fitness is a product,
which is point eight times point five
[SPEAKER_20]: equals point four.
[SPEAKER_20]: However, when you knock out both genes,
the actual fitness is point two,
[SPEAKER_20]: which is lower than expected.
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called negative genetic interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's the relationship between
drug-drug interaction and genetic
[SPEAKER_20]: interaction?
[SPEAKER_20]: So for example, when you have two drugs,
each drug will find their coding targets.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the coding targets is encoded by their
genes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So if the genetic interaction score
between these two genes is pretty low,
[SPEAKER_20]: then it will cause an adverse drug-drug
interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So to test our assumption, we first
compare the distribution of genetic
[SPEAKER_20]: interaction score in adverse interaction
drug pairs and non-interaction drug pairs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So from the top, we can see the red box
represents the interaction drug pairs.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the blue box represents the
non-interaction drug pairs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the genetic interaction in the
interacting drug pairs is much lower than
[SPEAKER_20]: that of the non-interaction drug pair.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it matches our assumption.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that indicates that genetic interaction
is a useful feature for predicting
[SPEAKER_20]: drug-drug interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we use a machine learning approach to
predict the drag-drag interaction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the basic idea behind machine learning
is that you have a labeled data set,
[SPEAKER_20]: then you put the labeled data set into a
computer algorithm, and the algorithm will
[SPEAKER_20]: learn some rules or patterns from the
labeled data set.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you put a new unlabeled data set
into the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_20]: The algorithm will give you an answer if
it's interacting or non-interacting.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first step is to split the data set
into training set and test set.
[SPEAKER_20]: So previously, most studies just randomly
split drug pairs into training drugs and
[SPEAKER_20]: test drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: However, in that case, the drug can appear
in both training set and test set.
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, drug A, drug B is in the
training set, and drug B, drug C is in the
[SPEAKER_20]: test set.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the drug B appears in both training set
and test set, which could cause an
[SPEAKER_20]: information leak.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the model will be overfitted.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we come to a novel spritz scheme.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we first split the drugs into training
drugs and the test drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the side represents the drugs,
and each square is a drug pair.
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the data set, in total, we have like
262 drugs and 12,000 drug pairs.
[SPEAKER_20]: And we first split the drugs into training
drugs and test drugs with a ratio of 2 to
[SPEAKER_20]: 1.
[SPEAKER_20]: So our training set will only consist of
drug pairs where both drugs are training
[SPEAKER_20]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: And our test set will only consist of drug
pairs where both drugs are test drugs.
[SPEAKER_20]: So these two sets are totally independent.
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't share any information.
[SPEAKER_20]: And further, the big training set will be
divided into a smaller training set and
[SPEAKER_20]: validation set for training the model.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the model we use is called extreme
gradient boost, XG boost.
[SPEAKER_20]: It has a lot of hyperparameters.
[SPEAKER_20]: So just a screenshot, it has a lot of
hyperparameters.
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's like impossible for you to tune
the hyperparameters manually, because it's
[SPEAKER_20]: a super high dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we use a method called TPE to tune the
hyperparameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the result.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the TPE will run the training life for
2,000 iterations.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first eight cars is the eight
hyperparameters.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the last one is the model performance.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the X actually represents the 2,000
iterations.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Y axis is the value of the
hyperparameter.
[SPEAKER_20]: So at the beginning, the model is just
like a random search.
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a very wide searching space.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then gradually, it converges to some
certain value.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the model performance keeps
increasing.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that means the TPE is very useful for
searching the optimal combination of the
[SPEAKER_20]: hyperparameters.
[SPEAKER_20]: And next is the model performance and the
feature in product.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we use the four features mentioned
before to construct a predictive model.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the one we use all features,
the AUC is like 0.7.
[SPEAKER_20]: AUC is a metric for evaluation of the
model performance, the highest pattern.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we want to compare our normal
feature with the other previously used
[SPEAKER_20]: features.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we drop each feature at a time and
train the model and evaluate its
[SPEAKER_20]: performance.
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you drop the side effect,
the model performance drops to 0.71.
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you drop the indication,
it drops to 0.7.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you drop the genetic interaction,
it drops to the 0.67, which drops most.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that means the genetic interaction is
the most important feature.
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we also evaluate our model on the
test set.
[SPEAKER_20]: So for the top-temp prediction,
it achieves 100% precision.
[SPEAKER_20]: And here's a case study, which shows why
the genetic interaction can provide the
[SPEAKER_20]: interaction to the molecular mechanism of
the drug retraction.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first drug we're buying,
a protocol, AKT1.
[SPEAKER_20]: And AKT1 is the activation of the
transcription of the assay by a gene.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the other drug we are buying based
protein, which is a sodium channel.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the sodium channel is encoded by this
gene.
[SPEAKER_20]: So when you're taking these two drugs
together, the amount of the sodium channel
[SPEAKER_20]: will decrease to a larger extent,
which might cause some adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the genetic interaction data used in
this study are from yeast, because there
[SPEAKER_20]: is no comprehensive, like large scale
human genetic interaction set.
[SPEAKER_20]: So people may argue, like, our model is
not accurate, because it's not for humans.
[SPEAKER_20]: However, we obtained two small human
genetic interactions, which is of small
[SPEAKER_20]: scale.
[SPEAKER_20]: But the trend stays the same.
[SPEAKER_20]: The genetic interaction score in the
intact drug case is much lower than that
[SPEAKER_20]: of the non-intact drug case.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's a future direction.
[SPEAKER_20]: When there is more and more human genetic
interaction data, our model will be more
[SPEAKER_20]: and more accurate.
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to say to my PI, and my cause,
and all the members.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will be presenting today on my
internship at Ball Border Culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just an overview of what I'm going to
be talking about today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk to you about where I did
my internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was supposed to be doing,
and why I was doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What actually ended up happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: The garden design that I kind of pieced
together at the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of my takeaways from the
overall internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just to give you kind of this
nice bird's eye view of where I was
[SPEAKER_07]: working.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in West Chicago, where the main ball
offices are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have about nine acres of planted
beds to show off all of their products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the internship was supposed to be
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was supposed to help plant, but then I
was also supposed to have a larger focus
[SPEAKER_07]: on vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had more experience with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also design and begin working on
a chef's garden for that location.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this picture, they actually built these
beds while I was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just one of the areas where I was
working.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was the Pan-American seed area.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure if everyone knows,
but Ball Border Culture actually owns a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of different companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they actually compete with one another.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very confusing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the people that work there
don't even know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a really cool place to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why did I drive 14 hours in a car with
my father all the way out to West Chicago?
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ball itself is just a really amazing
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's run by this wonderful woman,
Anna Ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is one of the largest wholesale
distributors of horticultural plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then also with my concentration in
plants and human health, I have an
[SPEAKER_07]: interest in plants for personal use.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's extremely important for
health and well-being, not only for
[SPEAKER_07]: ourselves as individuals, but also for
ourselves as a society.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, I'm interested in landscape
architecture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the ability to design a garden is
really what drew me to this internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Chicago itself is just a really
cool city.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have beautiful museums.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of my most favorite paintings is
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a really great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what actually ended up happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: The first day that I got there,
I know that things don't always work out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first day that I got there,
I was meeting my supervisors for the first
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first thing they said to me was,
oh, by the way, remember that garden you
[SPEAKER_07]: were supposed to make?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that put me in a really awkward
position because I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: what am I going to be getting out of this
experience I've planted before?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that all I'm going to get out of this?
[SPEAKER_08]: So halfway through the summer,
all I've been doing is planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realized I really needed to advocate
for myself so I could get something out of
[SPEAKER_07]: this internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of stitched something that was
very close to what it was originally
[SPEAKER_07]: supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't get to do everything I was
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did get to do vegetable care.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I ended up doing more was
coordinating with the people that work at
[SPEAKER_07]: Ball Gorticulture for the specific
companies that produce vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they have burpee, they have
Pan-American seed, and then they also had
[SPEAKER_07]: a trialing area with some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have this AIS bed, which is an
area kind of where they win awards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really sure that my supervisor was
supposed to eat all of these hot peppers
[SPEAKER_07]: and things like that because he was always
in pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I ended up doing was just making
sure that everything looked good for
[SPEAKER_07]: customer day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ball has these beautiful gardens,
and they're only used for one very
[SPEAKER_07]: specific day where they invite all of
their customers to come to their property
[SPEAKER_07]: and have a barbecue but also be targeted
by sales reps while they're walking
[SPEAKER_07]: through the gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all I really had to do was coordinate
harvesting and pruning to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: they looked good for this one specific
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did get to take home the vegetables,
so that was a nice part.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also did end up getting to do a
garden design.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as you can see, it's not exactly high
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it in Microsoft Paint, which is not
exactly a drafting program.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of like, hey, there's a marker,
and draw on this piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually ended up doing it to scale,
which was very difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to blow it up for you in a
second so that you can see the individual
[SPEAKER_07]: parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to orient you, this garden,
so the cafe is right here, and the garden
[SPEAKER_07]: would have been right here outside of the
cafe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Ball is knocking down buildings and
building new ones, so we don't know if
[SPEAKER_07]: it's actually going to end up being there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that played a big role in what I ended
up designing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the top part of my design.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would have been right up next close
to the cafe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has an herb wall, and then
different planting beds that are suited
[SPEAKER_07]: for different vegetables stacked in
different ways just to make it presentable
[SPEAKER_07]: because Ball's customers do go through
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the idea of the garden is to say,
hey, look, we also eat our own products,
[SPEAKER_07]: and these are great products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other parts of this include areas for
plants that need to be more on the ground,
[SPEAKER_07]: so plants that spread a little bit more,
squash plants, green beans and things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that, different types of tomatoes,
and then other beds specifically for
[SPEAKER_07]: carrots, beets, radishes, and then an area
for any type of harvesting material that
[SPEAKER_07]: the chef would need because ideally this
would be run just by the chef,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the garden's team wouldn't have
another thing that they needed to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this area over here is for
melons, and then we have this big squash
[SPEAKER_07]: trellis that you would be able to walk
under, and all this autumn squash that
[SPEAKER_07]: would hang down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you walk through, you would get to
have all these really pretty pictures.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of the idea because all of Ball
needs to be extremely aesthetically
[SPEAKER_07]: pleasing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this may seem a little out of context,
but all of my takeaways come from being
[SPEAKER_07]: there, sitting in on meetings,
hearing what's going on, all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: politics of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I enjoyed my time there, sort of.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a very interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ball is going through this really big
transitional phase.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I was saying, they're knocking down
buildings, building new ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this weird transitional period,
but it's all physical transitions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So while I was there, the garden's team,
they were given all these changes,
[SPEAKER_07]: all these new responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: It made it harder for them to get their
job done.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it put us interns in a really awkward
position because they couldn't really tend
[SPEAKER_07]: to us and tend to the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ball actually didn't even offer that
position this year because there's just no
[SPEAKER_07]: gardens to even plant at this point
because they're knocking so many things
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing that's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I said that they're going through this
physical change.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also going through this internal
change, but very slowly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much of Ball is made up of old white
men.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have this beautiful, amazing woman
president, but that doesn't exactly make
[SPEAKER_07]: up for the fact that every single
department is run by an older white male.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's really a lack of diversity
there in upper management.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of us interns just felt very
unwelcome there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're all working with these heads of
these departments, but most of us are
[SPEAKER_07]: younger women.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were all just very uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all of these people are retiring.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ball is looking for younger people to
come in, but they're doing a very,
[SPEAKER_08]: very bad job at making it acceptable,
making it more modern.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every intern that I talked to was not
thrilled about working there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a really weird place to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so with that, I would like to
say thank you to some of the people that I
[SPEAKER_07]: worked with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheney was one of the recruiters.
[SPEAKER_07]: She recruited me.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_07]: Josh Kirshenbaum, who was one of the
people that I worked with for coordinating
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetables while I was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my two supervisors, Sam and
Rachel.
[SPEAKER_07]: This man is one of the most intimidating
men I ever met at First Look, but then I
[SPEAKER_07]: found out that he's a teddy bear and I
love him so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are just some photos from my
time there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and the other garden intern,
we were up at like four o'clock in the
[SPEAKER_07]: morning to get the gardens ready for
customer day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then for the rest of the day,
we just colored in the kids' tents.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got paid for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was very nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we had a tradition of breakfast
tacos.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the apartments were actually very
nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was a nice perk.
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did I learn?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I learned about plant science.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did I learn about plant science?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get to learn a little bit about how
to manage plants for a purely aesthetic
[SPEAKER_07]: reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hadn't previously had that kind of
experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had previously worked for Stone Barns in
Westchester, where all of it is production
[SPEAKER_08]: for the restaurant, rather than making
sure that everything just looks good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a very different way of planting,
a different way of thinking about things.
[SPEAKER_07]: If something looked bad, we just tore it
out and tossed a new one in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was no real sustainability model
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, I think because we were
scrambling so much, I wasn't able to be
[SPEAKER_07]: taught as much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was more like me learning on the job
as I went.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be talking about my REU
research experience for undergrads at NC
[SPEAKER_08]: State that I did last summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked in Dr. Ralph Dean's lab working
on rice flasks, which is caused by the
[SPEAKER_08]: fungal pathogen, Magna Porta Urizi.
[SPEAKER_08]: So rice is a staple food crop that feeds
over half the world's population.
[SPEAKER_08]: And rice flasks alone causes 30% of the
annual reduction of rice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's about 60 million people going
without a major carb source.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's a picture of the symptoms
that causes on rice weeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here are the actual structures of
Magna Porta, which I'll go into further
[SPEAKER_08]: detail in the next slide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little bit more background
information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Magna Porta is a hemibiotrope,
meaning that part of its life stage,
[SPEAKER_08]: it requires live plant tissue to gain
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it turns into a necrotrope,
where it relies on dead tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's a life cycle of Magna Porta.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a canidium, which is an asexual
spore.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that germinates and creates this
afrosorium, which is the structure that
[SPEAKER_08]: builds lots and lots of trigger pressure,
where it can actually penetrate through a
[SPEAKER_08]: plant's cell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this fungus doesn't need natural
openings or wounds to infiltrate a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's infiltrating and it doesn't want
the plant to know it's there, so what it
[SPEAKER_08]: does is it secretes proteins called
effectors, which interact with plant
[SPEAKER_08]: defense by either making the plant not
know it's there or shutting down certain
[SPEAKER_08]: systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so a common tactic that plants use is
program cell death, where they'll kill off
[SPEAKER_08]: certain section of their cells,
which is bad news for Magna Porta,
[SPEAKER_08]: because right now it wants the plant to be
alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my project is based off of a previous
study by William Sharpie.
[SPEAKER_08]: He actually found a bunch of these
candidate effectors of Magna Porta.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what he did was he used NEP1,
which is a known protein to elicit program
[SPEAKER_08]: cell death.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he used his candidate effectors,
which he named SPD, which stands for
[SPEAKER_08]: Suppressor Plant Cell Death.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he infiltrated them at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you can see here's just NEP1 alone,
where it's total cell death.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's where the effector is partially
suppressing the cell death.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he found 11 of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I chose five of them to transform rice
plants to see which proteins Magna Porta
[SPEAKER_08]: bind to in the rice plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here are the five that I chose.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of words up here,
but I'm just showing you that a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: these have already been characterized in
other fungal systems, and most of them are
[SPEAKER_08]: actually needed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're essential for infection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only one that's really not
characterized is this SPD4, which I
[SPEAKER_08]: labeled as A6.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's just an overview of my
project.
[SPEAKER_08]: I first constructed vectors.
[SPEAKER_08]: I then transferred them into agrobacterium
to then transform rice cali.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the same time, I keep growing rice
cali.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I eventually grow them out into
rice plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's just a schematic of me just
building my vector.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot going on, but I'm just
going to go and explain it step by step.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first I'm going to talk about this
black semicircle here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used this backbone called PBDL03.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's important is a
kinamycin-resistant gene, which is used
[SPEAKER_08]: for selection.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this site here, site A to D,
which will be cut out, and my genome
[SPEAKER_08]: interest will be replaced here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So attached to site A and D is this ATTR
region.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's important about this region is
they have this gene called the CCDB gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this just inhibits cell division so
that after ligation or gluing my genome
[SPEAKER_08]: interest, if this section ends up
re-bluing itself here, the bacteria cell
[SPEAKER_08]: that has this vector or this plasmid will
end up dying because they can't divide.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I did, all my gene inserts had
these loci here, KPN1 and SAC1,
[SPEAKER_08]: which correspond to each of the sites.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I cut that out, and then I ligated them
or blued them until I got a transformed
[SPEAKER_08]: PBDL03 vector.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I used heat shock method to
insert them into E.
[SPEAKER_08]: coli.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this strain, the DH5 alpha,
it's extremely sensitive to the CCDBG.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so heat shocking is just shocking the
cells with heat so that they open up their
[SPEAKER_08]: pores so that the vector can just slip in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so after doing that, I plated the
bacterium onto petri dishes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did overnight with my fingers
crossed, hoping to see this.
[SPEAKER_08]: After many, many weeks of not getting
anything, I finally got colonies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it made me super happy, but just
because I got colonies doesn't mean they
[SPEAKER_08]: actually have my gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would take one of these colonies,
I would stab them with a toothpick,
[SPEAKER_08]: put them in a PCR tube, and then also put
them onto new media just to confirm that
[SPEAKER_08]: my genes are there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's a picture of them on a new fresh
plate as well as getting ready to be put
[SPEAKER_08]: in PCR.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so my results, I actually got genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really, really faint.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really what we want to see,
but they're there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after sequencing, I confirmed that the
genes were there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's one of the genes I could blend.
[SPEAKER_08]: This gray area is actually a gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just not strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm like, all right, that's good
enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Move on to the next step.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I then extracted the vector and then
inserted it into this strain of
[SPEAKER_08]: agrobacterium using electroporation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the same kind of idea with heat
shock.
[SPEAKER_08]: But instead of using heat to shock them,
I electrocuted them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's a picture of my agrobacterium
cells and my vectors literally chilling
[SPEAKER_08]: and then getting ready to be electrocuted
in this machine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my results, there's a lot of me
crossing my fingers waiting to see if I
[SPEAKER_08]: would get colonies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I finally did.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I couldn't actually get that nice
picture of the backbone and then the gene
[SPEAKER_08]: inserts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I did instead, so here's one of
the genes from the coli, the vector that I
[SPEAKER_08]: took out from.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the one from the agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just amplified the gene region,
and I did get these genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was enough confirmation for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: After doing it so many times, I just moved
on to transforming rice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I was making all these vectors,
I also had to make rice cali.
[SPEAKER_08]: And rice cali is just undifferentiated
parenchyma cells.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I first tossed the rice, surface
sterilized them, and placed them onto
[SPEAKER_08]: these petri dishes with calc induction
media.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after two weeks, it takes some of
these friable cali and move them onto a
[SPEAKER_08]: new plate and just wait for them to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So then next, the transformation process.
[SPEAKER_08]: I infected the rice cali with
agrobacterium culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I poured off the excess liquid
and blotted them dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, I would place them onto co-culture
media, which enables both the rice cali
[SPEAKER_08]: and the agrobacterium to keep on growing,
but only for three days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I then transferred the rice cali onto
selection media so that the agrobacterium
[SPEAKER_08]: and the cali that didn't transform would
die.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were actually grown in a dark
chamber for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the results of this, some good news.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is some cali that aren't completely
brown like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this, and kind of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is at the end of my nine week
internship.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to actually keep on going and
grow out the rice all the way to full
[SPEAKER_08]: plants and be able to see what proteins
they bind into.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next step was more rounds of
selection.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was only after two weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have to do three more rounds of
selection.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have to grow out the little
rice cali into full plant, perform a cold
[SPEAKER_08]: on assay, which is just seeing what
protein the course of protein binded to
[SPEAKER_08]: the plant and pull it down on the seed to
determine the interactions between the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant and the course of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually contacted my mentor and she
said that actually at this step they were
[SPEAKER_08]: pulling down all of the proteins and
they're about to analyze which proteins
[SPEAKER_08]: they find.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to thank the Dean Lab for
hosting me over the summer, for my mentor
[SPEAKER_08]: Yanni, for the rest of the lab,
especially Ming-Ying, who helped me grow
[SPEAKER_08]: agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had such a hard time getting those
things to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the last lab that let me grow
agrobacterium.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a picture of their research
extension up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are my references.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everyone, I'm Meg Lobier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a senior in plant science and I would
like to tell you guys about my summer as a
[SPEAKER_07]: horticulture intern at the Cornell Botanic
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this summer I did a lot of things and
one of the things I did was actually
[SPEAKER_07]: rediscovered my love of painting.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something I did a lot in high
school but sometimes when you come to
[SPEAKER_07]: Cornell you lose time for things you had
time for before.
[SPEAKER_07]: But during the summer I actually for the
internship spent a day doing watercolors
[SPEAKER_07]: and it reminded me how much I love
painting and that this was a great
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity to pick that hobby back up
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I pulled out my gouache kit which is a
special type of paint that's kind of in
[SPEAKER_07]: between an oil and watercolor and I
started painting some flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this flower in particular is actually
on the screen because this is the one I
[SPEAKER_07]: painted during the Botanic Garden
internship and what's special about it to
[SPEAKER_07]: me right now is that this is a
rhododendron which is rhododendrons at the
[SPEAKER_07]: Cornell Botanic Gardens are underneath the
care of Phil Seifert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil Seifert is the director of the intern
program at the Botanic Gardens and well
[SPEAKER_07]: the time I picked it because I thought it
was a really pretty flower and you'll
[SPEAKER_07]: quickly see that pink flowers are a theme
in most of these paintings.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really nice looking back and
realizing that I made something that had
[SPEAKER_07]: this connection to him because without him
this program wouldn't have happened and I
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't have had this amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the summer started off with a lot of
hard work very quickly which is becoming a
[SPEAKER_07]: common theme in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a very late spring last spring.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I guess so we had to do a lot of the
annual printing very quickly see how much
[SPEAKER_07]: we get done before we even weekend right
after 4th of July, sorry right after
[SPEAKER_07]: Memorial Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got to work pretty much immediately
on growth on planting and the annuals.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the first ones I did this is one of
my very first days here at the gardens was
[SPEAKER_07]: that I planted the medicinal herbs bed in
the herbs garden which ended up being one
[SPEAKER_07]: of my favorite beds not only because I
basically planted the entire thing in one
[SPEAKER_07]: day but also because as a plant and human
health concentrator it was really cool
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to see plants that I could
relate back to my own personal interests.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you might be able to recognize up at
the top up here some Ricinus which is a
[SPEAKER_07]: very old plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for its medicinal property,
for its castor oil, but also there's some
[SPEAKER_07]: new ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just here at the bottom it's your
Catheranthus, your Madagascar periwinkle
[SPEAKER_07]: which is used for the anti-cancer drugs of
Benchristine and Benblastine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me not only was it interesting to
be able to see these plants and that they
[SPEAKER_07]: could grow here in upstate New York but
also be able to see kind of like the short
[SPEAKER_07]: history of medicine like all one bed
pretty much all in one day for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course there's a lot of other work
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I quickly learned that I was not a fan of
compost or adding compost to beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not really my personal best skills.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course the plants didn't really
look like this when I started planting the
[SPEAKER_07]: bed but it was really interesting being
able to go back throughout the internship
[SPEAKER_07]: and just seeing them grow and seeing them
change with the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: Offstate Ithaca is not always beautiful
and sunny like it was yesterday so there
[SPEAKER_07]: were a lot of rainy days and most of those
we'd actually spend in the plant
[SPEAKER_07]: production facility up kind of high up in
the arboretum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of work there to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just one woman Cathy in charge of
pretty much the entire thing the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: summer and she would always need as much
help as she could get.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other intense and I both loved
hanging out with Cathy but also being able
[SPEAKER_07]: to get out of the rain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This picture right here is that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually another one of Phil's
strange conifers.
[SPEAKER_07]: He really loves those and loves explaining
how unique the conifer family is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was important to me not just
because I thought it was a really cool
[SPEAKER_07]: plant but also to kind of show that the
PPF and the head gardens in general have a
[SPEAKER_07]: really good variety of all the different
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really cool being in the PPF
and being able to see plants from around
[SPEAKER_07]: the world kind of all crammed together
underneath one roof.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have these umbrella pines next to a
whole room of coleus, next to banana
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, next to pineapples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really interesting being to have
that variety all under one roof all
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's some other stuff that
went on too.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a lot of integrated pest management
at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because the botanic gardens are about
visitor interpretation having the people
[SPEAKER_07]: interact with the plants we try to lean
away from traditional pesticides and other
[SPEAKER_07]: things that could be harmful to visitors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what that meant in practice,
I spent a lot of time picking bugs on
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, including these Japanese beetles
right here, which while they actually do
[SPEAKER_02]: make a pretty good painting, they love to
eat your rose buds, which is the only part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the rose plant you really grow roses
for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I spent a lot of time leaning into rose
bushes, picking these off and trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: catch them and then just watching them
roll off the gender instead.
[SPEAKER_07]: So not the hardest work I could have done,
but definitely not the most fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was other stuff going on too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this summer they did find both hemlock
woolly adelgid and the emerald ash borer
[SPEAKER_07]: in the botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew they're coming for a long time,
but it was still very sad to see them
[SPEAKER_07]: finally show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there are practices currently
going on to manage the population.
[SPEAKER_07]: On a slightly happier note though,
there was a rabbit in the herb garden that
[SPEAKER_07]: we spent a long time trying to catch and
never eventually did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while some of the other stories about
pest management were pretty sad during the
[SPEAKER_07]: summer, it was still very funny in the end
seeing the gardener shake their fists at
[SPEAKER_07]: all the rabbits and chipmunks,
which again do real damage, but still very
[SPEAKER_07]: funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another aspect of the internship were
learning Mondays, where all the interns
[SPEAKER_07]: from all the different departments would
get together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'd have a day learning
something new about the botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of this was stuff like the
watercolors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another day was going to an undisclosed
bog and having the garden botanist,
[SPEAKER_07]: Robert, show us these very rare orchids
deep in the bog.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really cool being able to see
these flowers that could be found I think
[SPEAKER_07]: nowhere else in the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: But other things really took you outside
my comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we spent a day, actually two days with
the arborists, both climbing trees and
[SPEAKER_07]: learning how to use chainsaws.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent a day with construction crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: And other things that you don't really
think about when you think about what the
[SPEAKER_07]: roles that need to go on for the botanic
garden to function.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we spent a day, for example,
learning about fundraising.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one for me was actually something
very eye-opening too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the big thing I kind of pulled out of
all of this is that visitor interpretation
[SPEAKER_07]: is rightfully the current main goal of the
botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: One story I learned at the time that
happened before I showed up was the story
[SPEAKER_07]: of this katapa tree in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the katapa had been in the gardens for
decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was one of the people's favorite
things when they came to see this tree in
[SPEAKER_07]: the gardens, because it was right smack in
the middle of the flower garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people just reduced its presence
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But after one point, the arborists decided
that it was old and it was in threat of
[SPEAKER_07]: falling on people and plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they had to remove the top half of it,
which people were very sad about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually got a little angry when
they realized the plant wasn't actually
[SPEAKER_07]: dead.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you can tell by the leaves kind of
coming back up on here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have these people who are very kind
of confused and angry, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: why did you cut down this perfectly fine
tree?
[SPEAKER_07]: This tree that we all love to care for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was the idea of the graphic
designer of the gardens to actually make
[SPEAKER_07]: into an art piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they cut this hole here in the middle
of the tree, suck a bell in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, well, still mostly it's some of
the trees and leaves growing off of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It now has some meaning to it that's come
back to the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tell this story because I do think
it's a good way of indicating all the
[SPEAKER_07]: different parts of the botanic gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have the planting cells,
which have meaning to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have people who are concerned about
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have concerns for people's safety and
for the integrity of the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you also have making it into
something meaningful, bringing all those
[SPEAKER_07]: things together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is the biggest thing I really
learned from my internship is that one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the most important things I think the
plant science community do is to share
[SPEAKER_07]: their knowledge with other people and to
share their passions for other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, whether you're trying to
encourage conservation or feed the world
[SPEAKER_07]: or you just really love growing a specific
cultivar or something, the most important
[SPEAKER_07]: thing we can do is to share with others
and to raise awareness and raise
[SPEAKER_07]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: In particular, I would like to thank Phil
Seifert again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank Emily Dietrich and Sadie
Powers for helping me later on with a
[SPEAKER_07]: project and to Pam Shade for being a
grandmother to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Corrigan Herbert.
[SPEAKER_07]: My major is medical serinology,
but I did a plant science honors thesis
[SPEAKER_07]: this past year on the impact of shoot
thinning to manipulate the shoot vigor and
[SPEAKER_07]: to see if that has anything to do with the
timing of cluster closure and re-sign.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just a few terms before I go into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoot thinning is just pulling off the
shoots from the vine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do this mostly to improve the
microclimate of the vine.
[SPEAKER_07]: As the shoots get big, they will start to
crowd each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So pulling them off helps with that a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also manipulate your yield a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoot vigor is just an increase in the
shoot length and often shoot diameter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see in the lower picture
there, that's a very vigorous shoot
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's almost the width of a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_07]: We would definitely think that that was
way too vigorous.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's a good example.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple other terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cluster closure is when all the berries
start to touch each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this picture up here, you can see
these berries are so close together that
[SPEAKER_07]: they are like squishing each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll go into how important that timing
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's basically what it means.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's closed off from the rest of,
like the inside of the cluster is closed
[SPEAKER_07]: off from the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the outside berries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then hedging is something that we do a
lot in New York vineyards because the
[SPEAKER_07]: vines are so vigorous.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll grow very tall and they can
overshade the next rows.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this tractor is actually cutting the
top of the shoots right there with that
[SPEAKER_07]: blade.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the importance of cluster closure is
that, like the timing of it specifically,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that the inside of the clusters,
once they are closed, are dark and damp.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that really promotes fungal diseases,
as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also, when the berries start to
touch each other, they can easily spread
[SPEAKER_07]: the disease from one berry to the next to
the next.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see in this picture right
here, there's a bunch of bunch rot all
[SPEAKER_07]: over those berries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the farmer is going to want to know
when that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they want to spray pesticides
before that happens so that they can
[SPEAKER_07]: protect the inside of the cluster.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked at one of the management
practices that we do is shoot thinning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to see if that had any effect
on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this figure is kind of just showing you
how soil and climate and then cultural
[SPEAKER_07]: decisions all play into the vine
physiology and fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, the vigor as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shoot thinning is definitely
considered a cultural decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it should have some effect on the vigor
and the fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then these two pictures here,
this is just to show you that this is
[SPEAKER_07]: before cluster closure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see in between the berries
still.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this is that same picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't see anywhere between these
berries.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for my methods, I just had three
different levels of shoot thinning
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the block.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had a control course.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I shoot them to three, five,
and seven shoots per length of the
[SPEAKER_07]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this picture just shows you like
the before and after you shoot them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do it early in the season when
they're small because that's the easiest
[SPEAKER_07]: time to pull the shoots off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can see in this picture how
it really opens up the canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is early.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll grow back together, but it helps a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for my data collection, I measured
shoot vigor by diameters because the vines
[SPEAKER_07]: are hedged like three or four times in the
season in New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't really measure shoot length.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll talk about that more later.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that that's important to,
well, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so I measured shoot vigor by
diameter with these calipers up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then cluster closure timing,
there isn't really like a defined way to
[SPEAKER_07]: do that yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I created this rating scale in the blue
chart there, five being completely closed
[SPEAKER_07]: and one was like maybe a berry or two are
touching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also measured compaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because wine grapes tend to be very
compact.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of the issue with at
cluster closure.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very compact together,
which means like all the berries are
[SPEAKER_07]: squishing and the rachis length and the
size of the berries will determine that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Up here you can see this is the rachis and
then these are the berries pulled off of
[SPEAKER_07]: it just so that everyone knows what a
rachis is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so if you have smaller berries and a
longer rachis, they'll be less compact.
[SPEAKER_07]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So and then I looked at yield because I
was pulling off fruitful shoots.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was important to see if that was
changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then disease because that's the whole
issue here is that the disease,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of disease pressure with the
compaction and the time of the cluster
[SPEAKER_07]: closure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then juice composition because they
are wine grapes and that's important for
[SPEAKER_07]: the winemakers to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for my results, nothing really changed
that I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So closure timing didn't change at all,
at least not significantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then shoot diameter didn't change
because my way of measuring bigger and
[SPEAKER_07]: disease didn't either.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was no real differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only difference I saw was in rachis
length and actually the control had the
[SPEAKER_07]: longest rachises, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not exactly sure how to explain it,
but I have a few theories.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this just shows you why I chose
to do shoot diameter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I didn't have the option of doing
shoot length, but technically you can see
[SPEAKER_07]: it throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are testing on two different root
stocks.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you can just look at the trends
here, they are increasing over the season.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this side's shoot diameter,
you can tell it's much more subtle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then shoot length is increasing a
little bit more dramatically, at least
[SPEAKER_07]: between pre bloom and bloom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't find many differences in the
timing of cluster closure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that shoot length would be a
better way to measure shoot vigor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The yield was unchanged.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the rachis differences
probably had something to do with the
[SPEAKER_07]: changes in the plant hormones from the
hedging and the shoot vein.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to acknowledge, I did this research
at Sheldrake Point Winery up in Ovid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the venue manager, Dave Weimann,
was super helpful and cooperative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my advisor, Justine, and Anne and
Sam were her grad students who helped me
[SPEAKER_07]: with my steps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Chris Garland did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Mo Wei Li.
[SPEAKER_09]: And today I'm going to talk about apoptic
expression of the middle-life ENAP
[SPEAKER_09]: methylase, also called DML2 for promoting
food driving.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to give you a brief overview of what
I'm going to talk today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So introduction, previous work,
project, and future work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is a general regulatory network
governing wrapping fruit in tomato.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I'm going to focus today is
female choosing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we treat the tomato plant,
the fruit with methylation inhibitor at 17
[SPEAKER_09]: dpA.
[SPEAKER_09]: DpA means days, posts, and visits.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we can find is the treatment
premature ripening occurred at 30 dpA and
[SPEAKER_09]: while the normal type fruit just mature at
39 dpA and 11 at 42 dpA.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can find that if we inhibit
methylation, it can promote the fruit to
[SPEAKER_09]: ripen a little earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next, there is an average genomic CG
methylation level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we can find is that the blue line
as a green line is fruit at 17 dpA.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is at immature stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also fruit at 65 dpA is at mature
stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So compared with this green line and the
red line, we can see that the CG
[SPEAKER_09]: methylation decreased.
[SPEAKER_09]: That also indicates that during the fruit
ripening stage, the DNA methylation level
[SPEAKER_09]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, DNA de-methylation level
increased.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the future, in our study,
we found that there is a gene called DML2,
[SPEAKER_09]: a meter-like DNA de-methylase that can
achieve such active DNA de-methylation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we knock out the DML2 gene using
CRISPR lines, we can find that the
[SPEAKER_09]: knockout fruit did not ripen.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we can see that in the wild-type
25 dpA, there is a high methylation level,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is in the mature fruit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the wild-type 46 dpA, which is at
the ripening stage, the methylation level
[SPEAKER_09]: is very low.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the DML CRISPR knockout lines,
the methylation level still remains very
[SPEAKER_09]: high and which correlates with the
phenotype we observed.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with the previous work we have done,
we want to ask, what happens when the
[SPEAKER_09]: expression pattern of DML2 is altered?
[SPEAKER_09]: To be more specific, is ectopic expression
of DML2 sufficient to promote ripening in
[SPEAKER_09]: immature?
[SPEAKER_09]: So to prove that, we generate
over-expression lines, but the field,
[SPEAKER_09]: as we can see, that the phenotypes were
very mild.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the degree of over-expression line is
also very low, as we can see here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also we only generate two lines for
the over-expression line.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can see that there is an increase,
but it is very mild and not obvious for
[SPEAKER_09]: the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we want to do is we have two
hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first hypothesis is that the 35S
promoter, DML2 transgene, influences the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: As we know, the 30S promoter can
over-express the DML2 gene to be expressed
[SPEAKER_09]: in the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe the over-expression of DML2 in
the whole plant can do damage to the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to validate the hypothesis,
we generate a fruit-specific DML2
[SPEAKER_09]: over-expression line, basically using
fruit-specific DML2 promoter.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second hypothesis is that the DML2
protein interacts with another protein to
[SPEAKER_09]: facilitate targeting to appropriate load
sign.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the same way to validate the
hypothesis, we use a method to hybrid to
[SPEAKER_09]: find the candidate protein.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the project I'm currently doing
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So rather than doing, instead of doing
protein hybrid screening, we first made a
[SPEAKER_09]: prediction of the candidate protein based
on our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in Arabidopsis, there is a protein
called ROS1, which is a repressor of
[SPEAKER_09]: transcriptional gene silencing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also there's a protein called MAG18,
which is involved in iron-sulfur cluster
[SPEAKER_09]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these two proteins are physically
interacting with each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's another protein called ZRU,
which is a small RNA binding protein.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these two proteins are co-opacting with
each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also know that DML2 protein in
tomato is homologous with ROS1 protein in
[SPEAKER_09]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So based on what we found in Arabidopsis,
we found the homologous with MAG18 in
[SPEAKER_09]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the same way, we found ROS3-like
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want to know, does these proteins
interact with each other?
[SPEAKER_09]: So unfortunately, when we tested the auto
activation of DML2 protein, we found
[SPEAKER_09]: strong auto activation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And further we found that the untimely
part of DML2 shows strong auto activation,
[SPEAKER_09]: as we can see in the picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the blue means there is a strong auto
activation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we can see, the C-terminus shows
white color, which means no auto
[SPEAKER_09]: activation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So later we used just C-terminus part of
DML2 to interact with the candidate
[SPEAKER_09]: protein.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we found is that all of them
shows white color, which indicates that at
[SPEAKER_09]: least C-terminus part of the DML2 protein
does not interact with any of these
[SPEAKER_09]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what other future work we are going to
do is we will finally do library screening
[SPEAKER_09]: to find the candidate protein,
which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we are more focusing on the
fruit-specific overexpiration lines.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're still looking at the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can say that we already saw some
phenotypes, but they are not positive,
[SPEAKER_09]: not that positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: So lastly, thank you all for noticing
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially thank Dan Avinish,
which is my mentor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_17]: So what were the minor phenotypes you'd
like to see?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry?
[SPEAKER_17]: You said there might be some minor
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the gel of the tomato is more liquidy
than the wild type.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fruit, the size is a little
smaller than the wild type.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is just a T0 generation,
so it is variable.
[SPEAKER_17]: No change in ripening time.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like they said, I'm Rachel Anisek.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to switch gears for a minute
and talk to you guys about a peer
[SPEAKER_21]: mentoring program that's relatively new in
the plant science.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in its second year now.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've been a peer mentor for both of
those years.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm really proud to be a part of this
program.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a really challenging transition
time.
[SPEAKER_21]: My first year at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_21]: And so being part of something that makes
it easier for other freshmen to transition
[SPEAKER_21]: is something I'm really passionate about.
[SPEAKER_21]: So just where we're going to go today,
I'm going to talk a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_21]: is peer mentoring?
[SPEAKER_21]: What do we do as peer mentors?
[SPEAKER_21]: What are some of the questions that we get
asked by freshmen?
[SPEAKER_21]: And what is working?
[SPEAKER_21]: And what isn't?
[SPEAKER_21]: A quick little diagnostic.
[SPEAKER_21]: The program is relatively new.
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_21]: So first, what is peer mentoring?
[SPEAKER_21]: We are guides on the side.
[SPEAKER_21]: That is one thing I'll say.
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll say not tutoring, not counselors,
not teachers, not advisors.
[SPEAKER_21]: Freshmen already have professors.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have faculty advisors.
[SPEAKER_21]: Counselors exist here.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have options for all of these things.
[SPEAKER_21]: So there's a lot of things peer mentors
aren't.
[SPEAKER_21]: One thing that I usually describe my role
to my peer mentees when I forget them is
[SPEAKER_21]: that I'm the person that will know who to
ask.
[SPEAKER_21]: They have all of these resources available
to them.
[SPEAKER_21]: But it can be a bit overwhelming to try
and figure out who do I ask about
[SPEAKER_21]: pre-enroll?
[SPEAKER_21]: Who do I ask about these kinds of
questions?
[SPEAKER_21]: I have RAs and advisors and so many
wonderful resources.
[SPEAKER_21]: They can ask me.
[SPEAKER_21]: If I don't have the answer, I can tell
them who to ask.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's generally how I explain my role
to them.
[SPEAKER_21]: The other thing that I like to describe it
as is just helping them while their
[SPEAKER_21]: support structure reorganizes.
[SPEAKER_21]: They're really far away from their family
most of the time, maybe in drastically
[SPEAKER_21]: different time zones.
[SPEAKER_21]: Likely none of their friends are here.
[SPEAKER_21]: So while they're in that first transition
period of that first couple of months
[SPEAKER_21]: where they're making friends, interacting
with professors, getting to know faculty
[SPEAKER_21]: and meeting their advisors, they need to
have somebody who is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_21]: stable who is always there.
[SPEAKER_21]: So we meet them at orientation and can
follow them through that process.
[SPEAKER_21]: The last thing that I will say about peer
mentoring also, it is confidential.
[SPEAKER_21]: We spend a lot of time talking with our
mentees about what confidentiality means
[SPEAKER_21]: to them.
[SPEAKER_21]: What do they want me to share with other
mentees that I have or other folks in
[SPEAKER_21]: their groups?
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes that is nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes that is, yeah, if someone else
is having similar challenges, you can tell
[SPEAKER_21]: them about it and maybe then connect those
two mentees and they could have a better
[SPEAKER_21]: time working together.
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what does that actually look like?
[SPEAKER_21]: What do we end up doing?
[SPEAKER_21]: So we meet with mentees usually every two
to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_21]: We can meet in groups or sometimes in
individualized meetings.
[SPEAKER_21]: I usually like to start with a big group
meeting.
[SPEAKER_21]: So not only that they can meet me,
but they can start meeting and socializing
[SPEAKER_21]: with other plant science freshmen.
[SPEAKER_21]: One of my favorite things to do that I've
done a couple times now is just bring a
[SPEAKER_21]: bunch of them to the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really hard to get mentees off
campus.
[SPEAKER_21]: So as a freshman, being able to go and see
more of what I think it has to offer is
[SPEAKER_21]: really fun.
[SPEAKER_21]: They usually progress into individual
meetings later in the semester as people
[SPEAKER_21]: have more specific questions and maybe
they don't want to share everything with
[SPEAKER_21]: everyone in the group.
[SPEAKER_21]: What do I do to start?
[SPEAKER_21]: Usually just provide information about a
whole host of resources.
[SPEAKER_21]: Freshmen have passion center events.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a learning strategy center.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's empathy assistance and referral
services, which is known as EARS,
[SPEAKER_21]: which is a peer counseling service on
campus that can be less intimidating if a
[SPEAKER_21]: student wants to get into counseling,
but that can be a really big word for some
[SPEAKER_21]: people.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll oftentimes suggest this first and
said, or they can go straight to the
[SPEAKER_21]: counseling and psychological services,
calling it caps here from now on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Other things we do is mostly just being
present, responding promptly, making sure
[SPEAKER_21]: that you're meeting specific individual
needs of students and paying attention to
[SPEAKER_21]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_21]: Everyone on a very individual scale.
[SPEAKER_21]: Other things we do, we consistently meet
with the other mentors and with our
[SPEAKER_21]: wonderful facilitators to make sure that
we're sharing experiences with one
[SPEAKER_21]: another.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes mentors will come in,
especially as the program is so new,
[SPEAKER_21]: and say, I got this question.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no clue what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can share our experiences or try
and figure out some of our own biases or
[SPEAKER_21]: our own experiences about the program.
[SPEAKER_21]: Here's just a little splash of some of the
questions that we get asked as peer
[SPEAKER_21]: mentors.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a couple that I like putting up
here because sometimes I like to share
[SPEAKER_21]: what specifically we do that is different
than faculty advisors.
[SPEAKER_21]: There are some things up here.
[SPEAKER_21]: I've gotten questions anywhere from,
what kind of coat do I need for the Ithaca
[SPEAKER_21]: winter?
[SPEAKER_21]: How bad is it?
[SPEAKER_21]: To, I need help practicing my
conversational English.
[SPEAKER_21]: So trying to look at all of those things
and some things that maybe students are a
[SPEAKER_21]: bit embarrassed to talk to their faculty
advisors about, or maybe their RA is in
[SPEAKER_21]: charge of 100 other students.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's something that we can help with as
well.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've just highlighted three points that
I want to talk about for a minute.
[SPEAKER_21]: Homesickness.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's something that we pay attention to
a lot when we structure our groups.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a couple mentees from similar
regions share missing large landscapes,
[SPEAKER_21]: missing mountains, which I know is
something that I really related to coming
[SPEAKER_21]: from New England and just missing the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's something that while my faculty
advisor is a wonderful human being,
[SPEAKER_21]: I would have definitely told him now had
it happened to me at this point in my
[SPEAKER_21]: Cornell career and when I knew him,
I would not have told him in my first
[SPEAKER_21]: three weeks of being 18 in a new place.
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something that we pay attention
to so that they can talk to each other
[SPEAKER_21]: about it, but also us and to know that
that's something that is normal and
[SPEAKER_21]: healthy and very common.
[SPEAKER_21]: Another one I'd like to highlight is what
I affectionately call the misery Olympics.
[SPEAKER_21]: This is something that I'm not sure how
aware all faculty are about it,
[SPEAKER_21]: but there tends to be a little bit of a
one-up mentality at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're talking to your friends.
[SPEAKER_21]: You had a hard time.
[SPEAKER_21]: You're saying, oh, I had all these things
due today and I only got like five hours
[SPEAKER_21]: of sleep.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_21]: Your friend looks at you and they say,
well, I only got three hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a bigger exam that I have to do
today on that forefront dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And no one really comes out of that
interaction feeling better.
[SPEAKER_21]: So sometimes I get students who don't
really know how to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's something that as a mentor,
I still don't really know how to deal with
[SPEAKER_21]: it.
[SPEAKER_21]: So trying to talk to people about
transition to Cornell culture and trying
[SPEAKER_21]: to fight back against the misery Olympics
a bit and just have that compassion for
[SPEAKER_21]: your fellow students instead of trying to
one-up each other on that forefront.
[SPEAKER_21]: But what happens if it does happen around
you?
[SPEAKER_21]: How do you navigate that as you're trying
to transition to a new place and figure
[SPEAKER_21]: out what kind of people you want to be
around?
[SPEAKER_21]: The last thing I'm going to throw up here,
questions about partying and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely would have talked to staff or
faculty about this one.
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know about anyone else when they
were 18, but it's something that your RA
[SPEAKER_21]: is supposed to be really useful with.
[SPEAKER_21]: But sometimes RAs are in charge of a lot
of people at once.
[SPEAKER_21]: You have to be in a bit more crisis mode.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have between three and five mentees at
any given time.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a little bit more open.
[SPEAKER_21]: They can talk to each other a little bit
more free.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's something that I like to slush up
here because they're not talking to their
[SPEAKER_21]: faculty advisors about it.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if they're not talking to their RAs
about it, if they're not talking to your
[SPEAKER_21]: mentor about it, then it's just a bunch of
18-year-olds talking to each other about
[SPEAKER_21]: it, which is something I think we would
all like to avoid and try and figure out
[SPEAKER_21]: so that everyone can feel a little bit
safer, including our freshmen.
[SPEAKER_21]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_21]: So what's working so far?
[SPEAKER_21]: There are a couple things that I really am
proud of in this program.
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a big focus on it being
individual and really holistic,
[SPEAKER_21]: looking at a whole person sitting in front
of you and talking to them as they are.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's really useful.
[SPEAKER_21]: We also right now have a really small and
dedicated team of mentors.
[SPEAKER_21]: So each mentor having between three and
five mentees as opposed to a one-on-one
[SPEAKER_21]: relationship can be really useful.
[SPEAKER_21]: It means that the mentors can actually all
get together and diagnose what's going on
[SPEAKER_21]: in the program.
[SPEAKER_21]: And I really appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it makes a big difference as
opposed to maybe having a couple of
[SPEAKER_21]: mentors who are a little bit packed out.
[SPEAKER_21]: We also got ears training.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mentioned that peer counseling service
at the beginning of the talk.
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was really useful for me to figure
out active listening, asking better
[SPEAKER_21]: questions of my mentees to figure out what
was going on and diagnosing it.
[SPEAKER_21]: I had a couple instances where all of a
sudden, prelims started coming around.
[SPEAKER_21]: And every single person had problems with
their roommates, all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_21]: And that didn't actually seem to be the
problem once you started to get people
[SPEAKER_21]: talking about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I would have known how to do that with
the training.
[SPEAKER_21]: Another thing that is really important,
especially at the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_21]: program, is just being flexible,
being flexible with your time,
[SPEAKER_21]: with your schedule, but also knowing that
there isn't the strictest of structure
[SPEAKER_21]: yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: So as we're figuring it out, trying to
figure out what works best.
[SPEAKER_21]: And a nice relaxed and reflective
atmosphere as opposed to another
[SPEAKER_21]: worksheet, another class that they have to
do, another obligation for them.
[SPEAKER_21]: Something that is supposed to be more
about growth as a person than ensuring
[SPEAKER_21]: academic success at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_21]: So some challenges that we have moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_21]: From a peer mentor's perspective,
it can be really hard not to be
[SPEAKER_21]: prescriptive in your approach.
[SPEAKER_21]: Something that I was challenged with is
making sure that you look at your mentee
[SPEAKER_21]: and you see your mentee instead of seeing
yourself at 18.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's something that we pay a lot of
attention to prevent and try and figure
[SPEAKER_21]: out if that is happening over the course
of it.
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's something that anyone thinking
about becoming a mentor is something
[SPEAKER_21]: really useful to think about beforehand.
[SPEAKER_21]: From the structure of the program,
we've been having a hard time dealing with
[SPEAKER_21]: no shows.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes someone doesn't show up because
they don't want to be nagged and they
[SPEAKER_21]: don't need the help and they're feeling
like they're set to go.
[SPEAKER_21]: And sometimes someone doesn't show up
because they don't know how to ask for the
[SPEAKER_21]: help.
[SPEAKER_21]: And those who look really similar on the
face, we're not totally sure how to deal
[SPEAKER_21]: with that yet.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's something we're in the process of.
[SPEAKER_21]: We're also not totally sure at the
beginning of this program yet how much of
[SPEAKER_21]: a requirement it should be.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes the people who need the program
the most won't do it unless you require
[SPEAKER_21]: them.
[SPEAKER_21]: But at the same time, that adds a layer of
formality to the program that is
[SPEAKER_21]: beneficial to not have, from my
perspective, in a really informal
[SPEAKER_21]: peer-to-peer sense.
[SPEAKER_21]: And then from the structure of SIPs and
PALs and the university, kind of bigger
[SPEAKER_21]: things that we can deal with at this time,
there are not too many times that they can
[SPEAKER_21]: take really strong courses their first
year.
[SPEAKER_21]: And some of my freshmen found that really
demotivating.
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's something that we needed to be
aware of and that I know SIPs care really
[SPEAKER_21]: deeply about.
[SPEAKER_21]: So the other reason I mentioned it is just
so that we can be aware of it because I
[SPEAKER_21]: know it's in the process of changing.
[SPEAKER_21]: And there are sometimes challenges with
long-term mental health conditions
[SPEAKER_21]: surfacing once you get to Cornell and it
being treated more as an acute crisis than
[SPEAKER_21]: something that needs long-term care.
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is something that, again,
I know the university cares really deeply
[SPEAKER_21]: about and I bring it up because,
well, it's not something that peer mentors
[SPEAKER_21]: can make the most top-down changes from.
[SPEAKER_21]: We can definitely make a change or
recognize or be aware of where the
[SPEAKER_21]: problems are and when someone comes to us
with this.
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to acknowledge Marcia and Sheebly
and Gregory Peck, our wonderful
[SPEAKER_21]: facilitators who put the program together.
[SPEAKER_21]: All of our Plant Science peer mentors,
including the new ones who are coming this
[SPEAKER_21]: year, and the first year as a peer mentees
for being a bit of a guinea pig and
[SPEAKER_21]: bearing with us while we try to figure
this out.
[SPEAKER_21]: I would love to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you talked a lot, a little bit
about an overlap between RAs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was wondering if there's any existing
collaboration with the residential and new
[SPEAKER_07]: student programs.
[SPEAKER_21]: There is not, but that is something we can
definitely look into.
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_17]: There's one right here.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that making sure that just that
they know when they can access it right
[SPEAKER_21]: now, there is obviously a beautiful set of
building blocks towards your junior level
[SPEAKER_21]: plant courses that works really well with
the new curriculum.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know a lot of us here were the first
year with the new curriculum for the Plant
[SPEAKER_21]: Science courses.
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's just making sure that they
can dive into the Plant Science,
[SPEAKER_21]: even if not their first semester here,
second semester here, which I know a lot
[SPEAKER_21]: of them do get to.
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes it's just something that has to,
they have to actively think about a lot
[SPEAKER_21]: more, or I know students that bring in AP
credits sometimes can benefit a lot more
[SPEAKER_21]: from it because maybe they can skip that
second writing seminar or things like that
[SPEAKER_21]: and they have more space.
[SPEAKER_21]: That is a wonderful question.
[SPEAKER_21]: I am always more, I am always pro
flexibility, just kind of as a rule,
[SPEAKER_21]: as a person.
[SPEAKER_21]: But I also am not going to say I'm an
expert on the Plant Science curriculum.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it's been through a lot of
iterations and I really appreciate the
[SPEAKER_21]: history of it going forward.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Rachel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Hanna, like Mike said,
and I'm a double major in Plant Science
[SPEAKER_06]: and International Agriculture and Rural
Development.
[SPEAKER_06]: This past summer, I was a Cal's Global
Fellow with the Tata Cornell Institute for
[SPEAKER_06]: Agriculture and Nutrition.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tata Cornell Institute is a research
institute that's based here on campus
[SPEAKER_06]: across the Ag Quad and Warren Hall,
also with offices in Delhi and Mumbai and
[SPEAKER_06]: in satellite offices all around rural
India.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was working on one of their projects
with the Orange Flush Sweet Potato,
[SPEAKER_06]: OFSP.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent some of there and that's all I'm
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for a quick overview, I was assigned
to the ONUP project, which is OFSP for
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrition at Uttar Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were implementing the Orange Flush
Sweet Potato for the first time as a
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrition intervention in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today, I'm going to give you a general
project overview, my little section of
[SPEAKER_06]: this broad project that I was on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to talk about the interviews
that I conducted, a ripple effects mapping
[SPEAKER_06]: session that I did with my team there,
some takeaways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, takeaways is missing an E.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some personal growth from this internship
experience, and then I can pick any of
[SPEAKER_06]: your questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: ONUP, as I mentioned before, is a
nutrition intervention project.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Orange Flush Sweet Potato is a
beta-carotene vitamin A rich crop that can
[SPEAKER_06]: be vegetated with propagated.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really exciting and has been
introduced in large parts of Eastern
[SPEAKER_06]: Africa with really great success for me as
a nutrition intervention.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this part of India, about 95 percent of
pregnant women are vitamin A deficient and
[SPEAKER_06]: over 53 percent of kids are vitamin A
deficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vitamin A is a really important nutrient
for these populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a research institute, the Papua Plano
Institute has set up an experiment where
[SPEAKER_06]: there are 10 agriculture intervention
villages.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of these villages receive vines and
extension supports.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get to share vines with each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some farmer field tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some farmers that I was working
with and they're sharing vines with their
[SPEAKER_06]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of those 10 villages, then there are five
that also receive nutrition interventions.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of promotion of the Orange Flush
Sweet Potato in the form of cooking
[SPEAKER_06]: classes, talking about men's events.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some really interesting gender
dynamics in India of who gets to eat first
[SPEAKER_06]: and how that affects nutrition outcomes,
and then a lot of promotion of hygienic
[SPEAKER_06]: practices as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking to see if those nutrition
interventions specifically have outcomes
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of nutritional impacts in these
populations.
[SPEAKER_06]: My part of this big multi-year project
that's still actually going on is that I
[SPEAKER_06]: was looking at for a qualitative analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been looking here on campus,
but I've been able to participate in a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of plant science lab-based research on
campus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was seeking a broader qualitative
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was conducting interviews and speaking
with team members about why farmers choose
[SPEAKER_06]: to adopt a new crop and how they view that
crop impact in their communities and how
[SPEAKER_06]: they communicate with other farmers around
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is super important
because I think agriculture extension is
[SPEAKER_06]: super important and it can be improved in
a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of money for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Improving how farmers can communicate with
each other, understanding how they already
[SPEAKER_06]: communicate with each other and how
extension can make use of those
[SPEAKER_06]: communication networks can help improve
the extension that's already happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps reduce spending on extension and
continue to put that spending towards more
[SPEAKER_06]: important things or expand extension
already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fundamentally, if we're doing better
extension and expanding the work that's
[SPEAKER_06]: being done in these areas, it'll lead to
improved nutrition outcomes and improving
[SPEAKER_06]: quality of life for lots of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first part of my project was conducting
informant interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: Informant interviews are not census
interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're usually a number of people that
are identified as important people in the
[SPEAKER_06]: story of certain projects.
[SPEAKER_06]: I conducted 22 interviews and they were
all identified by the agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: extension agents that I was working with
because I was only there for summer,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they were working with these farmers
for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew better who to talk to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I conducted those interviews with a
translator because I don't speak poetry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He spoke a little bit of English and then
I would actually record the interviews and
[SPEAKER_06]: transcribe them later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked them a lot of questions about why
they choose to adopt different things,
[SPEAKER_06]: how they imagined this crop and the new
potatoes influencing their family and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they like best, and a lot of laughter and
fun times with these farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm learning a lot about their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the faces of a number of the
people that I interviewed.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the pictures in this presentation I
was able to take on the ground there.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was most important is that a lot of
these projects, you talk about nutrition
[SPEAKER_06]: intervention villages and take a number of
steps away, but fundamentally on the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground, it's influencing people's real
lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talking to them, female farmers whose
husbands were working in the city for most
[SPEAKER_06]: of the year, or male farmers who are
feeding 12 kids, it was really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really exciting to get to talk to real
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another aspect of my qualitative analysis
was the ripple effects mapping session.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not something I planned to do when
I first set out on the internship,
[SPEAKER_06]: but every day when I would come back,
me and the team would be sitting in this
[SPEAKER_06]: room and it'd be hot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be telling these amazing stories
about what they were doing in the field
[SPEAKER_06]: and all the different things that were
happening, but none of it was being caught
[SPEAKER_06]: up in the metrics that they were taking.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were taking surveys where they were
catching a lot of numbers, but none of
[SPEAKER_06]: these stories were being captured in the
work that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to do a ripple effects mapping.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was lucky enough to participate in a
ripple effects mapping session here on
[SPEAKER_06]: campus following some work that I did with
Cornell Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a little bit of experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's a way of capturing
unexpected outcomes in a project by
[SPEAKER_06]: telling stories and following those
stories and keeping track of how those
[SPEAKER_06]: stories lead to outcomes and then tracking
those overall.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see on that board behind me,
I had a blast with a whiteboard marker.
[SPEAKER_06]: My team was really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of these folks only speak Bojpuri.
[SPEAKER_06]: Silke, the woman in the green shirt there,
she was my translator.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really interesting time,
half in English, half in Bojpuri,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they'd tell stories to each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really, really great day.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a super overwhelming picture of
that whiteboard drawing that I then put
[SPEAKER_06]: into a computer program.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I did then is I did a color coding.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see here a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a really small text.
[SPEAKER_06]: In most development projects, there's
what's called a theory of change model.
[SPEAKER_06]: A theory of change model is that you
establish before you start your work and
[SPEAKER_06]: there are certain indicators.
[SPEAKER_06]: While there were unexpected outcomes,
what was super exciting about this is that
[SPEAKER_06]: by tracking the stories, we were also able
to see these red triangles are expected
[SPEAKER_06]: outcomes and indicators.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the theory of change model that was
proposed when this project started,
[SPEAKER_06]: the ripple effects map also found some of
those indicators were met as well,
[SPEAKER_06]: but through a different way of tracking
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: My main takeaways from this project and
from what I was able to gather from this
[SPEAKER_06]: project is that farmers rely heavily on
personal networks, especially in this
[SPEAKER_06]: region of India.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really aware of who the best
farmer is in their region and they know
[SPEAKER_06]: even if they're growing eggplant,
who they'll talk to.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really important for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, farmers were inspired by their
peers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We joked about OFSP going viral.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot of farmers being jealous
of each other's potatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucky for them, they could just share
vines.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a very, very successful project.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited to see the data from
later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's strong nutrition messaging,
but mostly people just like to eat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_06]: It tastes really delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet potatoes aren't super common in
Indian cuisine, so people were super
[SPEAKER_06]: excited to try something new and kids
really like it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super exciting and really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I mentioned just previously,
there are some successes with medium
[SPEAKER_06]: theory of change indicators, which is
super important for a project that's
[SPEAKER_06]: getting a lot of funding and super
important for the project moving forward
[SPEAKER_06]: and so exciting for Katie, who is the PhD
student that I was working under.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the nutrition and agriculture
interventions in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times in villages where there
were these OFSP cooking competitions and
[SPEAKER_06]: other things like that, they were working
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: The extension agents, they were a group of
ag extension agents and a group of
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrition extension agents, but their work
was building upon each other and that was
[SPEAKER_06]: really exciting to see as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, I had a really great time as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some amazing qualitative
research skills that I was able to gain
[SPEAKER_06]: through this experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned how to code interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned how to conduct interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned how to be really patient when
things weren't going my way with
[SPEAKER_06]: interviews.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really helped me gain a broader global
context for the work that I hope to do in
[SPEAKER_06]: the future with nutrition.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also helped me understand more about
plant breathing and take some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: classes that I had taken here at Cornell
and put them into a broader context.
[SPEAKER_06]: It generally helped my passion for food
systems continue to grow and really
[SPEAKER_06]: broaden my experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd really like to thank the Cornell
Institute for sending me to India and
[SPEAKER_06]: testing me with this experience to Katie
Merkel, the woman up here, for bringing
[SPEAKER_06]: out her project.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the whole Greening Development
Services team that took me out into the
[SPEAKER_06]: field every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is, were you able to document
reductions in villages that had
[SPEAKER_03]: intervention?
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, what was the biggest barrier to
adoption in villages that might know about
[SPEAKER_03]: it but not use it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Katie has a whole team of surveyors that
are weighing children and keeping track of
[SPEAKER_06]: them over the course of five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's a lot of data there.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was there, we were in our first
year with farmers getting each other
[SPEAKER_06]: vines.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second year, so still pretty early.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot more people eating OFSP
than there were before.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's really special about OFSP that I
did mention is that in that part of India,
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the vitamin A comes from mango
trees.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mangoes come short-grown season whereas
this can be grown in all three Indian
[SPEAKER_06]: growing seasons, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your second question was about?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you perceive to be the biggest
barrier to adoption?
[SPEAKER_06]: He mentioned about barriers to adoption.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I think is that most people didn't
know how to cook it, so that's why those
[SPEAKER_06]: cooking classes are really helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you eat it raw, it doesn't have as much
vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were really trying to communicate with
people that their kids might munch on it
[SPEAKER_06]: raw, but they're not going to get as much
from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was super surprised because you hear
about a lot of resistance to adoption of
[SPEAKER_06]: new crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a personal theory, but I think
because there is already some sweet potato
[SPEAKER_06]: in Indian cuisine, but not a lot,
this just seems like something new,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they are at least a little bit
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I perceived.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Garrett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am concentrating in plant breeding and
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm going to talk to you about my
work in a plant pathology lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start off, just a broad overview,
a big picture to orient ourselves and to
[SPEAKER_00]: get just a bit of an overview of the
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like plant pathology to start
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost didn't like it as much as oral
presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, this is my past tense and my
viewpoint on plant pathology has changed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit over this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played two major roles in this
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the role of a plant doctor,
which is a bit of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was less of being a doctor and more
like a mortician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of trying to help plants,
I was more of seeing why they were dead
[SPEAKER_00]: and dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to read any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are not humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you aren't plant pathologists or
plant scientists, or maybe you had a rough
[SPEAKER_00]: day at Slope Day yesterday, plants are not
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant diseases are not like human
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terminology related to plant diseases
is not the same as that related to human
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward with that, in this next
slide, the two bacteria that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: working on were Dickeyia and
Pectobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bacteria are similar in that they
often co-occur and they have a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: method of action within plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit different is that Dickeyia
has a wide host range while Pectobacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: is a little bit more narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both, in plant pathology terms,
they cause the same disease, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause the same diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say that Pectobacteria and Dickeyia
both cause black leg and soft rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is that, sorry,
black leg disease is when these bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: are found in the vascular tissue in the
stem, where soft rot, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the tuber and they make it soft and wet
and terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is due to a pectin degrading enzyme
that these bacteria produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is important because it
can impact yield and production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's important to note on this
previous slide, I included images where
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are showing symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note that these bacteria
can be asymptomatic in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really problematic for the seed
tuber industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that doesn't look like
it has a disease and you move it to an
[SPEAKER_00]: area where there isn't a disease,
now that area is going to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, which is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking for resistance in
potatoes, it may help inform us about
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to these, at least for Dickeyia
and other solanaceous crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: My role as a plant doctor, we started off
by isolating the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have potatoes sent to us from
around New York, and we would look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and try to take areas of the plant
that we knew that we were hoping that
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't take areas that are completely
necrotic, as those would probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: other opportunistic infections and the
causal agent, but not it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd take areas that look slightly more
healthy, but they probably have the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would then culture the bacteria in
those areas and we would plate the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would plate it on these agar plates
that also contain pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, these bacteria
produce a pectin degrading enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this means is that the plates that
contain pectin will form pits where the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial colonies of at least
Pectobacteria and Dickeyia, when those
[SPEAKER_00]: pits will form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a quick diagnostic way to see,
oh, this probably is Dickeyia or
[SPEAKER_00]: Pectobacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can do DNA extraction,
PCR, and sequencing, and all that good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, the role of a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculated the potatoes and we then
incubated them for 24 hours and we
[SPEAKER_00]: measured the soft rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be going through some images
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The images are from two years ago in a
slightly different iteration of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just mention the small differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just when we were creating a site
for the inoculation, just creating a small
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in the tuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would then inoculate it with Dickeyia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then seal it up using either food grade
wax or parafilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would then incubate the potatoes
overnight for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would keep them in a hot, dark,
humid area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, we would cut all the
potatoes and lay them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit different because
these are a bunch of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was working with was only Solanum
microdontum, which is not table potatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it showed in the previous iteration
that it had a bit of a higher resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: to Dickeyia.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, here's some of the images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is one image.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's well and good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see too much soft rot in these,
but there was also a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also had images like this,
where the soft rot is very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we would do is we would measure the
width of the soft rot in the potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help quantify the amount of
resistance that these potatoes have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I gained from this experience,
I learned general lab techniques,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least practiced them with DNA
extraction, PCR alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I learned some things specific to
plant pathology, whether it was isolating
[SPEAKER_00]: a disease or plating bacteria,
stuff that I hadn't had too much practice
[SPEAKER_00]: with in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very informative to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I gained an appreciation for plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say now, I have no dislike to plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward, what's going to be
happening next, it will be working on
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to incorporate this natural
resistance from Solanum microdontum into
[SPEAKER_00]: Solanum tuberosa on table potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Dr. Brian Swingle and Dr. Ma
Jing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really mentored me over the course of
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in the lab was super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stole a bunch of my photos from Lily
Loft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_13]: How bad did those experiments smell?
[SPEAKER_13]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Zhe Ding, which goes by Maggie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, I'm going to talk about my research
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because my current project just
recently started moving on again,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I'm firstly going to introduce about my
previous formal research experience before
[SPEAKER_07]: I transfer here at Cornell, that is
actually about drug polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's start with some background
information about this drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a corresponding disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all sleep at night and wake during
the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It matches the daily patterns of sunlight
and darkness, which reflect the terms,
[SPEAKER_07]: like the circadianism.
[SPEAKER_07]: For plant-side students, we are all
somehow familiar with circadianism because
[SPEAKER_07]: we know the typical sunflower's
heliotrophism behavior or some plant
[SPEAKER_07]: secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this disease is actually a
circadian disorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is called non-24-hour sleep wake
disorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it means that your clock is not
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be 20 hours or 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't really sleep well at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this drug, the Tux Middle, is actually
for the treatment of such disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is targeted at the melatonin
receptors, MT1 and MT2.
[SPEAKER_07]: By taking this drug, the page experience
are very dramatically improved in their
[SPEAKER_07]: sleeping qualities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So oh, I forgot this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the disease, actually 70% of the
disease happens in blind people,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it can also affect sighted people as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this drug is firstly approved in
generally 2014 by FDA and later in
[SPEAKER_07]: European countries, but only for the
treatment of the disease in blind people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are polymorphisms and why should
we care about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: So polymorphism can be categorized into
three different categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are either polymorphous solubate and
amorphous forms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for polymorphism, it refers to the
difference in the molecular packing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the solvates, it's a difference
due to hydration or solvations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is it important?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because scientists have found that
polymorphism can not only impact on the
[SPEAKER_07]: chemical physical properties, but also
influence its biological behavior,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially for drugs, such as its
intrinsic dissolution rate or its
[SPEAKER_07]: biodiversity availability.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so because there's no previous studies
about the drug polymorphism in
[SPEAKER_07]: Talsimidome, so in this project,
one graduate student, Kai Hang,
[SPEAKER_07]: actually observed two different crystal
forms in Talsimidome, and they are type 1
[SPEAKER_07]: and type 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is i-hazard and one is i-hazard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here it's just a 2D dimension of
showing the basic molecular structures of
[SPEAKER_07]: Talsimidome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is the outcome step, like labeled
with skin to show the difference between
[SPEAKER_07]: type 1 and type 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you can see that the reason is
different, because type 2 has a water
[SPEAKER_07]: molecule here binding these two molecules
together, which makes it a hemihybrid
[SPEAKER_07]: form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do different kind of tasks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that task if there's any chemical or
physical difference between these two
[SPEAKER_07]: types of crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is just a UV fluorescence image
of type 1 and type 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you can see that these two crystal
forms are very morphologically different,
[SPEAKER_07]: because type 1 is more like a rock shape,
whereas type 2 is like a surface shape.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also do the scanning electron
microscope, showing the surface of the
[SPEAKER_07]: crystals, which show the similar results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we look at the outer stacking layer
of these two crystal forms, it can
[SPEAKER_07]: actually make sense for its morphological
characteristics, because type 1 is more
[SPEAKER_07]: like one-dimensional linear shape,
whereas type 2 is two-dimensional and
[SPEAKER_07]: forming a surface.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do far more than this, but right now
I'm going to move on to its biological
[SPEAKER_07]: characteristic focused from a drop
perspective, I mean.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first thing we do is try to do an
intrinsic dissolution study.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is actually the result we find.
[SPEAKER_07]: For intrinsic dissolution, it means we put
the crystal into the solution and do not
[SPEAKER_07]: disturb it at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So from here, you can see the right well
is always much higher.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the slope is much higher than the
blue line, which means type 2 is like the
[SPEAKER_07]: intrinsic dissolution rate is almost
two-fold higher than type 1.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, if you compare figure A and
figure B here, you can see that both type
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 and type 2 suggest higher rates in a
more acidic environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, the pH is much acidic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do not only test about its
intrinsic dissolution, but also we do want
[SPEAKER_07]: to know if this got different forms of
more toxic than others.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do MTT cell proliferation assay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it means that you want to
measure how many alive cells within each
[SPEAKER_07]: well under the same concentration.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more purple the color you see
here, it indicates that over a certain
[SPEAKER_07]: time, the more alive cells within each
well you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the results suggest that both type 1
and type 2 are still within the safety
[SPEAKER_07]: range from a drop perspective at several
levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: But type 2 is likely more toxic than type
1.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to further verify the test result,
we feed the mice with the drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do the HPLC analysis for the
verification.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is what we found.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do the HPL analysis at all the
levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we find that this drug, after all of
those two hours, it mainly accumulates in
[SPEAKER_07]: this poor part of all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you cannot really find it in hearts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here is the concentration time curve
right over here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see both type 1 and type 2 are
like the maximum concentration are not
[SPEAKER_13]: significantly different.
[SPEAKER_13]: But type 1 is slightly, if so,
higher than type 2.
[SPEAKER_13]: But more importantly, type 1 has longer
retention time compared with type 2,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is very important as a drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to further verify if there is any organ
damage, we do the liver and kidney damage
[SPEAKER_13]: test here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are three experimental groups in
different colors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell type 1, type 2, and PBS as control
groups.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of my acronyms are reflecting the
compounds or the compounds ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Suggesting if there is any organ liver or
kidney damage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from here, you can see because there's
no significant difference between those
[SPEAKER_07]: three color bars.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is also no significant damage at
all levels between type 1 and type 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to wrap up, in this project,
we find two different crystal forms,
[SPEAKER_07]: type 1 and type 2.
[SPEAKER_07]: And observe they have different physical,
chemical, and biological properties
[SPEAKER_07]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Type 2 has a higher intrinsic dissolution
rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas type 1 has slightly higher maximum
concentration in the individual
[SPEAKER_07]: environment and much more longer retention
times, which leads to a certain point that
[SPEAKER_07]: the individual environment is much more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because those forms suggest more
toxicities at stellar and organ levels,
[SPEAKER_07]: so type 1 with longer retention times may
be a better drug form for pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_07]: companies for making those drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but not least, I just want to briefly
introduce about my current project of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Lareya plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Lareya plant is actually a genus
developed to zygoplasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is native to the American continent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are five species within this
genus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lareya tridentata is the only species
found in the United States, whereas the
[SPEAKER_07]: rest were all found in South America.
[SPEAKER_13]: And among them, Lareya cuneifolia is the
only petrified species among them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have different leaf morphological
characteristic differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Professor Nixon actually find there is
a clone in South America.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all these four species actually appear
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So more importantly, there is also a clone
right over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are trying to know the
identification of this clone through
[SPEAKER_07]: testing their, like, building the matrix,
phylogeny, and also the evolutionary
[SPEAKER_07]: studies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also want to know their polyphoid
levels, because they're diploid type of
[SPEAKER_07]: place, which they call a triploid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would really thank Professor Tong
and Professor Nixon for offering me the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity to walk in their labs,
and Kai Hang and Danela for teaching me
[SPEAKER_07]: all the techniques I required to do to run
the experiments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this two research experience really
teach me a lot and really taught me what I
[SPEAKER_07]: want to do in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I want to thank all the class
members here, Chris and Mike, for offering
[SPEAKER_07]: me the feedback of the entire
presentation, and also students and staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to talk about the research I
did this summer at Rekirahua Orchard in
[SPEAKER_07]: Maine, which is where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a background, if you didn't know,
I really like apples.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've worked with apples for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is my first experience really
getting to work in a large scale
[SPEAKER_07]: commercial orchard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything I've done before was small
scale, or here at Cornell Orchards and
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of doing research.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was a great opportunity to really
test my abilities and to apply all the
[SPEAKER_07]: theory that I've learned in classes to the
real world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was an unstructured internship.
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't really even an internship.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just I went up to the owner of the
orchard, and I was like, hey, I want a
[SPEAKER_10]: job.
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was like, OK, you got one.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just kind of did my thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of the time, I did a bunch of
general orchard tasks that you would have
[SPEAKER_10]: to do throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did a lot of scouting, both in
orchards and in the cranberry box.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked for pests, diseases,
disorders, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a picture of what I thought was
a really badly named apple tree.
[SPEAKER_10]: And turns out it was just ear damage,
which is a factor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the cranberry box that I tested
in.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also helped trellis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Trellis young trees, because they need
support when they're young.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I helped graft, which if you
don't know, is when you put a variety that
[SPEAKER_03]: you want, like a Red Delicious onto a root
stock, because you can't just plant an
[SPEAKER_03]: apple seed and make a tree that you
wouldn't eat from that, because they
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't treated tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also planted pumpkin seeds, and I've
sorted watermelons up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because typically, in a medium scale,
large scale orchard, you have to do
[SPEAKER_10]: anything that you can to earn money.
[SPEAKER_10]: So here, they would buy rejected
watermelons from Walmart and other big box
[SPEAKER_10]: stores, sort through them, find the good
ones, and sell them back.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did that for a day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also weeded water in the road and found
out I can't drive a tractor in a straight
[SPEAKER_10]: line.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also did a lot with installing and
fixing irrigation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also spent a whole day picking
up rocks, which was the most awful day of
[SPEAKER_10]: my life, honestly.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a saying in Maine where we don't
grow food, we just grow rocks.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you clear a field the next
year, more rocks will disappear.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I spent a day doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the most mentally toxic thing I've
ever done.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything else, I love.
[SPEAKER_10]: I loved about this job.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also did too many projects, so I worked
on precision thinning.
[SPEAKER_10]: So apples tend to over-crop a lot,
especially if they're on their on-year,
[SPEAKER_10]: because a lot of them are biannual.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to go through and thin them so
that the apples, A, don't tip over from
[SPEAKER_10]: the weight of the apple, and B,
produce apples that are larger in size.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I went through and took measurements of
all the apples when they were pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: small.
[SPEAKER_10]: To determine how fast they were growing,
and whether or not they would self thin,
[SPEAKER_10]: or we had to apply chemical thinners to
them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also helped create some scouting
records for various food safety protocols
[SPEAKER_07]: they were involved in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I also learned how to spray pesticides.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was probably one of my most
exciting tasks for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first weekend that I was there,
I woke up at 6 a.m., drove to the orchard,
[SPEAKER_10]: and learned how to drive a tractor,
and learned how to spray all of my
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a picture of me that first day on
my tractor, which we affectionately call
[SPEAKER_07]: Mutt.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is four different tractors from the
80s that have been pieced together into
[SPEAKER_07]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a picture of the back of the
tractor in my little one-acre orchard that
[SPEAKER_07]: I was spraying.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sprayed both conventional and organic
spray programs.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I used when I was spraying
organic, just because you need different
[SPEAKER_10]: machinery, because you can't contaminate
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I learned how to make tink mixes
and pour in the right amount of chemicals,
[SPEAKER_10]: and at what times, because some chemicals
you have to pour in before the other ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I had a lot of frequent setbacks
and challenges with spray throughout the
[SPEAKER_10]: year.
[SPEAKER_10]: So second time I was spraying,
I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_10]: I went over a bump, my foot slipped off
the brake, and I ran into a post.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was freaking out.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was not okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: But physically I was okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: The tractor was fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: I called my boss.
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a post.
[SPEAKER_22]: Roll a place and call it Emily's post.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I have a legacy now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also ran out of gas and oil a lot,
the typical things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also, there was one day where my
tractor caught on fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: He started cables.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was a good time.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also did a lot of other non orchard
related tasks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they recently bought a new orchard,
and on it was the 1800s farmhouse that
[SPEAKER_10]: they wanted to renovate and make into an
Airbnb.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I spent a lot of time, including my
first day and my last day at work,
[SPEAKER_10]: renovating the house.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I garnished all the floors and I
painted most of the walls.
[SPEAKER_07]: I painted all this farm from here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turned out really, great actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really proud of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also did deliveries to local grocery
stores with some of our produce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also helped can hard cider for a
day.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some takeaways.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this was one of the most impactful
month and a halfs of my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really, really enjoyed my experience
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I talk about it all night,
all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my friends are tired of hearing me
talk about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, yeah, I couldn't have asked for a
better experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still, I realized I still have a lot to
learn and I'll just come with time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And being out in the field, talking to
people, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also learned through this that
connections are everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually got my current job,
which is my post graduate job,
[SPEAKER_10]: through this because my, so I'm working at
Agri-Fresh, which is a chemical company
[SPEAKER_10]: that does post harvest chemicals for
apples specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my boss at Agri-Fresh came to visit my
boss at Ricker Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my boss at Ricker Hill just started
talking about me and I thought I got the
[SPEAKER_10]: job.
[SPEAKER_10]: So connections, they're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also learned that waking up early can be
extremely rewarding, whether that's 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: once a week for spraying or my regular 5 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: wake up call.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth it to see the sunrise every
morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to thank Harry Ricker and
the rest of the team at Ricker Hill
[SPEAKER_07]: Orchards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very great experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I think it was like 300 acres.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's one of the two largest farms apple
orchards in Maine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they grew most of the big major
varieties.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then some other varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are starting some hard cider
varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do have some hard cidery.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sticking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Mike said, I'm George.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a student of plant science under
entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be talking about the
senior thesis I did in Jennifer Thaler's
[SPEAKER_01]: lab in entomology.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my two study organisms,
cabbage blooper and the tobacco farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start with a little story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as all great stories begin,
we have a plant just minding its own
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of the blue, a very intimidating
looking moth flies in and lays an egg on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, which hatches into a very small
caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caterpillar is going to start
munching on the plant and eating its sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of synthetic tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is a pretty
significant problem for a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is pretty alarmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it needs the postsynthetic tissue
to make energy and then survive and
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants can't simply, you know,
like squish an insect or run away from an
[SPEAKER_01]: insect like we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to come up with some creative
solutions to combat these insect pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: These creative solutions may take the form
of physical dispenses, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes that get in the way of insects
feeding on the plant or things like
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical dispenses that may be toxic to
the plant or maybe anti-nutritive and
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the way that insects can digest and
assimilate the energy the plant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two other ways we can classify these
defenses are constitutive and induced
[SPEAKER_01]: defenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So constitutive defenses are always
present in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit of those is that if an
insect comes and attacks you, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: defense is already there and you're
already ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, we have induced
defenses that are only synthesized when an
[SPEAKER_01]: insect feeds on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the benefit to this kind of technique
is that the response can be targeted to
[SPEAKER_01]: the specific insect that is attacking you
and that you don't waste energy producing
[SPEAKER_01]: defenses that you might not need if the
insect never comes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got these defenses, but we've got
kind of some other problems here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we started with a small
caterpillar, but the caterpillar is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in essence, the plant is not just
combating one insect life stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but many insect life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the caterpillar isn't just
taking this all in force.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trying to manipulate the interaction
as well so it can benefit and still grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and develop and reproduce on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a strategic standpoint,
the plant kind of wants to take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: this insect when it's smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a graph of how much this
tobacco hornworm caterpillar is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: eat as it grows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it can do a pretty
significant amount of damage once it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a fifth insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the plant can get rid of the insect
by either getting it to die or move to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant before it gets to this
severely damaging stage, that would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be a good idea and the best way
for it to invest its resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was what I was really
interested in is how these different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of the insect responded to
different manipulations of plant defenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were the questions that I asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I wanted to know if induction
affected the consumption at these
[SPEAKER_01]: different life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had plants that were uninduced that
just had constitutive defenses and plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that were induced that had both
constitutive and induced defenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will presumably be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question I asked was does
plant species affect the consumption at
[SPEAKER_01]: these different insect life stages?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have two different plant
species, say two different tomato species,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will presumably have a different
suite of constitutive induced defenses
[SPEAKER_01]: that the insects will possibly respond
differently to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I have the data on whether these
different stages respond differently to
[SPEAKER_01]: induction plant species, we can synthesize
whether the life stages as a whole are
[SPEAKER_01]: responding differently to manipulations of
plant quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the study system that I was
working in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had two different insect species,
Phrygoclusia nidae, the cabbage blooper,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a generalist, and the tobacco
hornworm, Manduka sexta, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist on solaceous crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had two different plant
species, species of tomatoes, the common
[SPEAKER_01]: viscid tomato, and the red currant tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were my experimental methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some tomato plants, approximately
80 of them that we grew in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we either treated them with a control
spray or we treated them with foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: desmonic acid, which induced defenses as
if an insect was feeding on the plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: create our two groups, induced and
uninduced plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We collected leaves and put them on petri
dishes for a bioassay, and then we put
[SPEAKER_01]: them with insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the neonate, the one day old
caterpillars, we just took them right
[SPEAKER_01]: after they hatched and put them on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the four and eight or nine day old
insects, they were reared on diet for
[SPEAKER_01]: those respective days and then put into
petri dishes for the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get some results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dissect these graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lighter bars are the plants that has
the control spray, and the dark red bars
[SPEAKER_01]: are the plants that were induced with
desmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The y-axis here is how much the
caterpillars consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, basically all three
stages, this is more than significant,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cabbage weaver responded to this
induction by reducing feeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: where only one insect, or life stage of
the tobacco hornworm, this middle stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: four days old, responded by reducing its
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's kind of interesting is when you
look at the same comparison, but looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the two different tomato species,
you have the common tomato in the lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: green and the red current tomato in the
darker green, we saw the opposite pattern,
[SPEAKER_01]: where all three life stages of the tobacco
hornworm were responsive to this
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulation of plant species,
but only one life stage, this middle stage
[SPEAKER_01]: again, was responsive in the cabbage
looper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's look at some key takeaways
from these experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some life stages of insects are indeed
more sensitive than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: This data suggests that maybe the middle
life stage is the most sensitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it was sensitive to all manipulations,
whereas the other life stages were only
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to some manipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible that plants may be charming
certain life stages, maybe the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: life stages, as we discussed at the
beginning, to try to get the insects to
[SPEAKER_01]: either die or move off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they can cause a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: One consideration is that a lot of
research uses these younger life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be over-exaggerating the effect
of these life stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as it's taken into
consideration that these trends may not
[SPEAKER_01]: hold for all insect life stages,
it's pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And possibly most importantly,
this whole interaction is very context
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on the species of the insect,
the life stage of the insect, the species
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant, whether or not the plant has
been induced or not, the age of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of these different metrics kind of
come together and mediate this interaction
[SPEAKER_01]: and how these two organisms are going to
interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd just like to say thank you to my
mentors, Dr. Thaler and Zoe, my grad
[SPEAKER_01]: student, and everyone else in the lab for
their advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was funded through an undergraduate
research grant with Morley Fund,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got some resources from Muscle Lab,
from the Duang lab, some references,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so as Mike said, my name's Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk a little bit about my
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about my
experience and one of the cool things I
[SPEAKER_03]: had with Dr. Thaler was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a team in spring of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the... So on the agenda for today,
we are going to be looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of type pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will focus on Sanctum Mugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at how it employs tile
factors in pathogenetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within tile factors, we're going to be
looking at how they function, how they
[SPEAKER_04]: bind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within binding studies, we're going to be
kind of looking at how we're improving
[SPEAKER_04]: that or at least trying to, and then
hopefully at the end, I'll be able to give
[SPEAKER_04]: it to you all that has the purpose of that
practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first up, we have the type pathogenic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the different kinds of type
pathogenic bacteria cause symptoms such as
[SPEAKER_04]: bacterial leach, streaks, everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see some of that on the top
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have bacterial leach streaks on rice,
and you can see a mango down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the primary agents of this is the
proteobacterium, which is hepatitis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hepatitis affects all sorts of different
kinds of crops, such as rice, wheat,
[SPEAKER_04]: corn, corn ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it causes a large amount of damage to
the tissue that ultimately results in loss
[SPEAKER_04]: of yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pushing the bad stuff away anyways,
some of the cool things about Sanctum Mugs
[SPEAKER_04]: is in one of the type of synthesis we have
just, which is a type of protein streaks
[SPEAKER_03]: that is transcription activated by the
factor or the tile factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be talking a little bit about exactly
what those are in a minute, but for now,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to give you a full view of how
Sanctum Mugs acts with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a putz up.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the top there, you can see we just have
a single in Sanctum Mugs bacterium.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically just shoving this massive
type 3 secretion system into a fat cell
[SPEAKER_04]: and creating a tile factor into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tile factor localizes to a nucleus and
binds specifically to a region of DNA that
[SPEAKER_04]: you reference in transcriptional
machinery.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will upregulate the downstream gene and
eventually cause cell death.
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on to actual tile factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you want to pay attention to is this
orange region right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the central region or the DNA in
Sanctum Mugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one of those orange little blocks
there represents three amino acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two amino acids are present in every
single one of these, again, in the 12th
[SPEAKER_04]: and 3rd generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are what conferred the efficacy
of DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a really quick, not very true rule
of thumb, you have something where Hd by
[SPEAKER_04]: Tc, Ng by T, Ni by Ni, and Ng.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how it actually converts its
testing as a tile factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up next, I have a little animation of me
that kind of shows you how a tile factor
[SPEAKER_04]: sits on DNA and how a tile factor
structure reveals what actually works.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a wonderful model right up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, it's just sitting in the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each of the red or blue coils are
different pieces and modules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the RVDs are present right in the very
center of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So referring back to that, we have the DNA
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we have the cell policy on the top,
which is a tile factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's defined typically for a
promoter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And defined so based on those RVDs,
I just want to know all those little
[SPEAKER_04]: modules interacting with the nucleotides,
RUIs, how and where to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's there, again, it pulls in the
transcription machinery, operates it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the house from June, which interferes as
the system usually ultimately results in
[SPEAKER_03]: an election.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does that exist in society?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the helpful and not so helpful
things about tile factors is that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: very high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is that if you had a
RVD by two specific nucleotide every
[SPEAKER_04]: single time, it'd be pretty easy to
predict where it might just be based on
[SPEAKER_03]: program math.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it doesn't quite work like that
because in the last, probably two years or
[SPEAKER_04]: three years, we've realized that the
specificity of an RVD here on one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: recheats is different, depending on where
it is in the tile factor sequence,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as what other kinds of RVDs it's
also around.
So something towards the edge,
something towards the edge here,
[SPEAKER_03]: the protein will hit differently than
something in the middle versus something
in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well, the layers that are around it
influence this idea as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't always work the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The helpful thing about the tile factors
being much of the nature is that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: relatively in the early submission period.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means we can do is we can
make these synthetic or designer tile
[SPEAKER_04]: factors in details where we can shuffle
these RVDs around if any have to choose or
[SPEAKER_04]: even incorporate ones that aren't commonly
found in the short-time nature at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this enables us to form these finding
assays where we can actually see how the
[SPEAKER_04]: position and neighbor effects actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, let's add the importance.
[SPEAKER_04]: These kinds of studies are important for
deeper aspects, both in type biology and
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: In type biology, specifically,
the reason that we're looking at it is
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's important to know where a
tile factor find can actually impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can, in some way or another,
disrupt the dining zone or false binding
[SPEAKER_04]: site to hopefully create these sorts of
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some programs that have been
designed to help us such as synthetic
[SPEAKER_04]: talent where you basically chug in a tile
factor sequence and then chug in a
[SPEAKER_04]: reference genome such as the right genome
and see approximately where it's actually
[SPEAKER_04]: locked.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with that is that we put in a
reference genome as well because the right
[SPEAKER_04]: genome can get a lot of case environments
in the tile factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they're missing a lot of data
about the neighbor effects and the
[SPEAKER_04]: position effects of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that matters because when it sits out
in these many different binding sites,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's possible to be able to screen through
all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that you can actually create,
again, these sorts of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, summarize thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I wanted to get out of this
entire presentation is that tile factors
[SPEAKER_04]: function by binding it directly to a
specific DNA sequence and inducing
[SPEAKER_04]: half-genesis after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond that, this interaction between the
tile factor and the DNA can be studied and
[SPEAKER_04]: predicted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully to much better, much better
testimony we have right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is incredibly important for
generating resistant crops and fueling the
[SPEAKER_04]: loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to do a special thanks to the
Hublot Lab and the entire Dr. Adam
[SPEAKER_04]: Vydanova over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and if you have any important
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So today I'm going to be talking about
endobacteria and mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some background.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are endobacteria?
[SPEAKER_07]: Endobacteria are bacteria that you can
find living in organisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this case, I'm specifically
interested in ones that live inside of
[SPEAKER_07]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And two different types have been
identified.
[SPEAKER_07]: Burkholderia-related endobacteria,
or VREs, which fall under Burkholderia AC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And mycoplasma-related endobacteria,
which fall under mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what's mortuerella?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it falls under mortuerella mecatina,
and it's an early divergent fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is also a soil fungi, and more
specifically, it's an endophytic fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's an endophytic fungi?
[SPEAKER_07]: An endophytic fungi is a fungi that lives
inside of plant tissue, and it can
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes help the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might provide some benefits,
and other times, it might do absolutely
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's between 100 and 170 different
species of mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from what I understand, they smell of
garlic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't know, because I kept my plate
sealed for safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: And something really important about them
is that they actually produce
[SPEAKER_07]: polyunsaturated acids, and I'll talk about
that later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a chart of the fungi that have
been found to have endobacteria inside of
[SPEAKER_07]: them, and they all fall under
mucormicotina.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first one to be discovered were
glomeromicotina, which mostly have
[SPEAKER_07]: Burkholderia AC, and then mucormicotina,
and then most recently, mortuerella
[SPEAKER_07]: micotina was discovered to have VRE and
mRNA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in 2008, the first endobacteria was
found in mortuerella, but it wasn't until
[SPEAKER_07]: 2016, eight years later, that it was
described and named, and it was made as
[SPEAKER_07]: microatops.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, it's a parasitic bacteria,
and it actually impacts the metabolism and
[SPEAKER_07]: the growth of mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can actually see it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are bacterial cells in a hyphae of
mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mentioned that it impacts the growth
and metabolism of mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the very top, you can actually see a
healthy mortuerella yaundata, and
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath that, that has been infested
microavidus, and as you can see,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not very pretty, it's not growing
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about mRNA?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, recently, in 2017, 12 different
mortuerella micotina were discovered to
[SPEAKER_06]: have mRNA inside of them, and nine of
those strains were mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we decided to survey our own
collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it looks kind of cool to see that
you have mRNA inside of mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: But why did we decide to do this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, mortuerella's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an endophyte of crocus and poplar,
and it actually is a beneficial endophyte
[SPEAKER_07]: of these plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also has commercial implications.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's used in fatty acid biosynthesis,
because I mentioned earlier that
[SPEAKER_07]: mortuerella produces polyunsaturated fatty
acids, and these fatty acids are used in
[SPEAKER_07]: infant formulas, they're used in
bioprofactants, and they're used in
[SPEAKER_07]: biofuels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but why does the endovector in
mortuerella matter about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as I mentioned earlier, it can
impact the growth and the metabolism of
[SPEAKER_07]: mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if it's impacting the growth,
this could potentially impact the fatty
[SPEAKER_07]: acid biosynthesis, it could impact the
crocus, it could impact anything that
[SPEAKER_07]: mortuerella's in what we're using
mortuerella for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the goal of our project was to look
for mycoavitus and other VRE inside of
[SPEAKER_07]: mortuerella, as well as to look for MRE
inside of our mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, we grew up six different strains
of mortuerella that we had in our lab,
[SPEAKER_07]: or in our collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see here, we also had
mortuerella elandata, so we were really
[SPEAKER_07]: hoping, it was promising that we had
mortuerella elandata, we were hoping we'd
[SPEAKER_07]: have something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what was the procedure?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we did DNA extraction with liquid
nitrogen, we ground up the fungal hyphae
[SPEAKER_07]: into a small powder, and then we used a
kind of DNA easy plant mini kit in order
[SPEAKER_07]: to extract the DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did PCR using 16S RNA gene primers,
we used taxon specific at first,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we used universal bacterial
primers to try and find anything that was
[SPEAKER_07]: in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we did Sanger sequencing,
and we did data analysis, mostly using
[SPEAKER_07]: BLAST, we ran it through the BLAST
database to see if we could find anything
[SPEAKER_07]: that was similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, my first lesson from this project,
MRE specific primers, we used those,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the expectation was that we would get
MRE.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our result was that we got nothing,
no PCR products.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, however, we did not, at the time,
have an MRE specific positive control on
[SPEAKER_07]: hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, besides this, a potential reason that
it could have not worked is that these
[SPEAKER_07]: primers were not developed for mortuerella
microtina, they were developed for
[SPEAKER_07]: glomerulmicrotina, which could impact how
they work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Second lesson, I used universal bacterial
primers that were highly recommended,
[SPEAKER_07]: they came from the earth microbiome,
and our expectation was that we would get
[SPEAKER_07]: 16S RNA genes, sequences of bacteria,
any bacteria that was present.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, it generated fungal sequences,
18S RNA genes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, why did this happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: Potentially because these primers do not
discriminate against fungal sequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, in a good turn of events,
we actually got novel 18S RNA sequence of
[SPEAKER_06]: mortuerella.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had all these, and we were like,
well, why would it be novel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Potential that it's a new species that
hasn't been discovered yet because it is
[SPEAKER_07]: genetically far from all the other
isolates that we found in the black
[SPEAKER_07]: statics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesson number three, this time we used
universal bacterial primers that exclude
[SPEAKER_07]: fungal DNA for RNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: The logic was that we did a virtual PCR on
a computer using the mortuerella genome,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it identified these primers saying
they would not amplify fungal genome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the expectation, we would get that
bacterial and not fungal DNA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we didn't get either of those,
but we did get mitochondrial sequences.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, again, bonus, these sequences had
never been sequenced before, so we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to submit them to GeneBank.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my conclusions, primers have a lot of
different utilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: They may not do just what you want them to
do, they do a lot of different things,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have to be careful selecting your
tools because, again, they might not do
[SPEAKER_07]: what you want, or they might do something
else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And correct controls are important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without those controls, you might not know
if your tools aren't working just because
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't work for your specific thing,
or if they're not working because there's
[SPEAKER_07]: nothing there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Future work on this, I'm not going to be
doing this because I'm graduating,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the lab is looking into this,
potentially developing new primer sets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all these different primers that
we could use and try different sets of
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll use primers that have already been
developed that are in the literature,
[SPEAKER_07]: we just haven't read yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or there's a couple different types of
experiments we could design instead.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could strain fungal nuclei and isolate
bacterial DNA from those.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could stain the fungal hyphae and look
for bacteria that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we could do whole genome sequencing of
the fungal DNA and then isolate bacterial
[SPEAKER_07]: DNA from that, so that would be a big
undertaking because that's extensive and a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to give a big thanks to the
Palasco Lab, and specifically Dr. Theresa
[SPEAKER_07]: Palasco.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without her, I wouldn't have been able to
do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Chase Myers, who was extremely,
extremely helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: He helped me at every single turn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dr. Maria Laura Gasper, she helped out
and she helped us use, she allowed us to
[SPEAKER_07]: use her equipment, which was thousands of
dollars worth of equipment that was big
[SPEAKER_07]: and very easy to drop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was just like, yeah, go ahead and
use it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Without them, I wouldn't have been able to
do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did she use the prop?
[SPEAKER_07]: We, at the time, did not have any MRE that
we could use.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't until later that we isolated
some MREs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have any sequences.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we didn't have any sequences.
[SPEAKER_07]: We later isolated, well, Dr. Chase Myers
later isolated some MRE that we were then
[SPEAKER_07]: using.
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions?
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Hi,
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Mike Senn.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Monica.
[SPEAKER_14]: And today I'm going to talk to you about
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to begin this talk by saying
live spots.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who know me personally,
I'm the potato guy on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had this personal interest since I
was a little lad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew up next to a potato and grain
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: I became friends with a local farmer and
just really loved potato plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the machinery associated with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't wait to see them every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on a more important note, it's
actually a very important global
[SPEAKER_04]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen reports, it's number three or
four.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's definitely in the top 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very high, important for nutrient
resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, for America, we have potato
chips.
[SPEAKER_04]: My personal favorite is nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you haven't tried them,
I really suggest you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit about the history of the
program itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I can tell, it started way back
in the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a lot different than it is
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of that change was in the 1940s
and 50s, there was the introduction of the
[SPEAKER_04]: gold nematode in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to combat this, the program started to
try to breed resistance into its potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long came Dr. Doug Placedad and he helped
craft what the current program is today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit about potato
classification itself, because of course,
[SPEAKER_04]: there isn't just one potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have potatoes for chipping potatoes,
potatoes for fresh market, french fries,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything under the sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this program breeds for chipping
potatoes and potato stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it comes to chipping potatoes,
fry color is the most important because no
[SPEAKER_04]: one wants to eat a burnt potato chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: For fresh market, it's more about the
appearance of the potato, because when you
[SPEAKER_04]: walk into Wegmans and you see all these
beautiful potatoes, it makes you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing weird in the shape of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all nice and shiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit about the overview of the
breeding program itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really condensed version and
some potatoes were put on the fast track,
[SPEAKER_04]: some were more slow to get through all the
steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So around years zero, there's 50 to 100
pollinations made up in Gooderman
[SPEAKER_04]: Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these potatoes once pollinated
actually create true berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each one of these berries has lots of
seeds in it that are all genetically
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the following year, these are all
planted out in the greenhouse and then
[SPEAKER_04]: transplanted and raised.
[SPEAKER_04]: And each one of these seeds has a truly
unique potato to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have 20,000, around 20,000 unique
plants every year that get added to the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: In years two through five, there's
increased breeding selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where you start actually
looking at, you know, are these potatoes
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to eat or do we want to discard
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this increase in breeding selection
happens, keeps happening every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's clonal propagation of
potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who don't know,
potatoes are planted with actual seed
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces, but these aren't known as true
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically any ordinary potato,
you cut them up and you need one or two
[SPEAKER_04]: eyes for each to grow a new plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So around year six, there's what's called
advanced breeding trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these take place around campus in
upstate New York to see how these potatoes
[SPEAKER_04]: are actually going to perform on real farm
trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then around year 11, we have eventual
clone release where it is released to
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers who could then grow it and be
profited off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So moving on to chipping potatoes,
currently Cornell's Lamoca potato is the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest seed acreage in the world for any
chipping potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a huge accomplishment for the
program.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I really wanted to highlight it
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for one reason, it has a really nice
fry color to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, it's almost paper white.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chipped processes really like to see this
and it's a very popular potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some other characteristics that are
important to chipping potatoes are yield
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, this is always true among plant
breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a specific shape potato
processors like a spherical shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: This way, when the potato goes through all
the machinery to cut it into potato chips,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not getting jammed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes in all over some other hot shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Storability is also very important for
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: For potato production, they're dug in the
fall and then put into cold storage for
[SPEAKER_04]: months at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want your whole crop to rot
away before you use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then bruising is also very important
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potatoes are machine harvested and you get
tossed around a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want something that's going
to have ugly chatter bruises and dark
[SPEAKER_04]: spots and when you want to fry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to table stock potatoes,
such as ender on that bread and ender on
[SPEAKER_04]: that fluid breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said earlier, appearance is really
a key characteristic here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want something that's pretty and it's
going to attract the consumer to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heal is also, again, a very important
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Storability, the shape here is not as
important as in chipping potatoes because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not being processed like a potato
chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can have oval potatoes,
spherical potatoes, fingerlings,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything under the sun that people think
consumers are going to want to buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooking characteristics also play an
important role here.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times there's tests such as the
African color darkening test to see after
[SPEAKER_04]: the potatoes are boiled, do they turn a
weird color?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they turn mush?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they maintain their composition?
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, bruising is also another
important characteristic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to break up this talk a little
bit and actually show what the field,
[SPEAKER_04]: what preparation in the field looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this first video is of potato planting,
which is going on right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically you have a potato planter
that opens up a furrow down the field
[SPEAKER_04]: where a seed piece drops, a little bit of
fertilizer and some chemicals are sprayed
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the planter covers it up in a
hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So potatoes are grown in a hill because if
the sunlight reaches them, they'll turn
[SPEAKER_04]: green and are slightly toxic for this
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything is grown in the hill,
it's the sunlight and then the potatoes
[SPEAKER_04]: are happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we have potato harvest,
which you have this machine that basically
[SPEAKER_04]: scoops up the potato hill, shakes all the
dirt off of it and the potatoes right out
[SPEAKER_04]: the back of the digger onto the ground
where people pick them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will say this is very small scale
compared to other farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very unique to the Cornell potato
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the farms that I work, you have huge
machines that are like doing six to 12
[SPEAKER_04]: rows at a time versus two rows that people
pick them up instead of trucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to really hit on the
significance of this program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now Golden Emetote is under control in
New York state.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quarantine areas are actually
shrinking, which is an awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I mentioned before, Cornell bread
potatoes are vitally grown in New York and
[SPEAKER_04]: around the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limoca is number one in the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another chip stock, Juanita is also very
popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my favorite thing about the program is
that practical research that's done here
[SPEAKER_04]: is helping everyday farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with at least five farmers
that are growing Cornell bread potatoes
[SPEAKER_04]: and this makes me very proud to work on
this program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to give a special shout out to
Walter, Matt Feliz who is the field
[SPEAKER_04]: technician, Dr. Nock placed it,
and then the awesome potato crew that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: worked with the past four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand this is for the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you look at nutritional value at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's one of the main
characteristics that they're bred for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know like yesterday we heard a talk on
like orange sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's any like breeding
that's trying to introduce more
[SPEAKER_04]: nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Walter, can you weigh in on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: For the table stock, not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the whole thing with flavor is
if it wasn't for the program giving free
[SPEAKER_04]: samples out to people at the Love Lab,
there really wouldn't be like an official
[SPEAKER_04]: taste testing of a potato either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Mike said, my name is Yuki.
[SPEAKER_04]: My project is regarding breeding down in
the loop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as many of you guys probably already
know, in patients, it's a very common,
[SPEAKER_04]: very desirable ornamental crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is grown as annual all across the
United States and it is highly valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to be one of the most important
ornamental plants before this disease came
[SPEAKER_04]: to North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: It first occurred in 2004 in sporadic
incidences in Florida or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 2011 it spread much more quickly to
the northern parts of the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: The symptoms include a stunting and
defoliation as well as the flowers drop
[SPEAKER_04]: and stems collapse eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant dies within around two weeks
and there is no cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And due to that, the wholesale value of
the patients dropped from 163 million in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2000 to only 6.5 million in 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it got so bad that in parts of
New York, this plant stopped being offered
[SPEAKER_04]: at gardeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they just stopped selling it because
they knew that people bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be dead within two weeks if
they get infected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Customers would not be happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why you don't see a lot of
eucachus waterianae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there are other alternatives to
eucachus waterianae, such as eucachus
[SPEAKER_04]: ocrean, which is another species,
most common name is the New Guinea
[SPEAKER_04]: eucachus.
[SPEAKER_04]: These eucachus require more light and they
cannot tolerate full shade like
[SPEAKER_04]: waterianae.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are also probably an asexually
not seed, which is more costly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are less drought resistant
compared to waterianae.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also other hybridic patients that
are alternative, but they're also very
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive because they're not seed
propagated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in case of waterianae, it fits a lot
of special niches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have becoming all colors
except blue and yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have smaller, more numerous flowers
and they can cover the entire area with a
[SPEAKER_04]: color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can be grown in full shade,
which is very unusual for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're very easy to grow and they're
powder to heat and they are also good
[SPEAKER_04]: drought.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are also very adaptable to
containers, making a brick of container
[SPEAKER_04]: gardening and putting them on a patio or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also seed propagated with very
high germination.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of the objectives for my research was
that I would use the, elaborate on the
[SPEAKER_04]: reading efforts of Teach and Lafa,
who was a grad student at James Teach and
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick McDonough, who was a senior when I
was a freshman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they aimed at selecting in-patients,
waterianae, varieties with potential
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance to the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I will conduct a breeding trial
on these two hybrids of in-patients
[SPEAKER_04]: waterianae that was selected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will carry on a field trial on Long
Island in San Mateo to test their
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance to the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I developed two in-bred lines of
in-patients waterianae.
[SPEAKER_04]: I developed in-bred line two of the
in-patients waterianae hybrids that were
[SPEAKER_04]: gained from our research.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are 222-4 and 219.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I evaluated their seed production,
their flower color and their overall
[SPEAKER_04]: horticultural traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in July of 2017, I was at the
Cornell University Long Island
[SPEAKER_04]: Horticulture Research Center, Long Island,
and to test how these plants do in the
[SPEAKER_04]: natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a shade hoop with a shade cloth
for these plants, but they like shade.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also did overhead watering to help
inoculate or to help increase the chances
[SPEAKER_04]: of infection.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're actually not supposed to overhead
watering patients due to this,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I was doing this that way so I could
see the progression of the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't do this at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I also made this little graph for
ranking the disease as well as the health
[SPEAKER_04]: of the plant from zero to five with zero
being no disease present and five being a
[SPEAKER_04]: dead plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plant health proposed the opposite way
with zero being a dead plant and five
[SPEAKER_04]: being a healthy green plant with great
foliage, a lot of flowers and a bushy
[SPEAKER_04]: growing habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that that a customer would
see at a store and want to buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a picture of the beginning of
the trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants are all very small at the
moment because of these cuttings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have replicates of three in each of
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each individual has three replicates and
there's about 700 or so plants in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I infected the plants at around the two
weeks after the start of the field trial
[SPEAKER_04]: in July and the drug at the trial plants
declined greatly within two weeks and some
[SPEAKER_04]: of them died after that, around two and a
half weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a few plants did show strong
resistance and there was also a few that
[SPEAKER_04]: showed no incidence of the disease at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes even actually overcame the
disease, which I was very surprised.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these plants all displayed much more,
much more attractive or over such as a
[SPEAKER_04]: bushy growing habit, a lot of flowers,
a good flower size and color as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: more stems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a picture of the incidence of
the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: That white stuff there you see are all
spores that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the disease does is it's spread
through splashes of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water splashes out to a leaf,
but which can explode.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we might see it travels into the
stomata, into the stomata of the plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes systemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's rare in cities because you don't
actually see the disease before it's too
[SPEAKER_04]: late because by the time it makes these
spores, the disease has already become
[SPEAKER_04]: systemic within the plant and it's got
this high feed all over the inside of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they only occur on the underside of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very hard to see in like a private
setting in a garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a good picture that I took of
some resistant plants here versus these
[SPEAKER_04]: non-resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, many of the leaves here
are just white stuff, they're just spores
[SPEAKER_04]: and the leaves are, you know, they're
stunted, they're falling down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants just generally don't look very
nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these plants, they are so close to
this plant that was infected, but they
[SPEAKER_04]: show no incidence of the disease at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: The leaves are healthy and green.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even flowers over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants are definitely resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are all the plants that I isolated
out of 700 or so that did show very high
[SPEAKER_04]: resistance as well as health.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, none of these plants exceeded
a disease score of over one, which is very
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them have zero values.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their health score was never below
four, which is also very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything above four will be a nice
plant for a consumer to buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a graph that I made of some
resistant ones and some non-resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see at the beginning of the,
well, near the end of the field trial,
[SPEAKER_04]: the disease scores slowly increase from
zero all the way up to five when they die.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these plants, the disease score starts
low and remains low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even in this case, this green line
here, which is plant number 76,
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant actually, you know,
went from being diseased to not diseased,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is very interesting because with
this plant, it had the spores on this
[SPEAKER_04]: disease, but it dropped immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably showed like a hypersensitive
response, and it cut off the leaf right
[SPEAKER_04]: away, and it never got detected again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was very interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will say that this trial was very
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said there's several plants with very
high resistance and very high
[SPEAKER_04]: horticultural merit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these plants were also able to
overcome in patients tomato spotted road
[SPEAKER_04]: virus, which is a deadly virus that
usually kills patients and tomatoes very
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these plants were able to overcome
that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened was, I didn't plan for this
at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the plants growing in the greenhouse
before I planted them in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the greenhouse next to mine happened
to be doing a insect trial with thrips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, there's a tiny and they
probably, you know, have transmitted
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pretty soon all of my plants were
infected with the virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus I removed all the leaves that were
infected and the plant that my patient
[SPEAKER_04]: that overcame the virus, which was very
good for me because I thought I was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to lose all of my research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so this just goes to demonstrate
just how resilient and vigorous these
[SPEAKER_04]: plants can be, even taking over from the
virus as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to stress the need for
genetic diversity in patients because one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the reasons why this whole thing with
downy who came to be in person is because
[SPEAKER_04]: all the hybrids done on Moiriana was based
on, was based only on Moiriana and a few
[SPEAKER_04]: related species.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was not really a lot of genetic
material being used.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a result of that, most of the
plants had a very narrow, there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: bottleneck effect in the knowledge of
genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of these plants were all susceptible
to the disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen cases like this before,
such as in, you know, the potato famine,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hunters were quite hopper infested,
killing off all the Irish local potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I would just stress that as
we go forward, we could be using more,
[SPEAKER_04]: more diverse species into our breeding
programs to incorporate some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: disease resistance rates into these
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't have to go through this,
this kind of like trying to catch up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the passion, like the passion starts doing
stuff and then we do breeding for breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, in the future, I would like to
improve the flower shape and the color of
[SPEAKER_04]: these plants as well as the size of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll also produce sterile seedlings
that we think are healthy seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll also try to intergress the
resistance rate as well as the
[SPEAKER_04]: corticosteroids into the deep lines to
complete the disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll also grow these individuals in
the metro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, as part of a side project,
I did like a, I did a project regarding
[SPEAKER_04]: how to make a cuticle and corticosteroids
for the patients because there is no
[SPEAKER_04]: leather shoe that exists on how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did work on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, it can also investigate how IDM
evolves in knocking in plants and loosely
[SPEAKER_04]: further evidence on disease resistance and
also explore the heritability and
[SPEAKER_04]: stability of the resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to give special thanks to Dr.
Mark Virgin, who is my supervisor and also
[SPEAKER_04]: the head of the Long Island Horticulture
Museum, et cetera, as well as Dr. Matt
[SPEAKER_04]: McGrath, who is the pathologist there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very nice and talking a lot about and
also everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked about diversity in patients,
which I completely agree.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, and then you talked about using
other species.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about diversity within Walleriana?
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of diversity within
Walleriana as well, but see if all the
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids that are created, they're just
used.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though there is a lot of diversity
within the species itself, they're not
[SPEAKER_04]: really used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could diversify within Walleriana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Mike said, I'm Kylie and today I'll
be talking to you about my research that I
[SPEAKER_07]: did over the 2018 summer at the University
of Nebraska Lincoln on delayed emergency
[SPEAKER_07]: impacts on foreign care information
issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little bit about the internship.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was an RU program there was a
little over 100 students together.
[SPEAKER_07]: The internships range from chemistry to
plant science, integrated ag systems to go
[SPEAKER_07]: on the island.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in total there were nine of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: The internship focused on really
understanding how to create projects
[SPEAKER_07]: surrounding really integrated ag.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also did some outreach with extension
and um, we did a presentation in Baltimore
[SPEAKER_07]: over, we had made a poster presentation
that we had.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so my project was, um, looking at the
ear formation issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the 2016 growing season,
farmers have reported up to 50% loss
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the issues of, um, short house
barbell ears to faulty ears for known.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so this was really tricky for my
preference because, um, they're in a
[SPEAKER_07]: breath and they, uh, everything is really
controlled.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water, um, is controlled with the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So your hypothesis was that some of these
foreign or kind of information issues were
[SPEAKER_07]: delayed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we looked at the um, as a factor of
which, um, kind of projects or is,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, a symptom of these ear formation
issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so what we did is I had a plot,
um, um, central Nebraska and there we
[SPEAKER_07]: planted corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,
[SPEAKER_07]: we, I measured the height of the last
developed leaf at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also took the plant stage up until
our one, which is the silking and that
[SPEAKER_07]: much of the silk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We let go for the next stage or two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that point in time, we looked at if
there was any ear formation issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my results, um, there was no
interaction between the, um, between the
[SPEAKER_07]: hybrid and planting date.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how we have a graph like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was a statistical significance
between the check hybrid that was
[SPEAKER_07]: susceptible to the, um, ear formation or
not susceptible to the information issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but if we look at the proper planting
date, there's really, there's some
[SPEAKER_07]: significance, but it's erratic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last plant to date is not some of the
first one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so it's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the leaf height.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a similar trend on both the check
hybrid and susceptible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and the fact that the height of the
first two and kind of the third plant to
[SPEAKER_07]: date were just, were not significantly
different to the last plant to date was,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, which can be expected because the
first, um, three plant to date had about,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, 60 days of growing where the last one
was 7 at the end of my trial.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then intermediate length, um,
also had a very similar trend,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, in that the first two plant to date
had a smaller internet length,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the last two had significantly longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, this can be explained because of the
pressure of which the corn, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: were under.
[SPEAKER_07]: There, we did a block design, it was a
four block board design.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whenever the last plant to date,
um, started to come up, these,
[SPEAKER_07]: the earlier plant to dates were already
four or five feet tall, and they kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: just put all of the horizon, they just put
all of their resources into just growing
[SPEAKER_07]: higher to get access to the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so in conclusion, and we kind of
summarized my graphs, um, sun diameter
[SPEAKER_07]: really didn't seem to change all that
much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which meant the plant to date,
uh, leaf height was significantly
[SPEAKER_07]: decreased, which is, um, then reasonable
that the internet length was significantly
[SPEAKER_07]: longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and unfortunately we did not see any
internet, or any information issues,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is really good for the program this
year, but, um, we're going to have to,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're redoing the experiment next year
because, um, everything that we thought
[SPEAKER_07]: would be an indicator apparently isn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, um, that, that is a good thing
because I got to learn how to,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, communicate results that weren't
exactly what we expect, um, which is a
[SPEAKER_07]: really good skill I learned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I'd really like to thank,
um, everyone at UNL that I came a little
[SPEAKER_07]: closer to actually talk about your own
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was signed in by the USDA NIAF and,
um, that's about right, that you live.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you expect to be an impact on more
information this year is kind of a good
[SPEAKER_03]: best year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should they worry about it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I I don't think I mean Because like we
show that like they're going To grow not
[SPEAKER_07]: quite as tall, but it doesn't mean that
we're starting
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where they're planting next
year What they did last year But the field
[SPEAKER_07]: that I was in was dry land corn,
so there's no overhead irrigation,
[SPEAKER_07]: but So everything is more subjected to
whatever nature has and with that we
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi everyone, my name is
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes The hypothesis of why they are broken
have multiple health benefits is it can
[SPEAKER_07]: form a viscous layer as a barrier in guard
up to its meals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're in care of food waste,
they can block the sugar absorption and
[SPEAKER_07]: this can lead to many other effects such
as producing the goods of coronary heart
[SPEAKER_22]: disease and type 2 diabetes.
[SPEAKER_22]: So why do I focus on oats in these
projects?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's because oats is a major food source
of beta-protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have oats in your diet,
you can easily get a bit of gluten better
[SPEAKER_07]: than you need dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a notation from FDA in 1997
which states that if you eat more oats,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can reduce the heart disease.
[SPEAKER_22]: This project is also a product of
transcriptions and antibiotics project.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what is NIA-INFRA?
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is basically when you input your
samples and you record the response of
[SPEAKER_07]: your samples to the NIA-INFRA.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our project, this is the absorption
of the sample at each woodlands of the
[SPEAKER_07]: NIA's light.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the light is imposed on the
sample, the temporal bone in the sample
[SPEAKER_22]: can stretch the light and which may
produce some overtones which will collect
[SPEAKER_22]: fingerprints of the temporal compounds in
the sample.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in our case, the temporal and the
vertical information about the sample were
[SPEAKER_22]: interested in the beta-protein
concentration.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why do I want to predict the
beta-protein concentration by this method?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in our oats breeding project,
we want to include the beta-protein
[SPEAKER_07]: content in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we hope to know the beta-protein
content of the generation we have and the
[SPEAKER_07]: two classes we have at which stage of the
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for traditional methods of measuring
the beta-protein, the seeds will be
[SPEAKER_07]: destroyed when the measure beta-protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the seeds cannot be used for sections,
packing, and hybrid evaluation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by this method, we can quickly measure
lots of samples and know that also it has
[SPEAKER_22]: a low cost of handling.
[SPEAKER_22]: Low cost of time handling.
[SPEAKER_22]: So our hypothesis is that this method can
predict the beta-protein metal well,
[SPEAKER_07]: which means the predicted metal by this
method and the opposite metal measured by
[SPEAKER_07]: traditional methods have a high
correlation, which is the same volume.
[SPEAKER_07]: The materials I used in this project
consisted of two candles.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is the diagnostic candle, which was
brought in from GALP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this diagnostic candle represents the
varieties that are in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the elite panel consists of the
parents and students who were breeding
[SPEAKER_22]: projects for elite cardboard.
[SPEAKER_22]: Elite cardboard.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this panel was repeated in three
locations, which are all major of the two
[SPEAKER_22]: methods.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the equipment I used for the
data capture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the seed advisor in the sorrel
setup.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a demo of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I introduce it into the 48 round tray
and put it on the top of the machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: The machine will guide the seed one by one
into a light tube.
[SPEAKER_07]: The light tube will gather the information
of the seed and the seed will slide down
[SPEAKER_07]: into another 38 round tray.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the actual view, the seed always
starts to have gaps on the extension.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how I measure the levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the protocol.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the beta-protein is brought
down to the intermediate, which is the
[SPEAKER_07]: glucose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the concentration of the glucose gets
measured.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the air goes up to the beta-protein.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the seeds are grinding into powders and
loading into the siding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's well-made.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the enzymes were added to the tubes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the final sample will measure on this
section here and compare it to the deep
[SPEAKER_22]: glucose in the nephrine sample and convert
it back to the beta-protein.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is some of their proof of sensing
to make sure the barrels are gathered from
[SPEAKER_22]: this one dinosaur and the structure on
there.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the left one is some guess of
beta-protein that's good to reduce the
[SPEAKER_22]: effect from sample-like gathering.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the right one is I put some standard
flower samples from the mega-antibiotic on
[SPEAKER_22]: initial to 96 times base to reduce the
random error among each batch of samples.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is the model building part.
[SPEAKER_22]: The model building is some
machine-grinding process.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the bottom line is actually this
flower collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first is to separate the data into
techniques that actually sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the data according to the
diversity panel and the suiting rate
[SPEAKER_22]: panels.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is just very simple.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a big combination along the four
panels.
[SPEAKER_22]: And the left one is I find the optimal
number of things per component.
[SPEAKER_22]: What I'm sure is what I'm calling them.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is for explaining what was the
variation in the sample by reducing the
[SPEAKER_22]: possibility of overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is some of their results.
[SPEAKER_22]: This is another proof that you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so the first thing, we got is the
comparison between each combinations of
[SPEAKER_07]: techniques that at a training set.
[SPEAKER_07]: The distribution is visualized from a
different data performance of the
[SPEAKER_07]: investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next thing that we got is the
comparison between different
[SPEAKER_07]: preprocessing, mass preprocessing
investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we do find that some of us have
better performance than other ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a major issue in these results is the
overfeeding activity, which means that
[SPEAKER_07]: hypothesis was not satisfied.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it asked by a lot of us very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are some of those traditions of
these costs?
[SPEAKER_07]: So the major, so the idea that there are
groups that are better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, that's better traction
separately.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I found that data group and reference
viral is more reliable because it has a
[SPEAKER_22]: decent process durability.
[SPEAKER_22]: But for the yes viral, the process
durability is very low, which means the
[SPEAKER_22]: yes viral is not very reliable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this can be some general errors
from the single-see analysis.
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is more scientific explanation.
[SPEAKER_22]: So those are the results.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, these are some of my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you come up with a method in your
experiments, you can always think of
[SPEAKER_07]: several different ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can have a comparison and choose
the best one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always underestimate my efficiency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I don't do something, I'm just going
to think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I actually do this, there will be
a lot of problems involved and more
[SPEAKER_07]: pressure than I didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I need more time to solve these
problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think before proceeding to the
next step, so we want to find a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you cannot save at the end of
the experiment.
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, especially with experiments people,
I usually like to do things myself or do
[SPEAKER_07]: some other kind of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think when people can,
yeah, largely include my efficiency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, keep photos.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my idea, but I feel this is
important.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you always keep photos, you can have
photos for the next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just thanks to the three PIs for
giving me a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: We consistently stated that Zhuying's
takeaway messages were the absolute best
[SPEAKER_13]: takeaway messages for every scientist
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, my name is Gabriel Green.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be talking to you guys about
some research that I've been doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is still ongoing, which is looking
into the impact of hydroponic nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions on the performance of dragon
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll start by just telling you guys a
little bit about what hydroponics is for
[SPEAKER_04]: those of you who are unaware.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's any system of growing plants in a
soil with medium where both water and
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients are being recirculated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this can come in a number of forms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's just a few examples I'll share
with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's deep water culture,
where the roots of the crops are just
[SPEAKER_04]: submerged in a pool of sitting nutrient
rich water.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nutrient film technique,
where a thin film of nutrient rich water
[SPEAKER_04]: is constantly flowing underneath the roots
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's aeroponics, where just a mist of a
nutrient rich mist is sprayed interrelate
[SPEAKER_04]: on the roots of the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's aquaponics, where instead of
putting in mineral nutrients, you actually
[SPEAKER_04]: take fish food and pesticides to be used
in the plants, and filter that water and
[SPEAKER_04]: filter on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of benefits to
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The obvious one would be in food
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's lots of environmental benefits
to hydroponics in food production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll use this example of Gotham Greens,
which is a big leafy green producer in New
[SPEAKER_04]: York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: So water and land conservation,
Gotham Greens, for example, uses 90% less
[SPEAKER_04]: water than traditional soil-based leafy
greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's obviously no agricultural runoff
because they're not in soil, and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: pesticide-free since they're in a green
house.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also enable local food production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of the usual trucking in all
your leafy greens from California to New
[SPEAKER_04]: York City, you can get them straight from
a local farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's obviously no soil erosion or
degradation because they're not even in
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also lots of benefits to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in hydroponics, or really any form of
controlled environment agriculture,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's more precise quality control just
because you're in control of various
[SPEAKER_04]: abiotic and biotic factors, which tends to
lead to more precise control of the
[SPEAKER_04]: quality of your end product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also less the risk of
foodborne illness because there's less
[SPEAKER_04]: soilborne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then besides food production,
which is often talked about benefit to
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponics, there's lots of cultural
benefits to hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been lots of developments in
the realm of urban green space thanks to
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have been found in the literature
that there's lots of benefits,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in an increasingly urbanized
world, to be exposed more to plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: green space, like improved emotional
states, increased your activity,
improved past performance, and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's a picture of a hydroponically
sustained plant wall at a student center
[SPEAKER_04]: in Harvard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as in your university, they can
certainly use all these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether you're a big vertical farm,
or you design plant walls, or you're just
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious growing who knows what in your
basement, there's lots of nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: available to you, both commercially and
non-commercially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the purpose of my research was to see
how some of the more popular commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponic nutrient options compare,
and also the Sanibel solution,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a non-commercial hydroponic
nutrient recipe that is often used in
[SPEAKER_04]: green health, in green houses like Cornell
and by researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all these different options have
differences in concentrations of micro and
[SPEAKER_04]: macro nutrients, as well as differences in
recommended feeding schedules by a few
[SPEAKER_04]: different brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were looking at how those can
actually perform sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bit about our methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we germinated our lettuce for 10 days
in Rockwell, which is just an inert
[SPEAKER_04]: growing medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: We transplanted them after 10 days,
each plant in its own little one gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: bucket containing a gallon of nutrient
solution, which we switched out every
[SPEAKER_04]: week.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an air stone in each bucket
connected to a pump to oxygenate the
[SPEAKER_04]: roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also, so twice a week we would
buffer the pH to be between 5.5 and 6.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the optimal range for nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had an Argus system,
which was monitoring abiotic factors like
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthetic reactive radiation,
humidity, temperature, and also tracking
[SPEAKER_04]: how those factors vary over the course of
seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had six different treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which were the five commercial nutrient
solutions and the Sanibel solution I
[SPEAKER_04]: showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's four replicates in each treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, we replaced the nutrients
weekly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did three different trials and one
trial was in the dead of winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some high pressure sodium lamps,
just supplement the light to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: trial a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the metrics we were going by to
evaluate the performance of the different
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions was the leaf dimensions,
the mass of the head, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also at the end of the harvest we did
a tissue nutrient analysis to see the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient concentrations of the different
micro-micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the crop that we used was dragon
lettuce, which is like a pretty much a
[SPEAKER_04]: mini Romaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we picked it because obviously Romaine
has huge commercial value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also it grows a bit quicker because it's
smaller so you can bang out the trials
[SPEAKER_04]: faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a trendy lettuce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's just some of our results from
the first trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bar graph up top is fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were surprised at the disparity
between the different solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were three statistical groups,
with Jax in the lead being the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: The subsequent four being statistically
about similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then elite nutrients, being in the
last class.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was also interesting because Jax,
the best one, was by far the cheapest,
[SPEAKER_04]: and elite nor was he.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these results were about proportional
for leaf dimensions and head mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also did nutrient analysis of the
solutions themselves and of the lettuce,
[SPEAKER_04]: which would give us an idea of the
concentration of micro-micronutrients in
[SPEAKER_04]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the nutrient analysis ended up being a
little bit unrivaled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're still working that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And special thanks to Chris Levine,
my research partner, Neil Masson,
[SPEAKER_04]: who advised us in this research,
all the grad students in the Cornell CEA
[SPEAKER_04]: group who also advised us, and Michael
Grudewski for helping us with the nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you presented these results yet,
so that we can thank you for helping us?
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't presented it to them,
but I was wondering what you guys think
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll get from these.
[SPEAKER_17]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_17]: One more.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what was the difference between
solutions from the micro-micronutrient and
[SPEAKER_22]: the social pyro?
[SPEAKER_22]: Or the source of nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the difference between these two
solutions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the most significant difference is
probably in the macronutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: N, P, and K, and also the source of those
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some provide more nitrogen, for example,
in the form of nitrate versus ammonium,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the balance between those also has an
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that will have a
better idea of how to get the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens to those solutions when
you're done growing plants in them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we do with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do with the solutions once you
grow those plants in them?
[SPEAKER_03]: We dump them down in the drain once in a
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the assertion that it's environmentally
neutral?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's no runoff into the soil,
per se.
[SPEAKER_17]: We should dump them on Bill's yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good point.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Sorry.
OK,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, as I said, my name is Connie
Schieder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a senior in plant sciences and my
concentration is ecology and landscape.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today I'll be presenting the results
in my honors research thesis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which for this presentation, I am titling
Determinants of Soil Microbial Composition
[SPEAKER_07]: in Temperate Forests.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just an overview of what I'll be
covering in my presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to start off with background
information, mostly because this is a
[SPEAKER_07]: predominantly pet science audience,
and my research focuses much more on the
[SPEAKER_07]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'm going to talk about the broader
impacts of why you want to study these
[SPEAKER_07]: microbial communities, the objectives of
my particular project, the methods I used
[SPEAKER_07]: to accomplish those objectives,
what my results were, and then brief
[SPEAKER_07]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to start off with background
information, when I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: microbes, I'm referring specifically to
the bacteria and the fungi living in
[SPEAKER_07]: forest soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the image that you see here on the
right is one of the forest plots that we
[SPEAKER_07]: used for my experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We used three different experimental plots
in the Bay Area, Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of them, just so you get an
idea of what they looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these microbes are really interesting
to study because they're able to interact
[SPEAKER_07]: directly and indirectly with the true
species.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the most common example that's cited is
the fact that microbes are able to
[SPEAKER_07]: mineralize nutrients in order to help or
hurt tree growth, but they can also do
[SPEAKER_07]: different things like mitigating soil
pathogens, interacting with trees in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that helps them to offer drought stress
and all different other types of
[SPEAKER_07]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But these interactions are also very
dynamic because just as much as microbes
[SPEAKER_07]: can interact with trees, trees can
interact with microbes, and they can have
[SPEAKER_07]: a significant role to play in the types of
microbes that are able to grow in the
[SPEAKER_07]: vicinity of their groups.
[SPEAKER_07]: And trees are able to do this by exuding
different types of root exodus,
[SPEAKER_07]: some of which might be a food source for
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some of them can also be
different types of toxins towards the
[SPEAKER_07]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this can be a very species or
taxa-specific interaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why would you want to study these
microbial communities?
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost for this particular
experiment is because of the applications
[SPEAKER_07]: it has for forestry.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is another image of one of the forest
sites that we used.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's showing some of the infrastructure
from previous experiments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this forest site is managed in part by
the Varian Forestry Department.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're very interested in the
results of these types of experiments to
[SPEAKER_07]: improve their forestry practices,
because healthy trees require healthy
[SPEAKER_07]: soil, and healthy soil require a robust
and diverse microbial community to carry
[SPEAKER_07]: out all different types of soil processes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another important implication is an
application to climate change modeling,
[SPEAKER_07]: which isn't necessarily what you would at
first think when you talk about microbes,
[SPEAKER_07]: simply because they're microscopic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in reality, there's so many microbes
in the soil, and they're carrying out so
[SPEAKER_07]: many important nutrient cycle processes,
that they can have a huge role to play in
[SPEAKER_07]: the overall carbon sequestration,
and then also the overall carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_07]: release and respiration of forest species.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the objectives of my experiment were
that I wanted to understand the influence
[SPEAKER_07]: of different types of environmental
factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So precipitation, things like temperature,
and then also tree species on the
[SPEAKER_07]: community structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I'm talking about community
structure, we looked at things like
[SPEAKER_07]: richness, which is simply the number of
different types of taxa that you have in a
[SPEAKER_07]: community.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about evenness, which is how
equal the proportions are at the different
[SPEAKER_07]: types of taxa, and then diversity,
which is sort of combination between the
[SPEAKER_07]: two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did this by collecting soil samples
from the forest site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just some of the equipment
that we've used to collect the soil
[SPEAKER_07]: samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the sampling scheme of how I collected
my soil samples I didn't do it personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a collaborator in Germany that did
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a graphic that's from another
paper that used some of the same forest
[SPEAKER_07]: sites in their research.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it shows the sort of sampling scheme
whereby we have three different forest
[SPEAKER_07]: sites.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's really unique about these
forest sites is that while they have
[SPEAKER_07]: relatively the same soil conditions and
temperature, they lie along a natural
[SPEAKER_07]: precipitation gradient.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so of the three sites that I used,
Arnsheim, which is pictured at the top,
[SPEAKER_07]: is the driest site.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we also used Frizing, which is also
called Fronsburg, which has a sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: middle level of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Baselberg, which in my site was
the wettest site for the experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they lie along a natural
precipitation gradient, and you can assess
[SPEAKER_07]: the effect of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another interesting thing about these
forest sites is because they've been
[SPEAKER_07]: managed for so many decades, you have
sub-pots within each site that are
[SPEAKER_07]: exclusively Norway spruce, which is being
shown with these trees, some sites that
[SPEAKER_07]: are exclusively European beech,
and then some that are a mixture of the
[SPEAKER_07]: two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you're able to assess the
different types of interactions between
[SPEAKER_07]: trees and what effect that has.
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to this, we also collected
other types of soil data and temperature
[SPEAKER_07]: data using weather service websites.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after we collected all of our soil
samples, we collected them from two
[SPEAKER_07]: different soil layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We collected from the organic layer and
the mineral layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also repeated the sampling
across several seasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we used samples from fall of 2017 and
then spring, summer, fall of 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil samples were dried before they
were sent to the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: We then, here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: in Cornell, we extracted the DNA,
we quantified the DNA using PicoGreen,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we amplified the 16S and ITS
regions of the genome to pull out the
[SPEAKER_07]: bacterial and mongrel sequences
respectively.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this DNA was actually sequenced
at Cornell Biotech using the Illumina-C
[SPEAKER_07]: platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so here are the results of my
experiments sort of in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an ordination plot, which to
briefly explain what that means for those
[SPEAKER_07]: of you who aren't familiar, ordination
plots is basically where you have a
[SPEAKER_07]: mathematics system in R and you sort of
input all the different variables that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: So temperature, precipitation,
the tree species, you can put all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: factors into this mathematics system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it plots all of your samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So every point in this graph is a sample.
[SPEAKER_07]: It plots it in multi-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't just mean three dimensions,
I mean multi-multi-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the program selects the best
angle to sort of look at this cloud of
[SPEAKER_07]: points, and that's the image that you see
presented in 2D.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the axes of this graph are sort of
imaginary.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're actually looking for when
you're reading this graph is clustering.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's really nice about this graph is
that you can right off the bat see one
[SPEAKER_07]: type of clustering, which is that my
samples are clustering by site.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the red is all the samples that are
from Arnstein.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the blues and the green, they're all
the sites from Tronsberg.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the purple is all the sites that
are from Bosworth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first in form is clustering by
site.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next thing that they're clustering by,
and you probably can't see it all the way
[SPEAKER_07]: in the back, but there are two shapes of
points on this chart.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are triangles, which is the lower
soil layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's circles, which is the
upper soil layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at least for Tronsberg and Bosworth,
they're clearly sorting by soil depth as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just with this example, these are
mostly all triangles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then these are mostly all circles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, our naked eye can't
pick up all of the different interactions
[SPEAKER_07]: and patterns that are present in this
graph.
[SPEAKER_07]: But luckily, there's all sorts of
statistical tests that you can use to sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of figure out where all those different
interactions are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the result of those tests is that we
saw differences between seasons in our
[SPEAKER_07]: samples that are related to the
interaction of the type of tree species
[SPEAKER_07]: and precipitation, and that this effect
was moderated by soil depth, which is to
[SPEAKER_07]: say basically that it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of different factors that are
going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably some factors that we
didn't have time to include in our study.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a couple of interesting things that we
found is that water tended to be less
[SPEAKER_07]: important in the lower soil layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: This sort of makes sense if you think
about it, because the upper soil layer is
[SPEAKER_07]: much more exposed to the atmosphere,
so it's much more prone to more
[SPEAKER_07]: significant changes in water content.
[SPEAKER_07]: And another interesting thing is that
bacteria and fungal responses also differ.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is the summation of my
experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been nice to go more into
what effect things like pH and nutrient
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis had, but we just didn't have
enough time to collect that data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is just a basic research
experiment to try to get a better sense of
[SPEAKER_07]: what different factors are influencing
microbial community structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the future, it will be nice to
figure out what the biological
[SPEAKER_07]: implications of that are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have lots of people to thank for my
experiment.
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost is my professor,
Dr. Taryn Bowerly.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's pictured in the photograph on the
top with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also Hong-Ming Suphros, who's my PhD
student.
[SPEAKER_07]: She helped me tremendously, especially
with statistics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark Kroewel, who also helped us out,
especially in collaboration with our lab
[SPEAKER_07]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Buckley lab for letting us use a lot
of their equipment, and then also some
[SPEAKER_07]: counseling.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Technische Universität München,
who worked with our collaborators in
[SPEAKER_07]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also partially responsible for
managing the forest sites that we use.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I have lots of photos that I took
from Wada, so thank you for those photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either this narrow thing, or I'd be happy
to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you plan to compare your results with
forests that are more complex facilities
[SPEAKER_07]: that take place in different types of
forests?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how you would, I mean,
I can't personally imagine as an
[SPEAKER_07]: undergraduate how you would go about
sampling a much more complex site.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because with all the data we took,
we still didn't have very great resolution
[SPEAKER_07]: about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would hope that eventually that can
be used.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that answer your question?
Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, today I'm going to be talking to
you guys about golf shoes and grass.
[SPEAKER_16]: Grass is a very interesting horticultural
system in that it's very versatile.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are many different forms,
sizes.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can have ornamental grasses,
such as zebra grass, or switch grass,
[SPEAKER_16]: or turf grass, such as blue grass,
fescue.
[SPEAKER_16]: They also serve a wide variety of
functions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here at Live Slope, we can have a concert
venue, or just a nice place to sit and
[SPEAKER_16]: watch the sunset, or we can have a soccer
field that needs to be perfectly flat and
[SPEAKER_16]: safe for the players.
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to that, it also presents
several opportunities and challenges.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really easy to grow in some senses.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nina might kill me for saying this,
but you could just throw it down anywhere
[SPEAKER_16]: and fill a void space.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it also presents challenges in that
you, in some cases, like I said,
[SPEAKER_16]: soccer, need to have a safe playing
surface that looks nice and plays well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Grass for golf, obviously, is very
important.
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone who's playing golf can tell you
that they're three main types of grass for
[SPEAKER_16]: golf, there's the rough, the fairway,
and the green.
[SPEAKER_16]: For a little perspective, the average lawn
is about four inches high on the canopy.
[SPEAKER_16]: The fairway is one to two, sorry,
the rough is one to two inches.
[SPEAKER_16]: The fairway is about four tenths to seven
tenths of an inch, and the green can be
[SPEAKER_16]: anywhere from an eighth of an inch to down
to a tenth of an inch for tournaments.
[SPEAKER_16]: To put that in perspective, that's about
two quarters stacked on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very impressive that grass can
survive in such tough conditions.
[SPEAKER_16]: The putty green is also considered one of
the more important places on the golf
[SPEAKER_16]: course because all the traffic is
concentrated there, and smallest
[SPEAKER_16]: imperfections can lead to the largest
mistakes on the course.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not only that, for televised tournaments,
it's usually where the camera zooms in and
[SPEAKER_16]: you get the closest look on the grass.
[SPEAKER_16]: This creates an interesting dichotomy of
function versus form.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can have a golf course that looks
pretty bad, but the ball can roll
[SPEAKER_16]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, that's not going to work,
but you could also have a golf course that
[SPEAKER_16]: looks beautiful and the ball's not going
to roll any way you want.
[SPEAKER_16]: That brings us to our key question.
[SPEAKER_16]: How do we keep the most traffic area at
the highest quality, both visually and
[SPEAKER_16]: functionally?
[SPEAKER_16]: FootJoy would like to say the Pro SL is
the shoe for this.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the most interesting things,
more recent developments in golf is
[SPEAKER_16]: plastic spikes are now seeing an
emergence.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not very well received around the golf
community, as you'll see, but FootJoy
[SPEAKER_16]: produced the Pro SL Spiker shoe that
hopefully can present this solution to
[SPEAKER_16]: this problem of traffic around the hole.
[SPEAKER_16]: As I said, it might seem funny that who
cares about golf shoes, but I promise you
[SPEAKER_16]: a lot of people do care about golf shoes
and plastic spikes.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's this issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: How are we going to solve it?
[SPEAKER_16]: For our experimental methods, we used
10-foot by 10-foot plots on both native
[SPEAKER_16]: and sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_16]: The grasses were used with hoa annua and
agrostis solonifera, which is just cooking
[SPEAKER_16]: bank grass.
[SPEAKER_16]: Both are pretty common.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hoa is usually used ... It's sometimes
used, but it's also invasive, but it can
[SPEAKER_16]: be cut down to a tenth of an inch,
so they use it anyway.
[SPEAKER_16]: The hoa annua was mostly on the sandy loam
native soil and the cooking bank grass on
[SPEAKER_16]: the sandy sand soil.
[SPEAKER_16]: We timed how long it would take to take
about 800 steps.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you do it once, it's within about 95%
certainty how long it takes, so you don't
[SPEAKER_16]: have to count 800 steps each time.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can just time yourself walking around
the same rate.
[SPEAKER_16]: Each trial was around 10 to 15 blocks with
three to six different walkers.
[SPEAKER_16]: The walking pattern was you would start
here, go there, go here, go there,
[SPEAKER_16]: and you kind of get the gist for about
eight minutes for 10 times over every
[SPEAKER_16]: morning, so a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_16]: The data we recorded was we recorded ball
roll using a palsimeter, which is this
[SPEAKER_16]: solonifty device, which levels the same
angle so that the ball will roll,
[SPEAKER_16]: so you're getting the same momentum.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you record how far from the end the
ball rolls.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully, you get a straight line.
[SPEAKER_16]: Impact testing using this USGA TrueFirm
device.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just pick it up, put it down, and it
measures how far the ball makes an
[SPEAKER_16]: indentation in the soil, so testing
firmness.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then we also did lightbox photos,
testing the canopy cover, the live canopy
[SPEAKER_16]: cover over the hole, and finally,
we did moisture, sunlight, and clippings.
[SPEAKER_16]: Clippings was just to theoretically
measure how much grass was growing each
[SPEAKER_16]: day, and then moisture and sunlight were
just extraneous variables that would have
[SPEAKER_16]: an effect on the growth of the grass.
[SPEAKER_16]: The results were pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish I could show you a
multi-dimensional graph like Tommy,
[SPEAKER_16]: but it's not really necessary.
[SPEAKER_16]: This picture kind of just says it all.
[SPEAKER_16]: I am actually this plot right here,
so this really tall, goofy guy who doesn't
[SPEAKER_16]: walk as the most beautiful manner as you'd
want, producing the least amount of damage
[SPEAKER_16]: to the grass, whereas this is a really
shorter, weighs less female, really small
[SPEAKER_16]: feet, just tearing up the curts.
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes to show that it's not so much the
golf shoe, but really the walker.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of what we got from it,
was that the walking style was a really
[SPEAKER_16]: big factor in the effect on the grass.
[SPEAKER_16]: Interestingly, Ho'e' Anio was affected
less than the Creeping Bank grass,
[SPEAKER_16]: as you can see here, the two.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still very similar, most apparent in
this one.
[SPEAKER_16]: It could be for a variety of reasons,
but that wasn't really deduced.
[SPEAKER_16]: Another interesting result was the
clippings actually increased with
[SPEAKER_16]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_16]: One theory we had was that it wasn't
actually due to the grass growing more,
[SPEAKER_16]: but rather because it's cut so low and
then rolled over, walking on it actually
[SPEAKER_16]: would stand up more grass, which would
lead to more biomass being cut off and
[SPEAKER_16]: more clippings weight.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, there's that dichotomy of
form over function.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this study, I didn't see it
through to the finish, but this was kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of a result that we got from it.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is very, it's a very
interesting preliminary survey of maybe we
[SPEAKER_16]: should be asking different questions about
what we can do to keep these golf courses
[SPEAKER_16]: from being damaged by golfers around the
whole.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I'd like to thank, I'd like to
thank Frank Rossi, Brett Welch,
[SPEAKER_16]: who was supposed to be here.
[SPEAKER_16]: He was the technician, Frank, everyone
knows Frank.
[SPEAKER_16]: Alec Moore, this was his thesis,
he's the mastermind behind it all.
[SPEAKER_16]: Chris Sicko, another grad student,
Amy Curlew, who I work with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also Carl, I'd like to give you a shout
out, sorry for not including you.
[SPEAKER_16]: I just forgot.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd also like to thank Leah Cook for
allowing me to transfer into plant science
[SPEAKER_16]: with little though scientific background
and every faculty that I've had the
[SPEAKER_16]: pleasure to shape my interest with.
[SPEAKER_16]: Besides that, some image credits and any
questions?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I should have included, but it was
actually pretty interesting, which like
[SPEAKER_16]: the round of the hole, we kind of saw this
pattern almost look like a bullseye and
[SPEAKER_16]: that was kind of due to like each step you
were taking because you're only really
[SPEAKER_16]: stepping in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess it might not have been
accurately because when a golfer was
[SPEAKER_16]: supposed to simulate like a golfer walking
up, picking up the ball out of the hole.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that could be kind of random,
but that was the best way we found to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was the shoe size.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was an interesting thing that
we did think about that.
[SPEAKER_16]: We actually did testing with a lab.
[SPEAKER_16]: Alec, I forget the lab's name.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in human ecology, they like strap
this up with all this equipment and like
[SPEAKER_16]: foot sensors, but I wasn't around to see
that data.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how much it actually shows.
[SPEAKER_16]: One interesting thing, though,
was this was actually Amy's plot and she
[SPEAKER_16]: plays hockey and one thing hockey like you
kind of like flick off and we were
[SPEAKER_16]: thinking that the way she walked when she
would turn around, she'd, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: like rotate her foot and that was causing
one damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it all the same shoes?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, all Pro-SO.
[SPEAKER_16]: These ones.
[SPEAKER_12]: We also tested Adidas, think of Nike,
but they were all the same kind of damage.
[SPEAKER_12]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_22]: So what would you recommend for a golf
player?
[SPEAKER_16]: For golf?
[SPEAKER_16]: So, funnily enough, I've never played
golf.
[SPEAKER_13]: Favorite part of this talk.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think for superintendents, it might
sound funny, maybe training.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to say like training, but like an
introductory, like when you're walking on
[SPEAKER_16]: the putting green, be careful.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just like don't avoid, you know,
like quick rotations.
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just say providing the golfers
more information, more awareness to be
[SPEAKER_16]: careful on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so as it was said, I'm Olivia Doyle
and I want to tell you today about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell internship experience that I had
in the summer of 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some information about the internship
is I was one of six interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 12 weeks long and I was under
the supervision of our very own Marvin
[SPEAKER_02]: Fritz.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the learning Mondays, every
Monday, where we would either go on field
[SPEAKER_02]: trips or work with faculty around the
orchard to learn about their own specific
[SPEAKER_02]: focus in research around the orchard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked in various locations,
including the Cornell orchard,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Lansing orchard, and keep still.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because I used this for my 4950
experiential learning, I had to come up
[SPEAKER_02]: with some learning objectives and
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one was to be able to create
an experimental design for fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: production and the next was data
collection in an applied setting and then
[SPEAKER_02]: care and harvest of fruit plants and hands
on field trips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope throughout this presentation,
you'll see how I achieved all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm dividing this talk into two
sections, kind of plant maintenance tasks
[SPEAKER_02]: and then research tasks because there are
both components in this internship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start off with some of the plant
maintenance tasks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of weeding of blueberry flops
and the cranberry bog, which was a really
[SPEAKER_02]: bog at the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cranberry planting is on the
Cornell orchard and you may not know about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just kind of getting started up
when we were there, but they were dumping
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of sulfur into it to try and get the
pH down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were struggling with it and
hopefully it's not running now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of thinning of grapevines that
were overgrown using handheld pruning
[SPEAKER_02]: shears.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thinning of grapevines is just
removing the secondary shoots so that
[SPEAKER_02]: there isn't as much crowding and it
prevents disease and shading of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Suffering the great plants is when you
remove the new growth directly from the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll show you a diagram of all these
parts of the grapevine in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason we do that is to keep the
energy and the resources of the plant if
[SPEAKER_02]: you think going into the grapes instead of
just the new growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the diagram I was mentioning
and these are the suckers down here and
[SPEAKER_02]: the shoots come out of the cordon and so
you thin to a certain number of shoots per
[SPEAKER_02]: foot or meter of the cordon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more plant maintenance hacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cluster thinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also cluster thin the grapes as well
as shoot thinning, which is where you just
[SPEAKER_02]: remove a certain amount of clusters per
foot of cordon to again prevent disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then removal of fruit and apple
clusters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apples grow in these kind of clusters
and these are a little late to be thinned,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they need to have some of the apples
taken off so that you can only have like
[SPEAKER_02]: one or two or three at max on the cluster
so that they can develop into full fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: without crowding each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some shoot wrapping of the
grapevines because it was supposedly
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be like hedged, but we didn't
have that machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wrapped tops of the grapevines
around the tops of the trellis and we did
[SPEAKER_02]: that at the Lansing location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of fruit harvest of
blueberries, strawberries, blackberries,
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peaches and cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are just some pictures of the
different crops that we harvested
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the research task section of
this top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We placed u-hooks around the trellising on
apple tree trunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what a u-hook is is this thing here
and the little hooky parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of go onto the wires of the
trellis and they kind of like the u-hook
[SPEAKER_02]: wraps around the trunk of the tree to keep
the tree upright and growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: direction we want it to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had to replace the rubber bands
that were holding them together,
[SPEAKER_02]: holding up the trees with these because
rubber bands are starting to strangle the
[SPEAKER_02]: trees when they were growing too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've set up lots of load tunnels over the
strawberry plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the load tunnels here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are for keeping water off of the
plants when it rains to prevent disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can lift up the sides of the load
tunnels to let out the heat when it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also spent a lot of time filling in
soil around potted apple trees and
[SPEAKER_02]: trenches.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was part of grad students' experiment
on whether or not you could overwinter
[SPEAKER_02]: young apple trees outside by submerging
their pots in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will show you pictures of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what the trellising system work
looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really see if there's wires
going across here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you look onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is the picture of the
trenches that you can see the pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is already filled in and here are my
fellow interns digging away.
[SPEAKER_02]: More research tasks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some hoeing under the great
plantings in the Lansing location.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was for a weed control study and we
had to manually hoe these parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: planting because the other treatments were
things like mowing the weeds away or using
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide or mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or leaving it as a control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by hoeing, we got to see what the
effects in comparison with the other
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also, in the Cornell location,
we collected weeds in square foot patches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took like little mini PVC pipe
square foot outlines and put them down on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would take a picture with a special
app that showed how much green there was
[SPEAKER_02]: and estimated how much greenery there was
in that square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would cut the green parts,
just the green, off of the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would identify them, separate them
by size, and then dry the weeds and weed
[SPEAKER_02]: them to get like a biomass kind of thing
for what kind of weeds were growing and
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: More research tasks were in the strawberry
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were like around 32 special plots
for this experiment where we would pick
[SPEAKER_02]: the marketable and unmarketable fruit and
separate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would count the berries and
weigh them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would calculate the average
berry weight to see what the different
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments yielded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the treatments were, you see the straw
down here, it's a straw mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it's incorporated or not,
it depends on how fruit yields next year,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a result for that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also harvested blackberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also divided these into marketable and
unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we weighed them and counted them
to get the average berry mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was, instead of looking at the
ground cover kind of thing, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at charlotting systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were looking at the charlottes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the strawberries, this is from the
manuscript of the paper that this research
[SPEAKER_02]: resulted in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Barbara sent this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is showing the mean marketable
yield between 2016 and 2017 when no straw
[SPEAKER_02]: was added and when straw was incorporated.
[SPEAKER_02]: This table doesn't show any significant
results, but it goes to show how much
[SPEAKER_02]: effort and work goes into getting even
significant results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we spent a lot of time picking
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some more photos of the marketable
fruit that we collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when it was all pretty and all the
yucky fruit was taken out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I was talking about with the
blackberry and the root charlottes is this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the root charlottes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, these arms are movable, so it makes
for easier harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an example of a plant to time
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in the high tunnel where we were
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it certainly made the hanging fruit
easier to access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some research tasks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we reported data, just shoot
diameter and length on root plants to see
[SPEAKER_02]: how charlottes affected their growth and
vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assisted in taking photographs of
microbial root associations of root
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is when you take a PVC pipe with a
clear bottom and it's drilled into the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a camera attached to a long
stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically my job was to bracket it
down centimeter by seven centimeter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that until, as they took pictures each
step of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pull it out, we want the next
hole and do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, images of these associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank Marvin Critz for helping
me get this internship and supporting me
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone else who has contributed to
my internship experience, including all
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who supervised me, and the
orchard management team, and the other
interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Parker McPhee.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfectly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And today I'd like to give you a brief
talk about my experiences with applying
[SPEAKER_11]: different concepts that I've learned
throughout my time here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_11]: specifically in plant science courses at a
upstate New York Bay Lily garden.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so just a little brief background on
the farm itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: The name of the farm is Slate Hill Farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's run by Craig and Mary Barnes,
who are two family friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I grew up right down the road from this
farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I always enjoyed going down there with
my younger sisters, my mom.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'd always take our dogs down there
so that they could run around and hang out
[SPEAKER_11]: with their family dog as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: This farm is recognized by the American
Hemorrhagalus Society, the AHS.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also organized an AHS display
garden, which was shown on an open slide.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are approximately three acres of
daily fields throughout this farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these beds range approximately the
size of 100 feet by 200 feet or so.
[SPEAKER_11]: On this farm, they also grow
organically-grown asparagus and garlic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also have pollinator gardens
interspersed throughout the fields.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so as this was my experiential
learning requirement, before I set out to
[SPEAKER_11]: work here, we came up with some learning
goals with Craig and Mary.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so these learning goals consisted of
learning and identifying desirable traits
[SPEAKER_11]: in ornamental plants, practicing proper
techniques while growing some plants,
[SPEAKER_11]: compiling a database of all daily
varieties of the farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was actually a very large project
that I had to part in with the owners
[SPEAKER_11]: throughout my time there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just general farming,
garden management.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so here we have just a couple examples
of some of the varieties that Craig and
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary have developed over their years of
working at this site.
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe now, after a few years after I
left, they have registered over 100
[SPEAKER_11]: different varieties of dailies at their
farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so just some general applications of
plant science class materials that I
[SPEAKER_11]: utilized while I was at this farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first and one of the most major
applications was learning and selecting
[SPEAKER_11]: for desirable traits, the variety of
dailies.
[SPEAKER_11]: These can kind of be broken down into two
different things, both subjective and
[SPEAKER_11]: objective qualities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so some of the objective qualities are
the scape fitness.
[SPEAKER_11]: The scape would be the stem that
eventually holds up the flowers or the
[SPEAKER_11]: seed pods of the flowers themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: The number of scapes is important because
that would normally, if there's a large
[SPEAKER_11]: number of scapes, you would likely see a
large number of flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're also looking for the number of buds
per scape, the size of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes you have these fantastic color
displays in different daily varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes they're very subtle.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the size of the flower can really
convey those sort of traits.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot better.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, some of the subjective
ideas.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're looking for vibrant colors.
[SPEAKER_11]: This can kind of be interpreted
differently by different people.
[SPEAKER_11]: This was especially apparent with Craig
and Mary, who had two very different
[SPEAKER_11]: techniques when selecting what they
determined to be interesting color
[SPEAKER_11]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_11]: Craig was always looking for very
outlandish, very intense colors.
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking for different color combinations
that he hadn't seen before.
[SPEAKER_11]: While Mary was looking for very muted,
very subtle colors.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was actually trying to breed a pure
white dailies.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so after I learned about these
different desirable traits, I then started
[SPEAKER_11]: making my own crosses and documenting them
with Craig and Mary.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this photo also shows the
documentation process.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every cross would be tagged and those tabs
would be logged into a book so that we
[SPEAKER_11]: would know the parentage of the different
crosses.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, the utilization of
organic farming management methods.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've taken several courses here at
Cornell, specifically with an organic
[SPEAKER_11]: focus.
[SPEAKER_11]: And since this is an organic farm growing
some organic crops alongside dailies,
[SPEAKER_11]: it was beneficial for both of us
especially for me being able to see the
[SPEAKER_11]: practical application of these things that
I had heard about in different courses
[SPEAKER_11]: that I had taken.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that brings me to one of my biggest
projects over this internship.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was a database college.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an intense, an insane amount of
information that Craig and Mary had
[SPEAKER_11]: compiled about every single dailies that
they had developed.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem was it was all loose leaf
paper, just information scattered here and
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I took it upon myself during my
time at Slate Hill Farm to compile all of
[SPEAKER_11]: this data into a very easy to read
database.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so some of the information that was
very important in this situation,
[SPEAKER_11]: the name and parentage, height,
color, and blooming season, the location
[SPEAKER_11]: in the field is especially important
because they would always have customers
[SPEAKER_11]: over the weekends coming in and it would
be important for them to be able to locate
[SPEAKER_11]: a variety very quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: The approximate number of scapes and buds
that would be likely to be seen in a fully
[SPEAKER_11]: grown plant later on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, the ploidy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dailies, they're generally both diploids
and tetraploids.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so breeding operation is very
important to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: crossing two of the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the next slide, I'll have an
example specifically showcasing these
[SPEAKER_11]: three dailies, which while they have some
similar qualities, there are some things
[SPEAKER_11]: that set them apart.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this is an example of the database
that I put together.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every part of this database is very
important, including the color.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every page was color coded to the primary
color of the flower, which made it very
[SPEAKER_11]: easy for them to go through and select for
specific things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then the name and the ploidy would be in
the first row, signified by either a C or
[SPEAKER_11]: a D.
[SPEAKER_11]: Their location in the field would be next.
[SPEAKER_11]: The height, their blooming season,
blooming size, their cross, which would
[SPEAKER_11]: also be important for AHS recognition and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then approximate numbers of scapes and
buds.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I left in walk Jake, I had not yet
fully matured.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this was not yet recorded before I
left.
[SPEAKER_11]: One other thing that I had deal with
during my time at Plate Hill Farm was
[SPEAKER_11]: daylily leaf miner.
[SPEAKER_11]: Daylily leaf miners are a small invasive
fly species.
[SPEAKER_11]: They pupate within and feed on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you can see here, generally they would
be, the larva would be laid into the ends
[SPEAKER_11]: of leaves.
[SPEAKER_11]: And over time, the larva would migrate
towards the root system, leaving a
[SPEAKER_11]: distinct white trail.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has been found that this feeding is
non-inverse to the plant and that the
[SPEAKER_11]: damage is purely aesthetic.
[SPEAKER_11]: During the time that I was working at
Slate Hill Farm, we were trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: quarantine as much as possible since at
the time it was a fairly new invasive
[SPEAKER_11]: species.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, since then, they have now been
found in all Eastern United States.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so quarantine efforts are a little bit
more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the actions that I took while I
was there.
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, we inspected plants and removed
any damaged leaves that were fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: We put them in a separate compost pile
away from any of the plants that were on
site.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I also consulted with the New
York State Department of Ag to get some of
[SPEAKER_11]: the information that I have presented to
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so moving forward, through making
crosses at Slate Hill Farm, I hope to
[SPEAKER_11]: register my own hybrids in the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: I made approximately 200 crosses while I
was there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the unfortunate things was it
takes daylily's two years to bloom for the
[SPEAKER_11]: first time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I was unable to actually see any of
my blooms while I was working at Slate
Hill Farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I've been in contact with Craig and
Mary to hopefully expedite this process in
[SPEAKER_11]: the next few years once my blooms,
or once my crosses end up maturing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then finally, I'd like to give a thank
you to Craig and Mary Barnes.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're great family friends.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've known them my whole life and they
were super supportive of me when I decided
[SPEAKER_11]: to go and work for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like to give a special thank
you to Jade, their daughter, Polly,
[SPEAKER_11]: who is my best friend in field.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a lot of fond memory.
[SPEAKER_11]: So any questions?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the example you gave was kind of
just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_19]: Generally,
[SPEAKER_11]: yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Generally, we see it mostly in the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's where the that's where the
robustness comes in.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is particularly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can generally hold many more flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may have just been that I picked an
example that went against that track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any special color practice that you were
giving before the process?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just generally taking
recommendations from Craig.
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually they had a long list of crosses
that they wanted to make, but they were
[SPEAKER_11]: busy as customers.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they would just give me a list of
what they wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just purely simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: We would take the male parent and we would
remove Polly from the male parent and
[SPEAKER_11]: direct them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, usually there wasn't any it wasn't
anything too intensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: In three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Laura.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as per my concentration, I've had the
opportunity to take a lot of classes that
[SPEAKER_07]: emphasize the importance of human health
in terms of current world issues such as
[SPEAKER_07]: climate change and global population.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as for that this past summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have taken a passion in educating
people on these topics and this past
[SPEAKER_07]: summer I've had the opportunity to do so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So today I'm going to talk to you
specifically about my parents and I's
[SPEAKER_07]: project in Southeast Pennsylvania to
reduce.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a little bit of an outline of
what I'm going to talk to you about today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to give you a background in
population growth along with food
[SPEAKER_07]: insecurity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to talk to you about where it
all started, who we are serving,
[SPEAKER_07]: the importance of this and future.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we all know, the human population is
expected to grow to 10 billion by the year
[SPEAKER_07]: 2050.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the population growth is expected
to happen in urban areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with these urban areas comes a lot of
poverty and food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that comes with because these areas
aren't able to take on the amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: people that are coming in at that rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have 805 million people who are food
insecure worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: 49 million of those people subside in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is about one in every seven Americans
is food insecure.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some of the potential solutions
to this issue?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we can close the yield gap.
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we do for that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do breeding initiatives,
GMOs, but as many of us know there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of stigma standing behind that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to mention CRISPR is a new
upcoming technology that we are all
[SPEAKER_07]: educated on that could possibly play a
large role.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fertilizer efficiency, but as we have seen
in the news, possible leaching can lead to
[SPEAKER_07]: mutrification and other ecosystem
devastation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my solution is the reduction of food
waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: So currently 33% of the food that is grown
worldwide is wasted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 45% of that is fruit crops and like
other fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: We only need 25% of that food that is
wasted to feed all 805 million people who
[SPEAKER_07]: are currently food insecure in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to show you the study,
but specifically emphasize on North
[SPEAKER_07]: America, 20% of our agricultural,
20% of food is wasted on the agricultural
[SPEAKER_07]: level itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm going to mainly focus
on today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So where it all started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing up, gardening was like a big part
of my family's morals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my dad decided to purchase a relatively
large hobby farm, a 200 acre farm in
[SPEAKER_07]: Jacksonville, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was originally a commercial potato
and corn farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we inherited it, well purchased
it, it was relatively like depleted.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil was relatively depleted.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my dad took on compost collecting and
over the past 20 years we have been
[SPEAKER_07]: rebuilding the soil or matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we currently don't really need it
for anything other than a large organic
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetable garden, well organically grown
vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we've all gotten older,
I'm one of eight kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this garden played like a large role in
our health and nutrition growing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of our food came from this garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we have gotten older, a lot of us
have moved out of the house and my family
[SPEAKER_07]: has found that we have a large surplus of
food coming from our garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even after processing it in ways such
as freezing and canning, that my parents
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't really comfort much.
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously wasting this food was a big
deal to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they started to reach out to our local
communities, see like how we can help.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we originally started with a place
called the Timothy House.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a drug rehabilitation center.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we noticed that the impact that our
small vegetable garden was having on these
[SPEAKER_07]: people in our community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my dad decided to reach out to other
local farmers and people who are in the
[SPEAKER_07]: same position as us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is our garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, half of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's relatively large.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as you can see, we have numerous
different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also plant lots of cantaloupe,
watermelon, strawberries, lots and lots of
[SPEAKER_07]: kale.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year we planted about 40 kale plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you can imagine, I was eating it
with everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is Reverend Gus, one of the
ministries that we reached out to.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually holding two of our heirloom
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very proud of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And us and local farmers were donating our
food to them where they were distributing
[SPEAKER_07]: it every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here they're feeding over 800 families
a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only are they like families who
are in poverty, but it also can be people
[SPEAKER_07]: who are underemployed, unemployed,
just having family trouble, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another way that we have donated is by
donating plants at the end of the season
[SPEAKER_07]: when it's no longer planting season.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually have volunteers who are
teaching these people to plant their own
[SPEAKER_07]: plants and grow their own food because we
want to emphasize the importance of
[SPEAKER_07]: growing your own food and nutrition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another way that we have reached out,
this is my little sister's high school.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started this project called the
Central City Project where the students
[SPEAKER_07]: are cooking and preparing food for local
street kitchens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then specifically we are donating our
food to this cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are branching out a little bit more
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Joe Bellino.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's out of Lancaster County in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_07]: My dad and him have become very close
friends this past summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And coming in contact with them,
my dad and him started reaching out to
[SPEAKER_07]: local vendors where they started donating
food that was marked by the best by they
[SPEAKER_07]: no longer qualified to sell in a food
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see here, there is lots and
lots and lots of boxes of food.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the inside, we have produce such as
corn and watermelon, cherries,
[SPEAKER_07]: and on this side we have foods such as
deli meats, deli cheeses, yogurts,
[SPEAKER_07]: really anything that you can think of,
along with toothpaste.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 40 other places that we are
currently donating to when they contact
[SPEAKER_07]: us.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just a few of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is this so important?
[SPEAKER_07]: So not only are we helping people who are
food insecure and reducing that,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we are also reducing food waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 22% of our landfills is food waste in
itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that contributes to $950 billion that
is lost as food waste alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also we are reducing the amount of
greenhouse gases that are being emitted
[SPEAKER_07]: every year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there has been a 300% rise in
greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of that is attributed to the
future.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I plan on expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be home this summer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like to open up and possibly
create a website for donations and to get
[SPEAKER_07]: other people involved, and also the
importance of education.
[SPEAKER_07]: So educating people in the community,
along with you guys, and showing you new
[SPEAKER_07]: ways that you can get involved and help.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are my sorts of questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have questions.
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_18]: So as I said, my name is Roxana Padilla,
and I'm a plant science major senior this
[SPEAKER_18]: year.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to be talking to you all
about my internship experience at the San
[SPEAKER_18]: Antonio Zoo this past summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to give some background
information first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to give three main reasons as to
why I chose this internship in the first
[SPEAKER_18]: place.
[SPEAKER_18]: So one of my main draws was being home for
the summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: I am from San Antonio, Texas.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really wanted the opportunity to be
home for a summer, to not pay for rent,
[SPEAKER_18]: to not pay for food, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was a great upside for this.
[SPEAKER_18]: A second thing that I really wanted to
emphasize was the opportunity to learn
[SPEAKER_18]: about plant care and horticulture design
in a public space.
[SPEAKER_18]: Prior to this summer, or before I started
the internship, I really was looking at
[SPEAKER_18]: public space management and that kind of
thing as to what I wanted to do after
[SPEAKER_18]: graduation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And the third reason was I wanted to use
the knowledge I had learned in all my
[SPEAKER_18]: classes thus far to apply them in a real
world setting.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the horticulture internship that I had,
had a very specific structure.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I needed to have 200 hours total of
volunteer hours.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also had a list of goals and
objectives that I needed to complete by
[SPEAKER_18]: the end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: And along with that, I had an end of the
internship experience writing assignment.
[SPEAKER_18]: So for me, specifically, I worked
alongside the horticulture staff on the
[SPEAKER_18]: grounds of the zoo.
[SPEAKER_18]: I also worked in the greenhouses that are
part of the zoo and at the Will Smith Zoo
[SPEAKER_18]: School, which is a preschool, also after
school slash summer school that people can
[SPEAKER_18]: put their children in.
[SPEAKER_18]: So they usually walk around the zoo and
they get private tours from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_18]: zookeepers.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they also learn about nature in
general.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanted to give some examples of the
learning objectives that I had to complete
[SPEAKER_18]: as part of my internship.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this isn't all of them.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like a snapshot of them.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a couple of them were outlining
standards of successful watering
[SPEAKER_18]: techniques, being able to identify
specific plants that are available in the
[SPEAKER_18]: zoo, talk about successful propagation
techniques that I would learn in the
[SPEAKER_18]: greenhouse, and my final major learning
objective was to create a project that
[SPEAKER_18]: would be beneficial to the horticulture
department as a whole.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would be coming from my own self,
and I would be working on that project
[SPEAKER_18]: throughout the entire summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: So my experience wasn't exactly what I
expected it to be.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the application and interview process
of this internship seemed very
[SPEAKER_18]: professional and put together.
[SPEAKER_18]: I had about three interviews I needed to
complete along with an application
[SPEAKER_18]: process, and I had a phone interview and
an in-person interview.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I figured it was going to be a very
organized and structured internship,
[SPEAKER_18]: which is what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it turned out to be not that at all.
[SPEAKER_18]: So apparently not a lot of people apply
for a horticulture internship at the zoo.
[SPEAKER_18]: So the horticultural staff didn't really
know what to do with me.
[SPEAKER_18]: I was mostly just assigned to a specific
staff member throughout the day,
[SPEAKER_18]: and I would just follow them around and
shadow them and basically help them around
[SPEAKER_18]: with their daily projects that they had to
do.
[SPEAKER_18]: So a lot of the work that I had to do was
very just hands-on, independent work,
[SPEAKER_18]: which was maybe mulching, weeding,
or making the watering around.
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, I spent 90% of the summer watering,
which was ridiculous, but that was
[SPEAKER_18]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_18]: So it turned out to be not at all what I
expected it to be.
[SPEAKER_18]: There were some upsides, though.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really enjoyed my time working at the
zoo school.
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the staff members that was assigned
there, his name was Charlie, he used to
[SPEAKER_18]: work at the Missouri Botanical Gardens.
[SPEAKER_18]: So he was very used to having internships,
I mean, interns that he would help around
[SPEAKER_18]: and explain things to.
[SPEAKER_18]: So he was very willing to answer all of my
questions and very willing to listen to
[SPEAKER_18]: what I had to say.
[SPEAKER_18]: He was also great at outlining what he was
doing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So he was aware that I was kind of
confused as to what my role was supposed
[SPEAKER_18]: to be in his internship.
[SPEAKER_18]: So he kind of really helped me to gain a
lot of things that I'm grateful for from
[SPEAKER_18]: that internship.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think overall, this was a very
insightful internship.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's just some random reflection
that I had.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the main takeaways I had from my
experience there was I met some really
[SPEAKER_18]: awesome people.
[SPEAKER_18]: So San Antonio is about 100 plus degrees
all summer long.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would normally be a very awful
situation.
[SPEAKER_18]: But the people I worked with were so fun
and so friendly and super nice about
[SPEAKER_18]: everything.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I didn't really notice that aspect too
much.
[SPEAKER_18]: I also gained a lot of clarity for my
post-graduation and career plans.
[SPEAKER_18]: And due to this experience as well as past
experiences I've had in my past four years
[SPEAKER_18]: here, I think I've come to realize that I
don't really want to pursue a higher
[SPEAKER_18]: degree or a career in plant science.
[SPEAKER_18]: But regardless, I'm just grateful for all
the experiences I've had here and for the
[SPEAKER_18]: internship experience I had at the San
Antonio Zoo.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think I also would like to take a
gap year to figure out what I want to do
[SPEAKER_18]: in the coming future.
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, I'm really grateful for this
internship and the people I met through
[SPEAKER_18]: it.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to acknowledge Jenny,
Charlie, and Donald specifically.
[SPEAKER_18]: They're the main people I worked with.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they were just super kind.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really appreciate them taking me
under their wing basically throughout the
[SPEAKER_18]: summer.
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I titled my speech, Living Moles as a
Deterrent for Infected Species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, in my arrive slides,
I wanted something a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling it Groovy Ground Covers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think ground covers are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's a lot of things that
they can give the people in a garden
[SPEAKER_04]: setting that we aren't making use of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the background of this project is I put
it out on Craigslist to advertise for some
[SPEAKER_04]: work, some life-taking work, for this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got in contact with this lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she had this house with this massive
bed that was full of invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she didn't know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She couldn't manage it herself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she needs some type of weed control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is also low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So she doesn't want to have to mulch every
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just some imagery of the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of up on a hill near Cayuga
Medical Center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of a shady site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see in this picture here that
there's trees all around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that you have to
consider when you're trying to choose
[SPEAKER_04]: plants for a site like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here that she's got some
existing ornamental plants growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you can also see is that you've
got weeds already swinging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in this picture, I've already
cleared the invasives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And left essentially an empty bed with
just a mulch in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that the mulch is really
doing its job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are actually invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just swinging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really needs something to take care
of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did is I started with a site
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've actually been taking some courses
in landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the first things I teach you is
that when you go to a site, you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: start by doing a site analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: An inventory of what's there on the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of a discussion with the client
about their needs and what would be ideal
[SPEAKER_04]: for the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went around and I looked at all what
was available on the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I obviously had many invasives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was one of the primary problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you also have shrubs and brush
hanging from the fence that you saw in the
[SPEAKER_04]: past picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just blocking the views of the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just bringing the property value down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's one of the things that we
had to consider when we were doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: project.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a picture of the site
analysis that I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't show this to any of my professors in
landscape architecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not really meant for anyone else's
eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's more of a thought process of how
I worked through looking at what's in the
[SPEAKER_04]: site and what needed to be focused on the
site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the areas of importance
highlighted there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right there is where an important view
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The view of Taiga Lake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this is an important access way
to their small apple orchard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also see that I looked at some
of the good plants and the invasives that
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be removed from where they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this picture is just, I made it black
and white because it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: This branch hanging down here that's kind
of, sorry, obstructing the view of the,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would be a million dollar view if you
didn't have that branch there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a whole bunch of things going
wrong with this site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I put this picture in to highlight
that sometimes it's just little changes
[SPEAKER_04]: that make a big difference in the site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can also see the fence and
this is where some of the invasives were
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, the slastrous, the oriental
bittersweet and poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So continuing with my site analysis,
I did a pH analysis of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also did the soil texture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lonely soil and you have a pH
of about 7.8.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is ideal for growing some of these
ground covers here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a variegated form of vinca,
regular vinca and acacanica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are some of the ground covers
that are actually growing on the site
[SPEAKER_04]: presently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, and these are some of the invasives
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we have pictures of the invasives
that I found and some really nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of you probably know these.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one in particular is a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's garlic mustard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kills microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kills butterfly larvae.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really a fun plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course you've got poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be harmful to the customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything here is harmful to diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's my proposed solution to the
customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suggested a complete removal of an
invasive species from the site in 2018 and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's already been taken care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I removed all of the species that I found
and then propagated a collection of Harvey
[SPEAKER_04]: vigorous ground covers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ended up only selecting one ground
cover just because of economy and
[SPEAKER_04]: practicality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was vinca.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was already growing on site and it has
some other characteristics that make it a
[SPEAKER_04]: good choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the other possibilities that
would still be good to use in other
[SPEAKER_04]: applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Acistema, Russian concrete, it's a
nitrogen accumulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clover obviously, it's a legume.
[SPEAKER_04]: It builds up nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: and Allegheny, Spurge, Pachydendron.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also a nice ground cover for
horticultural uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here's just some research that I
did to kind of back up the notion behind
[SPEAKER_04]: the study, behind this project that ground
covers can in fact prevent invasives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one study did find that by having
ground covers there to compete in the
[SPEAKER_04]: spring to be there even before the
invasives are there, like vinca,
[SPEAKER_04]: this evergreen, then you have,
they just, they don't come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never get a chance to see the
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're out competing by the ground cover
essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they actually found that vinca can
be alleopathic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that means that it'll release
chemicals that will inhibit the growth of
[SPEAKER_04]: invasive species and weeds, but won't
affect vinca.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also doesn't turn out to affect
some of the bulbs that she likes to plant
[SPEAKER_04]: in her garden, which is, there's some
hyacinth growing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a concept design of a
project that I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually includes some of the other
choices that I gave her for ground covers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it would be changed to just one ground
cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to redo this, but you can see
that I've drawn in several different
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so up to this point, as I said,
I've removed all the invasives and weeds
[SPEAKER_04]: and I pruned the existing ornamentals
there to kind of make them more of an
[SPEAKER_04]: appealing shape.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of talked with her about the
dangers of invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially it's been a little bit of an
extension experience to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: communicate to her what she can be doing
to help out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think this project is actually
a great kind of example of how through
[SPEAKER_04]: plantage through gardens, you can kind of
reach out to people and teach them
[SPEAKER_04]: something important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this project works out, we will also
know in the future, we will also know in
[SPEAKER_04]: the future that this is a great way to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In later this month we're going to finish
installing the ground covers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually being shipped to me right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't gotten to actually plant
them, but the bed is just waiting there,
[SPEAKER_04]: growing weeds, waiting for me to plant
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously there's going to be an impact on
the health of the site and it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be more aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously ground cover in the right
situation can look really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that nice feeling dark green
texture and color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can be really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously there's going to be greater
species diversity after 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you think about it, it actually
might be counterintuitive because if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're planting just one species dinka,
then isn't that less species diversity?
[SPEAKER_04]: But really when you're removing invasives
from a site, just a lot of invasives
[SPEAKER_04]: there, like for garlic mustard,
for example, its presence there is killing
[SPEAKER_04]: off like everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by removing invasives, you're actually
helping biodiversity just in the general
[SPEAKER_04]: area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there should be increased diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil is going to be healthier and just
the site is going to look better and the
[SPEAKER_04]: property value will go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a comparison of what it looks
like and what it will look like once it's
[SPEAKER_04]: completed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I finished off with this picture of
the hyzen because this is kind of what we
[SPEAKER_04]: aim for like, you know, getting rid of the
things that are unattractive and letting
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that we do want flourish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll open up to questions and I
actually want to thank Steve Riders and
[SPEAKER_04]: Nina Bassick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve helped me, guided me towards this
project and Nina gave me the soil test,
[SPEAKER_04]: the pH soil test and also taught me
everything I know about winning plants and
[SPEAKER_04]: invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to thank them both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll do questions now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I used, for the poison ivy on the
fence, I used Roundup, I swabbed it and we
[SPEAKER_04]: pulled it off the fence with a rake once
it was dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think some people are okay with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally, I tried to, you know,
communicate that it wasn't probably a
[SPEAKER_04]: terrible thing to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there are sources that say that
it can be bad, but I think that if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: being careful with it, swabbing it on the
plants, that it can be not helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there actually wasn't so much garlic
mustard originally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was more buckthorn and this
lacherous and that was the main problem
[SPEAKER_04]: originally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Buckthorn was annoying to get out of
coming here on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are serious weed roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I used a pickaxe for those and yeah,
I really went to town.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if I showed the
picture, but there was a huge pile of just
[SPEAKER_04]: debris.
[SPEAKER_04]: The horse garlic mustard, excuse me,
that is a taproot, so I'm just gonna have
[SPEAKER_04]: to use a shovel or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the first thing that sprang up in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
you
