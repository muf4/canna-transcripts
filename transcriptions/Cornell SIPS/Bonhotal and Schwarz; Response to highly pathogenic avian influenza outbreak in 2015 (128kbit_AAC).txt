[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work a lot with mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work a lot with composting,
with organic matter, at the Waste
[SPEAKER_00]: Management Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this last year, how many people
knew that we had an avian influenza
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak in the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you listen into NPR, they did have it
on NPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it on some other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in some publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't out there that that vastly.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 million birds were affected west of the
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't get it in the east at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have to deal with it in the
east.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were commissioned to deal with it
in the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or from west of the Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did lose 50 million birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 50 million birds had to be either
killed or they died of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't die of the disease right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, when we came onto site, would be
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there would be some half dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be some alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be all different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were we ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 12, 13, 14 years,
we've been working with APHIS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Animal Plant Health Inspection Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with them in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with them on mortality issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we have a disease outbreak,
we need to be dealing with that disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have a lot of carcasses
to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of options to get rid
of these carcasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they oftentimes lay around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there's a disease outbreak,
they can't lay around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, last year, was the first
time push came to shove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was January last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Push came to shove.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we need to get these birds
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to get them into, we need to
compost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the poultry farms felt that they
were going to be able to just landfill
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the landfills would take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'd be able to bury them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most cases, that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things did go to landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, the landfills don't
want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the people that work in the
landfills, there's fear that they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to the diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a disease that has jumped to
humans at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still a disease that's airborne
and can move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fear is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the landfills won't take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all private landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can say, you have to take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One very, very large farm with millions of
birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a Genio farm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Genio farm in Iowa?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the Center Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Center Fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Center Fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Purdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big ones that we recognize
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just got those big mobile,
the foldable dumpsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they say, just put all your stuff in
and we'll take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got those and thought that they
were going to get rid of them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And weren't able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come onto the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first one out in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a call from APHIS on a Saturday
night saying, can you go to California?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happened to be in Utah writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary and I were writing curriculum in
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next week, I flew to Modesto,
went into California, and met with the
[SPEAKER_00]: first farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked to the farms quite a bit
before I went in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have farm managers and you
have farm owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farm owners are the ones that are
financing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't know very much about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they want to have control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provided them with educational
materials beforehand so that they had an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what we were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we need to
compost is carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have carbon on the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just pile up birds and expect
them to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this situation, we really needed to
sanitize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're there to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to make compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there to sanitize and kill the
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we provided them with information so
that they knew what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to get carbon to the sites before
we got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all we're doing, we're not
actually, yes, we were physically moving
[SPEAKER_00]: birds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're there to direct operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: To let them know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to make sure that it's working
properly once they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking with the managers, they've had a
huge loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can imagine losing millions of
birds on one farm, they're affected
[SPEAKER_00]: mentally, emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one thing that we had to
go on the farm and say, OK, we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that it's really important
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to deal with this whole
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we could go in, we needed to have
full PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are disconnects on who wears
what, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I was wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of stuff that I was
wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had full PPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have glasses at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had everything else, breathing
apparatus, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm, this is the farmer up here,
had a medical gown on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the health department
provided them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said, can we get some PPE,
some protection for ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they ended up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a real difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is provided by APHIS.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get there, we're getting dressed
and taping everything, doing all that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers themselves don't have
access to that until they get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the health department kind of gave them
a raw deal in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually was in South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to turn it over to Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stand here so I can pick you
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you can pick me up without
her standing right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tim was talking about the importance of
assessment and knowing what you're walking
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I got to Wisconsin in April of
2015, this is what I walked into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had received some information from APHIS
about the size of the houses and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking to myself, we've been
doing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of birds before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew how to compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, OK, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take the litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll spread it out on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll throw the birds on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll throw some carbon on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is on a farm that has a,
it's called cage-free layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are three of these alleyways in each
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cage-free because they're free to
fly around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is 370 feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: These alleyways are three feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a door here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One door.
[SPEAKER_01]: One door.
[SPEAKER_01]: One door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in front, there's a small six-by-ten
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you could maybe wheel something in,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking to myself, how on earth are
we getting all these dead birds out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this guy's got five houses,
OK, with three of these in each of those
[SPEAKER_01]: houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: All are 370 feet long with one door.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular house, this is the
first house, there was 44,000 birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all dead when I got there,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the ones up on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think actually that one's still
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just hung out there, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got there on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they had died on Thursday,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and this is from the disease,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now luckily, they kept it cool in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't totally liquefied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were starting to liquefy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were still.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was still some stuff there,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just a liquid mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second barn, the second house,
had about 80% dead with 28,000 birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other three houses that had about,
I don't know, 35,000 each, there might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been 10% dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hadn't spread, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably wasn't going to, because we're
talking four days in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it probably wasn't going to spread any
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we've got to kill those other three
houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, we've got to kill the 20% in house
two that haven't been, that didn't die of
[SPEAKER_01]: the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of it, you can't foam in here,
because you've got birds flying up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you foam, and Gene will show you
some foaming later.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you foam, you're only getting here,
unless you can fill that whole house up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're in real trouble because
everything's soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've ruined your equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your birds are just boneless or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, boneless chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my nightmare, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my first time dealing with an
emergency situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I had the people that I got in
contact with as soon as I got there were
[SPEAKER_01]: well-prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fit tested me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me a person who knew her crap,
knew her chickens, knew something.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was very smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got all the PPE and everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the front of that barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all of the equipment,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to figure out how to get
the birds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to figure out where we're
going to compost, because we can't compost
[SPEAKER_01]: in the barn, because there's no space for
it, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about sending the workers
down like they would collect eggs in their
barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their dust mask, not even a respirator.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their dust mask and walking down
through the 370 feet to pull dead
[SPEAKER_01]: chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have to push a cart clear
away, pull them back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a health hazard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure something else out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we figured out,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I should tell you that I was
there from a Monday through a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we still had not started composting at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did build a test pile, which I'll show
you so that I could teach them how to
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we're talking those birds have
been dead a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other birds still haven't been killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are dying are liquefying,
are getting bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so as they're waiting, this is what
happened, and I apologize for the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's sideways, but it was taken
sideways on an iPhone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was that manure belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pushed the birds down onto the
belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came down into the manure system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then came out here, because they had a
manure system that went from each barn to
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a compost barn, where it was
composting manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we ended up building our
first few piles, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So using ingenuity and whatever they had
on hand until they did finally contract
[SPEAKER_01]: with a company to come in and suck the
dead birds out with a big vacuum,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, to get the dead birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then they had more trouble with
depopulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ended up having to suck out
portions at a time, and then use a garbage
[SPEAKER_01]: can CO2 killer, which I was not part of,
did not see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it was a fiasco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, you know, you make do with
what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should probably have had the other
one first, because this is a layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we compost birds, smaller,
especially birds, we can't do it the way
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene's going to show you with the turkeys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have a bed of carbon,
OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put the dead birds,
layer the dead birds, and their manure on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you cover with manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put more carbon, and then you build in
layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have back there some fact sheets,
so you can actually see the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first windrow that,
and actually, is there a pointer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, right here on this little corner,
you can see something that's raised up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the test windrow, which is in the
next slide that Becky and I built before I
[SPEAKER_01]: left to show her how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they continued on with the base
and built more layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ended up with three inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there were so many birds that we ended
up with maybe 12 more outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to get permission from the
Department of Natural Resources as to
[SPEAKER_01]: where they could put those piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that took some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of rigamarole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the maps to see where
there might be hydrologically sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or whatever so that you could get
approval to put these windrows outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of stuff that we had to
go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, this farm had 200,000
dozen eggs that also needed to be taken
[SPEAKER_01]: care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all in cold storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eggs, as you all know, are round and they
roll, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we tried to put all of those eggs
into these compost piles whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would roll out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, they're cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put a whole bunch of
cold stuff, which Dean will talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: later, too, in your compost pile because
we're trying to create heat because heat
[SPEAKER_01]: is what kills the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other problem with them was they
were in flats that hold two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: dozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them were cardboard, which is
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could compost that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of them were plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to compost those eggs, which a lot of
farms did end up composting their eggs,
[SPEAKER_01]: we chose not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to take all of those eggs on
forks, put them into a big truck,
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver them to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were going to compost them,
we would have had to dump them all out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their containers, break them somehow,
and then add them to the windrow as we
[SPEAKER_01]: were building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just not something that was
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did add feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had just gotten new feed for the
birds just before this hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, very little of it was eaten
because the birds were dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to empty out all their big feed
silos and put that into the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to remember that all of the
things that could possibly be contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: when you take care of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the teaching pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this shows just separate layers of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did, because I really wanted them
to do this right, was we built a two-foot
[SPEAKER_01]: base, which is what we recommend,
what CWMI recommends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would use less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know my two feet is probably
different than your two feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did was we built a two-foot
base, and then we put sticks in to leave
[SPEAKER_01]: two-foot clearance all around,
and made them put the birds in that
[SPEAKER_01]: clearance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we moved the sticks up,
and the sticks were like two feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made them fill that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you have a one-foot layer in
between, and we made them filled up with
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon to one foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they did that to all of
the compost piles, but I wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that at least the teaching pile was
done properly so that they would get
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate temperatures and get adequate
microbiology, or the microbes would do
[SPEAKER_01]: their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these birds, remember, these birds
were a week old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not quite a week old.
[SPEAKER_01]: About five days dead, six days dead when
we built this pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within three days, so they were cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't hot anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within three days, we had temperatures of
130, because we did build this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and that had a lot to do with the
amount of base and the clearance and the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, well, these are some of her
outdoor windrows too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are others.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm gonna let Jean go, and then I'll
have the interrupter once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in all, we really wanted to make
sure that we were composting indoors as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always compost indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to liberate the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virus can be spread on the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virus aerosolizes and leaves the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes out through fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans are always on in those houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hot enough that they can't allow
us to work in there without the fans on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depending on the time of year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this time, and this was April,
it still was too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really needed to have the fans on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another, I won't go into that
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just outdoor windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how they, some of them like with
Mary's situation where they might not have
[SPEAKER_00]: had enough indoor space to do the
composting, we've got to move them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to move these birds and the
eggs and the feed and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, this is actually not part of
our jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mary and I didn't do this as our jobs
because we don't have funding to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had funding that would have
allowed us to respond to an emergency like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were brought in by APHIS directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were APHIS employees for the time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carbon sources are tremendously
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make sure that they bring
carbon sources on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're writing all of the
stuff that needed to be written.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very large network of people
from California to Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are at land-grant
universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all sort of work on this together
and have meetings every couple years to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fun time, how about you all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, shavings, we can use shavings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often times on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're used as bedding already for
the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't give you the porosity that
you really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want chunkier material
underneath the chunkier the better because
[SPEAKER_00]: you need the air to be pulled under the
pile from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the heat pulls up through chimney
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really like chunkier material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to work with what's on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, this was South
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no trees out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really hard to find any
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, so they had the shavings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had some shavings they brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gray stuff up here is sunflower
hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sunflower hulls actually held their
strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had good porosity around those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could use those as the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air would be able to be pulled in
from the bottom of the pile so that we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have fresh air going through those piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these piles are turned in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all static piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want them to work by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we build them right, they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gray stuff up here is then this up
here is a hot pile of manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did walk up on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty good size pile of manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 160 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had good heat in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could use that if we needed to for
cover material and for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it would cook the birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would degrade in somewhere around
15, 16 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: All different ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see they get really messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have bad hair days when they are
starting to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see over here, these guys,
their feathers are sticking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only worked with turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary only worked with chickens as it
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was no rhyme or reason to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all different ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did bring the littlest, so the babies,
we brought in with the adults,
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they needed to get access to that
barn right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And APHIS allowed them to move them from
one barn to another barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The barns in North Dakota were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were good barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a lot better than what Mary had
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could play football inside if you
needed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really good sized barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, it was pretty ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had curtains, so they didn't have
containment really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were just curtains over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would have been curtains over there,
but they were open.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a train track right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a dinner train that came by
every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did have to change their process
because they were showing off agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did shut the train down for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't bring it by this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Modesto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well be looking at
agriculture, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of things in these
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we could use was bobcats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using the little bobcats because
the ceilings are so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waterers are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to dump all the waterers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to be pulled up so that we didn't
destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are misters up here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's it for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a pop-up pile of feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we just directed all
the feed right into the barn so it could
[SPEAKER_00]: all be pushed together and we could
compost all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of that stuff has to be
sanitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's on the farm has to be
sanitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we ended up having
to do with this farm was these birds had
[SPEAKER_00]: died from the avian influenza.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have to use any foam in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add foam to it, we're adding
thousands of gallons of water to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with two different
mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people had to get used to the fact
that this is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: These piles, because we didn't have any
moisture in there, any extra moisture in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, were extremely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we put the foggers on
in those buildings and added moisture to
[SPEAKER_00]: those piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the temperatures went up pretty
well because they were so dry that the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture was just too low for composting
to actually occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what they should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be long piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have any, you know,
maybe some feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even feathers, we want everything
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything has to be covered with
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have some kind of
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manure could be used over top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things could be used over,
other carbon sources could be used over
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to have everything well
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to South Dakota, what we do is we
have to take that clumped manure that's
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the bedding and manure that's
underneath the, the birds, because these
[SPEAKER_00]: are all on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could just take the loader and go
down the middle row and clear that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put carbon on top of that because
we have to have that air flowing from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put the carbon on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we took birds from the sides and
loaded those back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was controversy over whether we
should be making a mixed center,
[SPEAKER_00]: more like a Twinkie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have the carbon down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we should mix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would put the carbon over top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was, there's still controversy
over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We prefer the layered method because we're
moving the birds less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not creating a bio aerosol there
when we're, when we're working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we already have to move them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're already mixing with carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already mixing with the clumped
manure that's underneath them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 60,000 turkeys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we really should be
looking like, it should look like toward
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another picture that I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of material on the
floor, but the floor should be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, even though they're dirt floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the buildings that I was in had
dirt floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it should be a nice long windrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, you know, like I said,
we could play football in those buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a clean floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one guy that was on the
loader and he just would go sailing around
[SPEAKER_00]: all the poles and get it all off around
the poles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have to do it manually.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually able to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, a cleaning company
would come in and disinfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this barn, this barn was ready to
be disinfected at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's because we moved the baby birds
out of this one and into a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any rules for releasing the
piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when are we finished?
[SPEAKER_00]: When have we disinfected?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, I always thought in my
head, well, we'd be testing X amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six days, we'd be testing those piles to
make sure that we didn't have any virus
[SPEAKER_00]: left in the piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what the government was paying
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were doing was, and we do
this also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We regulate by process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York state, we regulate a lot by
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only rules that we have for
composting, one of the few rules that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have for composting is the EPA 503s,
and that's for biosolids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for human manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used those because we knew that we
could count on that because it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Virginia's had a lot of low path
AI that they've done some work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of their piles have sat for seven
years because the farmers don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence to say, oh, yeah, I'm going to
spread that on my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting should be indoors as much as
possible and outdoors with as little
[SPEAKER_00]: movement as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we leave the fans on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we should cut a big filter and
put it up on the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we weren't releasing, so that
everything was filtered before it went out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that never got any traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just aerated the barns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spread the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as you can imagine, 50 million
birds, it was spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some places in Minnesota,
where Mary was, in Iowa, we had massive
[SPEAKER_00]: spread in those states.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North Dakota, we only had two
incidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, we had the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other states, we did have problems
with disease transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a new outbreak this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an outbreak in Indiana right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about it being right now
because it is existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the birds are in piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only one incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everything was contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a high path farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was surrounded by a couple of
low path farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got that contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't had any more outbreaks at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were going into this in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, we have this phone call every
Wednesday to talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we have kind of an
exciting life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about dead stuff a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we had to deal with cold weather,
freezing birds, frozen birds, and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different to be composting,
to start composting at those times of
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that the windrows were
taller, bigger, that we weren't putting
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen birds in, that we had good chunky
material in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have to put frozen birds in the
pile, then we want to probably add some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hot manure that was out on the,
that was composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the lessons learned here is
that the farmers really have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have to be composting their
manure and their routine mortality,
[SPEAKER_00]: they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The routine mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they have practice, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have, they understand what
materials work and what materials don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they have the hot compost,
the hot manure compost on the farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can use that in a cold
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also can use other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf and yard waste compost, wood chips,
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hot in the winter, and we can
bring those things in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds can be incorporated into piles
frozen, but they're not gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: heating up until the outside temperature,
the air temperature, heats up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until it warms up, that's not gonna
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time we put roadkill into a pile,
and it was March, and it was five degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: out that day, and the pile just froze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were frozen deer, and it just went
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in a different situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pile started warming up in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to keep ice in carbon to keep
it cold, keep ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partially frozen piles can heat up,
so if they've already started one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have some heat in the pile,
it will ripple down the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done that before, and that works
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times we're doing these in
what we call the lasagna method,
[SPEAKER_00]: layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do them if we don't have all the
birds at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll build the pile here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're adding some other birds,
adding others in the winter through the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, or cows or whatever, and we're
adding those through winter, and it heats
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost covers could be used, and they
asked us that early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're considered experts, so they ask us a
lot of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they listen to us, and sometimes
they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at first, I'm thinking, that's just
another waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also can use those if we have to,
to insulate, to keep moisture in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also can do that with a biofilter
of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can put wood chips over top of any
of these and accomplish the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prefer to do that that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York, regulation-wise,
we tend to do that when we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When managing the frozen piles,
the clock starts when it gets to 110 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 36C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can say, OK, we need this much more
time, but that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that slide must have gotten out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a slide there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have dropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so what do we do after we've built
these piles?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking temperatures, or somebody's
taking temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the APHIS vets or somebody on site
will be taking temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we leave, we're there to build the
piles, to make sure they are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then somebody monitors, because there's no
sense in us being there through that time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 14 days, and this was being debated as
we were building piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 14 days, we decided that the pile could
be turned once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, if we've met the
temperatures, if we've gotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point, we were looking at 133 to
150.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had gotten that for 10 days,
then 10 days in that time period in that
[SPEAKER_00]: pile, then we could turn that pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do, or three days, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at 14 days, we could turn that pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we would do is, at that point,
we would turn the pile outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we've gotten those
temperatures, then we've killed the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that could be moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd move that outdoors to finish
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, it was sanitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we were trying to
accomplish at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can go in and take care of those
buildings and disinfect the buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in general, understand where the
farm and farmer are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take weather into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assess which are the best methods to
dispose of the residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the materials, the dead stock,
the feed, the eggs, water, all that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Develop guidance that's flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every carbon source is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got to be able to be flexible
enough to be able to accommodate and get
[SPEAKER_00]: the job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we more prepared than before the
outbreak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely more prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've discussed it when you don't
reach your temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are about 12 of us that are
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 12 of us from different parts
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of those were Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were bringing them down to do some
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I address that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the rule that we were going
by was actually an EPA 503 rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four bios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which basically says, in a static system,
three days at 131.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not static.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 131.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not per static.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the static is longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a time window, three days at 131.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Says that it is basically safe to use in
any situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we get Milwaukee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only rule there ever was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people just sort of use it as a
guidepost now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at all of the literature
on what is inactivating the AI virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's 130 will kill it in 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lower temperatures will take a
little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even at 35 degrees Fahrenheit,
it will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will inactivate within a week and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AI virus is very not stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it can persist in the fields,
in a pond, or whatever, for a long period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the water, it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different, but in a
contained situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you can carry it on your
shoes, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably more how it's spread than
the D trough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than the aerophiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if in the chicken barn,
five next to each other, only two barns
[SPEAKER_01]: died, that air had to have been going in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those other three barns didn't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what we finally got out,
it was sort of a case-by-case basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you ask more
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the answer in composting is 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you took it case-by-case and looked
at trends in temperatures that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching, as long as they were
thermophilic, so anywhere between 104 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 110 and 160, you were going to have the
right situation to get rid of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to inactivate that virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have evidence that at 90
Fahrenheit, we can inactivate the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of it, the sanitation of the
barns themselves only needed to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: two days at 105.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we treating the compost so
differently and making such a more
[SPEAKER_01]: stringent, you know, basically we were
more worried about the birds decomposing
[SPEAKER_01]: and there not being any flesh waste or
anything like that left when we turned or
[SPEAKER_01]: when we released the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LOHAP is always circulating in birds
almost always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes some distress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a couple of birds die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes ruffled feathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes loss of egg production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, a chicken farmer,
even one who has them in their backyard,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably has LOHAP at most times,
but doesn't necessarily notice anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high path is actually when you carry
the virus that's carried by wild birds
[SPEAKER_01]: into a LOHAP situation and the virus is
mutated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it becomes high path and it
almost always immediately kills within two
[SPEAKER_01]: or three days of getting the virus,
which is why we're not so sure that it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually is airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they say it is, because those
other houses didn't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going in, but the rules are
it's a reportable disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rules are you have to kill them all
and get rid of it because you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at a whole radius also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at a radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farms in the area are also checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backyard flocks are checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farms within three miles and 10 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have birds of your own,
you are not allowed to go out and test
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't want to bring it back to
your birds, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Studies, and I think actually in some of
those situations, they did put catchments
[SPEAKER_01]: out there by the fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were within, I think it was like
three feet of the houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they may do is they may just put
a, so to speak, a condom on the fan and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would just take everything to the
ground and put it through a biofilter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you deal with it there instead of
going further out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's either that or some kind of
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it could have more to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this definitely spread through the
migration routes and luckily didn't hit
[SPEAKER_01]: the eastern flyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
