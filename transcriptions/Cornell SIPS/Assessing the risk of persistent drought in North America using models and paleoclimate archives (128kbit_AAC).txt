[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when you give a talk, you try to
connect yourself to the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, the last time I was here was 15
years ago when I was skiing and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the last time I was here was
when I came in this morning and went up
[SPEAKER_00]: the elevator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it's really nice to be talking
to a familiar group of faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some work that's been ongoing
for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of it will be familiar to
those of you who saw my talk when I
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewed here in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was an eventful time in the
Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for the summer of 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the picture I took when we
were evacuated from the Mesa lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: which doesn't show up well, but it's right
here, in June during the big wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same month when a lot of
Colorado Springs was devastated by
[SPEAKER_00]: wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw the lightning strike that
started this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the top floor of the Mesa lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had office mates who had westward facing
windows and doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They opened up the doors to go out and
look at the big smoke because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the wind started to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started to blow smoke into the
offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the loudspeaker came on,
you know, the announcement that we needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to evacuate the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took this picture on the way down from
my bike on my iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later that summer, many people know,
be familiar with the drought, the wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it the Great Corn
Apocalypse of 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of what some of the
effects look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all this, end of the summer,
getting back after being evacuated into
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab, my advisor at the time,
Clara Desser, who's a climate scientist,
[SPEAKER_00]: works at Mesa lab, asked me, she knew I
was working on mega drought, prolonged
[SPEAKER_00]: drought, and she asked if this,
if what we were experiencing in 2012 was a
[SPEAKER_00]: mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I wanted to give a really
good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should have said, what I should have
said, what I realize now, what I should
[SPEAKER_00]: have said then was, ask me in 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because mega drought, the definition is
really dependent on this time scale of a
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonged period of aridity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question remains, people still
want to know, are we in a mega drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, when your position is
extreme weather during climate change at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell University, people ask you,
is it a mega drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait 32 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is current conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to weaken a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will abate a little bit with the big
giant rainfall events that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in the southeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The west is very dry, anomalously dry,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the definition, I'm using the
Wikipedia definition because I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: know who wrote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it captures a lot of what the
scientific literature up till recently has
[SPEAKER_00]: been saying about this term, mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you read it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned something interesting about the
world of the internet when I gave a talk
[SPEAKER_00]: at AGU a number of years ago about mega
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read my definition out loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, you can quote a professor
saying, that they constitute a threat to
[SPEAKER_00]: civilization if you are USA Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So graduate students in particular,
be careful what you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, that's an accurate
statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prolonged periods of aridity in the past,
and over the past millennia or two,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been linked to the demise of some
very famous pre-industrial empires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, does that mean they're a threat to
civilization today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just go over some other events that
are noteworthy because they have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: either correctly or not, they've been
labeled or attributed to being mega
[SPEAKER_00]: droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the Dust Bowl, which is about a
decade, six years of really bad drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: a decade total if you look at the average.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this, we've got the Palmer drought
severity index on the y-axis plotted
[SPEAKER_00]: downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the duration up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the size of the dots that I'm
going to show is the spatial extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these have all been events that have,
in some published literature, been termed
[SPEAKER_00]: mega drought, or at least prolonged
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia's Big Dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit smaller, a little less
severe, but still very consequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon drought of 2005, and also you could
add 2011 to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was similar in scale, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not very long-lived,
sub-annual, but it had a strong impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire and carbon in the area, as I
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry down a lot of the forest, and it was
related to, I think, a prolonged dry
[SPEAKER_00]: season, just a very badly timed wave in
the atmosphere that pushed out the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture for an extra few weeks leading to
the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's short-lived, very short-lived,
and big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big granddaddy of them all
is, of course, the Sahel drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was very consequential for parts of
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effects are probably still being
felt in the region today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this distinction, maybe,
that had been made, still gets made in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of high-profile papers on this,
between what we would kind of probably
[SPEAKER_00]: call drought versus mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the drought side, you might have things
like the 2012 event, short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it starts to get out to
being really impactful headline grabbing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very attractive to start calling it a
mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very compelling term to use a
drought that is having a very strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: visible impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there wasn't, I mean, the line is
very blurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the line is blurry because,
primarily, the term is a compelling word
[SPEAKER_00]: to use when you're trying to get grants
funded and papers published.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to be a little more quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually started looking at this,
even multi-millennial scale, periods of
[SPEAKER_00]: dryness in the Southwest, other parts of
the world, happening during the ice ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got thousands of years where
climate just dries up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those multi-thousand-year events were
being called mega drought in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, what, six orders of
magnitude in time being covered by this
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket term, mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about mega drought,
and in this talk, and in the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been doing, when I'm talking about
mega drought, I'm really thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-decadal drought, multiple decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything shorter, like one decade,
tried to call decadal drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot longer than a few decades,
and we have to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's driven by climate
change, either natural or unforced,
[SPEAKER_00]: but climate change, not necessarily an
interval that is dry for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: decades and then returns to being normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we're talking about events
that unfold, that evolve over multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, they're really at the edge of all
the decades of different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: observational, or apparatuses,
or methods of inference that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have historical records going
back thousands of years, and we certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have satellites going back for more
than just a few decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a schematic diagram that I put
together, and you can see the time scale
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and think of this as like the
quality of the data, the resolution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: data, the precision, is what I'm calling
it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for satellites, you've got a lot of
detailed information, but only for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instrumental data, the data is not as
spatially complete, but it's still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good, but you can't quite go down maybe in
all cases everywhere globally to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: high frequency end of the time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go down to days in most cases
with observational data globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there you've got drought,
and you've got weather, there's events
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move out to study mega drought,
some of the best evidence, and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about this today, it comes from
paleoclimate archives for the fact that it
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the very top here,
the global climate models you could say
[SPEAKER_00]: are legitimate on these time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being run with boundary conditions
designed to simulate the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: variability in the climate system over the
last millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're certainly able to generate
data on time scales of days all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: out to millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no problem with measuring the
variability of variables that are
[SPEAKER_00]: simulated by a climate model, they're
directly simulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are at best approximations of
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colleague who likes to call them
earth-like planets, these global climate
[SPEAKER_00]: models are earth-like planets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many, I'm glad I made,
thank you, three people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got climate change all the
way out here on the top, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: unfolding over centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mega drought is really right here
where you can try and use the different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of methods of inference,
the different data products available that
[SPEAKER_00]: are legitimate on these time horizons to
say something about the characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: these events in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got proxies, paleoclimate
archives like tree rings, instrumental
[SPEAKER_00]: data, and GCMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to show some pictures of
decadal drought, most salient example,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the Dust Bowl in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is April 14th, Black Sunday,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Sunday, April 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this wall of dust moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who have read the book,
The Worst Hard Times, have seen the PBS
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken Burns will be familiar with the idea
that the dust was killing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Infants and elderly people in particular
were very seriously affected by the dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused the type of pneumonia called
dust pneumonia, just from the inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really damaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to tell you guys this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I'm talking to climate
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1950s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture from the 1950s drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesser known, maybe not as visible salient
example, but certainly very painful for
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, for farmers and growers who
lived in the Southwest during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, after some of these studies came
out, I got an email from a Cornell alum
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that his family has been growing
crops in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the 1950s being really,
really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multi-year intervals of aridity that were
really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all in my bin, in my notion of
drought, the bin of decadal drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go 10 years in either direction
from these events, you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the same effects as during that
decade of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also lends itself to a pretty
convenient method for detecting decadal
[SPEAKER_00]: and multi-decadal droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just look at the
precipitation anomalies alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick your favorite drought index,
and there's lots of them, and they lead
[SPEAKER_00]: you to a similar story, but just take
precipitation alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here, we've got, in gray,
precipitation totals in the Great Plains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In black is a smoothing curve,
like a 10-year moving average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we've got one half of one
standard deviation, and you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the black curve stays below one half of
one standard deviation for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: period of the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a objective metric that lets us pull
out these things from data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply the same thing, and you can see the
same type of threshold applies to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Southwest drought during the 1950s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as a starting point, for a
definition of a drought that we know would
[SPEAKER_00]: be bad, would be as much of a
precipitation deficit that we saw during
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1950s and 1930s, this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of standard deviation in the
long-term average, the 10-year average,
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to identify these intervals and not
spuriously identify other intervals,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got precipitation, we've got
moisture, we've got tree ring
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try to apply this to a picture of
Connie Woodhouse right there, up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountainside in the, I think it's the San
Joaquin Mountains, in southern Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: coring a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to go out with the tree ring folks
once, only once, when I was at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Arizona doing my graduate
work, and I think I was able to core about
[SPEAKER_00]: three trees in the time that one of these
superstar dendroclimatologists core like
[SPEAKER_00]: 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was super sore the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go on these Swedish coring devices and
crank in, and it's exhausting work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe some of you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought I was really,
like, in good shape, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I go to the gym, and I go out there
and core trees with these
[SPEAKER_00]: dendroclimatologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're zipping up and down these,
like, 45-degree slope mountains on scree
[SPEAKER_00]: and drilling out cores of trees at a rate
that is impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, when I was at graduate school
at the University of Arizona, the
[SPEAKER_00]: world-famous tree ring lab,
dendroclimatology, was right underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: here, in the stadium of Arizona,
the Arizona football stadium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was persuaded upon by a good friend,
a good colleague, Scott St. George and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin Antikaitis, both of who had finished
a few years before me, to go and see if I
[SPEAKER_00]: could convince Dave Mikko, who's a
world-famous dendroclimatologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's someone in the room I know has
worked on with various papers and
[SPEAKER_00]: proposals, convince him if I could do a
study abroad in his office across campus
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dendroclimatology lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very convenient on a Saturday,
if you're working on a Saturday,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want some nachos, you just go
right across the hall and get your nachos.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the concession stand and then go back
to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, this is, like,
rich, woody smell in all the labs and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys that work there have these
big beards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you feel like you're in Lord of the
Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you feel like you're just
surrounded by ants or some mythical
[SPEAKER_00]: creatures that go out into the forest with
superpowers and bring back climate
[SPEAKER_00]: archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that I learned
about when I was there, I was very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in this idea of how well can we
make inferences from Turing data about low
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency variability in hydroclimate,
and how might that inform our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of drought statistics,
particularly mega-drought statistics on
[SPEAKER_00]: these multi-decadal, even multi-millennial
time horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go into the field in the summer and
make a bunch of, drill a bunch of cores,
[SPEAKER_00]: which look about like this, bring them
back to the lab, measure the ring widths,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they usually just get plotted up
to begin with as ring width measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even indices, just ring width
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just raw ring width from what?
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five, six different
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has been done to massage the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what you get when you get back
to the lab and you spend your time
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a very important step that
gets overlooked and has been overlooked in
[SPEAKER_00]: some very high profile, high impact
papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's how these things are aligned in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very quantitative, very precise
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sequences of relatively wide and
narrow rings are very good indicators of a
[SPEAKER_00]: time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like a barcode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be used to match where things
must align in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also very effective for
identifying places where growth is missing
[SPEAKER_00]: during a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be happy to talk about that after the
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main point here is that,
in this case, most of these actually ended
[SPEAKER_00]: when the tree was sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just count time going
backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the x-axis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw ring width measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, one then tries to model the
non-climate influences on tree ring
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important, going through it in a
lot of detail, because it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to our understanding of
mega-drought fundamentally, overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I fit a spline, just a
smoothing curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the ring width indices, to try to
estimate the non-climate sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, splines are said to be removing
100% of the variance at 2 thirds the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of the segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other more stiff splines might be
something like a negative exponential that
[SPEAKER_00]: models growth as being very sharp in the
beginning and then decaying rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ones still are more flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest and greatest best methods,
best practices for detrending try to
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate the growth from each individual
site as a residual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you factor in the total cumulative
growth across sites, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different methods,
and it's really important on the long time
[SPEAKER_00]: scales to get it right, or at least to be
able to quantify and understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're missing or what you might be
missing and what you're removing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because typically, you're chopping out the
low frequency end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're chopping out the low frequency
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for no other reason, then, in the
simplest possible case, a tree is putting
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same amount of carbon each year,
but because its radius is getting bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: the width of the ring has to get smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more going on in real trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biological processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They shift away from using resources to
grow towards using resources for
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all kinds of non-climate
sources of variability on these
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-decadal to century time scales that
need to be counted for or factored in or
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated if we want to get at this
problem of mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that's been done, you usually do a
detrending using those splines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine subtracting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a second step that's often applied
to standardize them to unit variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are ring width indices now,
not measurements anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been detrended and standardized to
be ring width indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a subset from one site,
I think in the San Joaquin Mountains as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, there'll be a few dozen trees
going into a compilation of ring width
[SPEAKER_00]: indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a compilation of ring width
indices, you've got tree ring chronology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I've done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for illustrative purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chronology is like a weighted average
or an average of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: constituent ring width indices via the
central limit theorem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to factor in in our
understanding of hydroclimate in trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that these sites have been pre-selected to
be moisture sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out to parts of the mountains
where it's very likely that moisture is
[SPEAKER_00]: the limiting factor on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go too high up, it's probably
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go too low, well, you're in cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the southwest, in this middle zone,
you've got long-lived trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moisture is the primary limiting
factor on growth, which gives you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: chance at being able to reconstruct
moisture variables, like the polymer
[SPEAKER_00]: drought severity index, like
precipitation, like Colorado stream flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those reconstructions now are derived
from sets of chronology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dozens of ring width measurements go
into making ring width indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ring width indices are then averaged
together to make chronologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronologies then are used to do a single
reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, via the central limit theorem,
we hope this all works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it might not work out the same way on
different timescales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that's an active area
of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of the Colorado River,
this is from Mikko et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007, the same Dave Mikko I shared an
office with for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reconstructed flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a percentage of the 20th century mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100% the 20th century mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very famous figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably one of the most widely
used paleoclimate results out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Observe flow in black is the 25-year
running mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thick black line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thin black line is the smoothing,
same smoothing, 25-year running mean of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray shading are the confidence
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is this event back in
the 1150s, among others, drops below 87%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 20th century mean for at least one
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in the case of 1150s,
it's about 11 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a great definition of
megadrought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to communicate that we're
talking about an interval that's
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized by an 11-year drop in the
25-year running mean at 87% below 20th
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20th century averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried that definition for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch of papers rejected with
that definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to simplify it, which is why I
introduced the other one that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually use for this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one event that satisfies those
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 years below 87% of the 20th century
mean in the 25-year running average.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the 1150s megadrought that's been
incorporated into a lot of decision making
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to use water resources in the
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just look at the point when
flow gets that same 87% threshold,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a few other intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have all been called
megadrought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call them decadal drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that 1150s drought qualifies as a
megadrought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25-year running mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can then look at other hydroclimate
reconstructions from the same region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here, just pull down all those places
that I circled before to show you these
[SPEAKER_00]: decadal droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're happening at about a rate of
one to two times per century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good benchmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at some of these other
reconstructions, this is the Palmer
[SPEAKER_00]: Drought Severity Index, also reconstructed
from trees, also for the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not completely in sync,
even though it's a similar region,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is interesting in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do get a similar rate,
one to two of these decadal droughts per
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Staley et al, 2011,
also a PDSI reconstruction from northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important, again, to notice that
it's not like these events are lining up
[SPEAKER_00]: in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is maybe an inherent spatial
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's information there that we can use
to try and understand the nature of these
[SPEAKER_00]: prolonged droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we go back even further,
apply a more rigorous smoothing,
[SPEAKER_00]: look for intervals that are below this
negative 0.5 standard deviation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: running mean, the 35-year running mean,
there's really only three.
[SPEAKER_00]: NADA is the North American Drought Atlas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives us an answer to a question
that a lot of people have been asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the first paper to address
this was in 1998 by Jonathan Overpeck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of my advisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their answer back in 1998 to this
question of how likely are megadroughts
[SPEAKER_00]: from a paleoclimate perspective was that
decadal droughts look like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring once or twice per century,
perfectly consistent with our idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1930s Dust Bowl as well as the 1950s
drought in the Southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decadal droughts occurring once or twice
per century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these multi-decadal megadroughts now,
multi-decadal megadrought, 35-year
[SPEAKER_00]: interval, 35-year period of aridity,
maybe one or two per millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rare events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these statistics seem pretty much to
hold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These initial estimates from 1998 held up
pretty well with our more quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up in the same ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to get at the likelihood of
megadroughts, we want to know something
[SPEAKER_00]: about the past from the paleoclimate
perspective, from tree root width
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements, term with indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to know something about the
underlying statistical characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroclimate in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really convenient tool, especially
if you're comparing with models,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the power spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically the color, quote unquote,
of the power spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've got time scale here on the
x-axis and amplitude, some hydroclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: variable, PDSI, stream flow, a red
spectrum is going to have generally more
[SPEAKER_00]: variance on the time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: White would be like a uniform distribution
of variance across time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue, which you don't see in very many
natural systems, but you do in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Earth-like GCMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great example of this is the Community
Climate System Model 3, so a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give you an El Nino-La Nina cycle
every other year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be El Nino-La Nina, El Nino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a ping pong ball being batted
back and forth from one side of the table
[SPEAKER_00]: to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're sampling that at an annual
resolution, you're going to get this big
[SPEAKER_00]: peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the Nyquist frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be like a blue power
spectrum, where the variance is pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the long time scales and
concentrated at the shortest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in nature, they're, I guess,
relatively rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people who do seismic imaging
have to worry about that kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're relatively rare in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a paper, a result from a paper
from Hoybers and Currie in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important, very significant
paleoclimate result, where they looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the power spectra of temperature,
so not hydroclimate per se, but
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, across several orders of
magnitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from seasonal all the way out to
millennia, multi-millennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking from Milankovitch down to
seasonal time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they argue that there's this just
general redness, steepness to the spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: slope that's positive for temperature up
to century-long time scales here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some inflection point,
and then you go down to more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nonlinear Brownian motion regime,
which is really potentially very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting from a long time scale climate
dynamics perspective, and may have some
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really just interested in
adapting this whole framework to
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroclimate, to ask if we could come up
with a similar type of diagram from
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroclimate proxies, and compare them
with temperature, to compare the power
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of hydroclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because presumably, if you have very red
power spectra, and power spectra that are
[SPEAKER_00]: red on long time scales, that would mean
something different about the risks of
[SPEAKER_00]: mega-drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'd be able to stay in a dry
regime for a long time, because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: high amplitude at the low frequency time
scales, versus if you have a white or a
[SPEAKER_00]: blue power spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing, though, that makes this a
little more complicated for moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil moisture, and other archives of
hydroclimate, as opposed to temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: is storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Hoibers and Currie paper is able to
get away with using very coarse resolution
[SPEAKER_00]: proxies, proxies that are geochemical,
that have relatively small basins to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about with mixing time scales of maybe a
few decades, or even a few hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if you're looking at the Kariako
Basin, you're worried about the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean, you still are only worrying about a
few millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going out to hundreds of
millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for mega-drought, for decadal
drought, we do have to think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: effects are we going to have of the
sensor, the tree ring measurement itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the distribution of variance,
the power spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a simple idealized drawing,
where you can imagine some white noise
[SPEAKER_00]: input being filtered through the proxy,
the tree ring width being a function both
[SPEAKER_00]: of annual moisture availability,
but also previous year's growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: in-situ soil moisture, a host of other
factors that are going to smooth out those
[SPEAKER_00]: high frequency fluctuations, and emphasize
the longer time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the simplest model that probably you
can come up with, one can come up with,
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and quantify this effect,
is this first-order autoregressive
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've just got your proxy at time t,
some autocorrelation coefficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: and noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can investigate this using the
Palmer Drought Severity Index,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a prescribed autocorrelation
coefficient of 0.897, from one month to
[SPEAKER_00]: the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not 0.9, it is 0.897, from one
month to the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can use that to calculate an
analytical power spectrum, and do Monte
[SPEAKER_00]: Carlo simulations of PDSI, to get at the
range of amplitudes that one could predict
[SPEAKER_00]: on these longer time scales, solely from
autocorrelation and a white noise
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's no other show in town in the
Southwest, besides weather, and
[SPEAKER_00]: autocorrelation, this is the power
spectrum we predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analytically, in this black line,
and with Monte Carlo realizations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gray shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very nice benchmark, then,
against which we can compare our
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of hydroclimate proxies,
in the style of Hoyberts and Currie,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydroclimate proxies now, in the
Southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up here, we've got, in the colored
lines, different tree ring
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reconstructions,
 all of them,
all available reconstructions of all
[SPEAKER_00]: streamflow variables, in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: All precipitation reconstructions,
in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a really pristine,
or really high quality, very carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed data set, that Connie
Woodhouse and her colleagues put together,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the five needle pines in the
Southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was designed to have the best
chance of preserving those low frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: time scales, by only using long segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the stage where you're building a
chronology, they threw out anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: was shorter than like 200 years,
or 250 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right off the bat, you've got a good
chance of having long segments,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are required, because of how the
detrending is applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need long segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already got long segments,
and then they also additionally apply very
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative detrending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to leave in as much of that low
frequency variability as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: while still removing the non-climate
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other archives on here are non-tree
ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the symbols are non-tree ring proxies,
from lakes and caves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the gray line is their average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some things that are a little
surprising, and some things that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: very surprising in this diagram,
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, is that, for the most part,
the tree ring records on these,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is about a decade, a century,
millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the tree ring reconstructions,
other than this five needle pine,
[SPEAKER_00]: very pristine data set, are well within
the confidence limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really significant result,
and a really problematic one for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that, for most of the stream flow
reconstructions that we have, the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence of megadroughts, of decadal
droughts at least, is not outside of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you would expect from stochastic forcing
plus a little autocorrelation in a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you have these other proxies,
pointing at a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there's some detrending
applied to these, and the variance
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping down here is maybe indicative of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the detrending itself is removing
variance in these long time scales from
[SPEAKER_00]: these other reconstructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the non-tree ring
reconstructions, non-tree ring proxies,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no detrending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all giving you this kind of
red shape that's aligned fairly well with
[SPEAKER_00]: the five needle pine database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the weight of evidence from
this diagram is towards rejection and
[SPEAKER_00]: rejecting the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it's not that the only
show in town is autocorrelation,
[SPEAKER_00]: stochastic forcing, and a bunch of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something more interesting
happening on these longer time scales,
[SPEAKER_00]: driving the low frequency variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject the null hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more data, we probably will have to
revisit this whole paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, it doesn't seem like we have
any reason to think that the variance out
[SPEAKER_00]: here in these proxies is driven by
something other than climate processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we want to do this purely from
statistics now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got different noise models that we
could apply, based on the autocorrelation
[SPEAKER_00]: or low frequency behavior of the
paleoclimate archives we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to reproduce their variations through
time statistically, and come up with an
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of prolonged drought,
mega drought likelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of these papers, where we just
looked at white noise, AR1, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: power law distribution, and frequency
power law distribution, to try and get at
[SPEAKER_00]: this long time scale, high amplitude tail
in the power spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really cool, I think, about this
figure is that the way that we constructed
[SPEAKER_00]: our methods, you can compare in time the
different types of noise models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on short time horizons of 50 years,
it almost makes no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting the same kinds of
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have the same exact variance,
zero mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: On longer time scales, when you were only
looking at the interannual fluctuations,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if I wasn't using gray shading here
to save money, the Journal of Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: publication charges, which are sizable,
even if I wasn't, you'd still be hard
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed to tell the differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you smooth, you look only
for the low frequency components,
[SPEAKER_00]: the power law distribution has this
persistence that really pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you stay away from the mean,
both above and below the mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: for longer when you're looking at the
power law distribution, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could be important for trying to
characterize the risk of mega drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, it matters quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just different PDFs,
different ways of looking at these Monte
[SPEAKER_00]: Carlo simulations to characterize the
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number of years spent in a decadal
drought, decadal drought risk as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of all 50 year periods,
experiencing one of these events,
[SPEAKER_00]: and multi-decadal mega drought risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really matters out here when you get
onto the multi-decadal mega drought risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the system were fundamentally white in
nature, if it was a white noise process
[SPEAKER_00]: generating droughts, you would have only
like a less than 1, I think it's like 0.4,
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3% of all 50 year periods actually had
one of these 35 year multi-decadal mega
[SPEAKER_00]: droughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: AR1, they become a little more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And power law, you can't quite ignore
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15% of all 50 year chunks have one of
these 35 year mega droughts in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a purely statistical
probabilistic approach to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, these two are more or less,
both of them, consistent with the paleo
[SPEAKER_00]: climate estimates of one to two decadal
droughts per century and one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-decadal mega droughts per
millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a consistency there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the final thing that we looked at
that we were interested in using to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to this question of how likely are
mega droughts in the future are global
[SPEAKER_00]: climate models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are they able to be run for
hundreds of years in standalone mode with
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary conditions set to pre-industrial
levels, which could give you a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: benchmark in and of itself, they also are,
of course, being used to assess and plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for climate change occurring from human
activities this century.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the crystal ball into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no reason to think that the
statistics of the past, whether these are
[SPEAKER_00]: inferred from paleo climate archives or
statistical models, Monte Carlo methods
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, we have no reason to think that
those should be stationary into the future
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're changing climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're changing climate very
significantly, there's very, very little
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to expect those ratios of one to
two per century for the decadal drought
[SPEAKER_00]: and one to two per millennium for the
multi-decadal mega drought to hold up into
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we need to look at the GCMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a requirement for trying to get it
right for this century.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone's pretty familiar with
the idea of a GCM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a global climate model.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will say about them is that when I
was at NCAR, I think in my second year
[SPEAKER_00]: there, the chief software engineer for one
of the groups I was working with was
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly put in his two weeks notice and
was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was recruited by DreamWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became an imagineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why did DreamWorks want a software
engineer from NCAR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DreamWorks is very interested in
computational fluid dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when Shrek sails off into the
ocean, they want the ocean to look
[SPEAKER_00]: realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing it in a way that looks realistic
means solving the equations of fluid flow
[SPEAKER_00]: numerically in a plausible way that our
own intuition will tell us looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why people like the chief
software engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group I was working in gets recruited
by places like DreamWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think they pull up a dump truck of
money and told them to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was part of why he
disappeared so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same basic set of equations
that one uses for video games,
[SPEAKER_00]: for Pixar, for DreamWorks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solved differently, of course,
in three dimensions on a grid across
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple layers in the ocean and the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does all the exchanges of heat and
energy and mass that are important for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole climate system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are results from just one model
running out into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've seen these kinds of
diagrams before, where you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: different RCPs, representative
concentration pathways, down here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Optimistically, if we avoid the worst
effects of climate change, we're down here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just burn, baby, burn, we're going
to end up on the RCP 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if you look recently at the most
up-to-date estimates that I could find on
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're actually doing compared to the
RCPs, people seeing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slightly, just a little bit above
the worst-case scenario envisioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're up here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line is, the higher the number of
the RCP, the more warming we expect
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's more radiative forcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very, I don't want to go
into a lot of model bashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love climate models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some serious limitations
that do need to be acknowledged,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly as they pertain to the
problem of mega-drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Systematic biases, very small ensemble
sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that because they're based in
physics, we can get away with smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: ensemble sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need 1,000 or 10,000 or 100,000
realizations of a GCM if it's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something dynamically realistic in the
flow of the fluid itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ensemble sizes are still very
small, and the natural variability is
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the systematic biases that could be
particularly relevant for mega-drought is
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are oftentimes too wet in a lot of
places in the Northern Hemisphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially in North America,
and even globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the total amount of precipitation
in the models occurring, just as an
[SPEAKER_00]: average in millimeters per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is GPCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the observations down here at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the models are a little too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that we published on a couple
years ago, a few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a distribution of variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is related to what I was telling you
about CCSM3, the old version of the NCAR
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are systematically too high
frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pushing interannual variance
around at very high amplitudes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that relates largely to the tropical
Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fluctuate between an El Nino and an
El Anino state not only too quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also very energetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you compare the precipitation
spectra, the power spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation from the models to the
observations, it really looks like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big difference, a factor of maybe 5 to 10
in some cases on the long time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even with those considerations,
and a couple more that I'll list in a
[SPEAKER_00]: second here, we went in, we dove in head
first and looked at these very cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: edge, this is still a very cutting edge
new area of paleoclimate simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, paleoclimate simulations
were done for, say, the mid-holocene 6,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, or the last glacial maximum,
where you're really just interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mean climate you get from a fixed set of
boundary conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last millennium, trying to simulate
decadal and multi-decadal and
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-century variability over the last
millennium requires a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: approach because you actually care about
the time evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, it's not a fixed, you know,
ice sheets here and Earth's orbit looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, it's a time evolving forcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got volcanic aerosols to worry
about, big eruptions from the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: solar variability, sunspot cycles,
related to total solar output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the gradual changes in the
Milankovitch forcing, the shape of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth's orbit and its tilt in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you put them all together,
these are our primary tool, and it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them all together, force the model,
and just to give you a sense as an
[SPEAKER_00]: animation for what it looks like,
this is going to be smoothed sea surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low-pass filtered, decadal,
sea surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up here at the top is the total forcing at
the top of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the map is sea surface temperature
after removing all the high-frequency
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to see some of these
volcanic events showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fast-forward this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get to the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This big 1248, excuse me, 1258 eruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, wait for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can already see, I mean,
this is decadally smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ripped out the interannual variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency of the forcing is very
abrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a delta function.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very abrupt forcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're seeing it propagate out in
these longer time scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just happen to have this century
here, where there's volcanic activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: one very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This scales to like 25 times the Pinatubo
1993 event, the very significant volcanic
[SPEAKER_00]: eruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to remind you, the power spectrum of
the proxies looked more or less like this
[SPEAKER_00]: in the slide that I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make the same calculations
from the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all of them, all the last
millennium simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-industrial, these are unforced,
but about 1,000 years long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last millennium simulations, there's that
reference line from the proxies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last millennium simulations only through
1850, so pre-industrial portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: last millennium simulations, and then just
the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's above what you expect from the null
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a model out there today
that's generating that level of low
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's dynamically driven,
it's being generated by processes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not very well resolved by the
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if it's a forced
response to the models, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: plausible, considering how much of an
impact explosive volcanism seems to have,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still not showing up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be important for
understanding of megadrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got the small ensemble
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come back to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you run four simulations with a model,
CCCM3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run four simulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get this distribution of some
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But truth looks more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to factor that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this in terms of megadrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you've got some shift in the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got two realizations of a
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first one, there's a megadrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second one, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mean is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variance is being drawn from the same
shifted mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you only have two realizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that mean the probability is 50%?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you undersampled the full PDF of
plausible future climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big problem we need to think
seriously about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last one, I'm not going to dwell
on very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's potentially a factor that we
haven't accounted for, which is that code
[SPEAKER_00]: has been shared between centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can have an impact on the macro
scale behavior of the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not necessarily truly independent,
because they have software components that
[SPEAKER_00]: can generate emergent processes that are
similar, structural similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our workaround for all these
considerations is we focus on changes
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the 20th century that are in
model, relative changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to use Monte Carlo methods to fill out
the PDF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ongoing work, I haven't really
finished, is trying to identify clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: of similar models and look at the risks
within clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can come back to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How likely, if you look at the GCM world,
how likely are these megadrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: And put it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different forcings are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: SCP 2.6, 4.5, 8.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making white noise assumptions about the
underlying statistics of precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get this increase in risk that's
primarily reflective of the southwest
[SPEAKER_00]: getting drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming down here, we're using different
noise models to emulate the statistics of
[SPEAKER_00]: the GCMs themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's this increase,
because when you saw before, you used
[SPEAKER_00]: power law as your generating product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the combined high forcing with a
assumption about power law distribution in
[SPEAKER_00]: the frequency spectrum gives you the
highest estimates of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is only applied to precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's decadal, so 10 year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making events like the 1950s drought in
the southwest, 1930s Dust Bowl look like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 80%, 90% of the realizations
seeing events like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then multi-decadal megadrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really the take home from
precipitation only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't even factor in the temperature
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got 35 year average giving you
conditions in the models that are as dry
[SPEAKER_00]: or drier than the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're emulating this with different noise
models, but in all cases, I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: say, we call this a very non-negligible
level of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30%, 40%, 50% chance that we're going to
be seeing a background shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waiting the dice towards making these
events, which historically, the
[SPEAKER_00]: paleoclimate view of the world,
have only occurred one or two times per
[SPEAKER_00]: millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this century, because of this shifted
baseline, they're much more probable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to finish here, because I need
to go teach a class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look globally and do the same types of
calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The US is just one pocket of the world
that looks likely to be exposed to this
[SPEAKER_00]: very high level of risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn the crank again, factoring in
temperature, and it looked way worse for
[SPEAKER_00]: most of these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in dry areas, when it's hot,
the demand for moisture goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes up with temperature very,
very dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that for the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 years in the central plains of
reconstructed PDSI and the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 years of reconstructed PDSI in the
southwest and in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really getting away from
megadrought, because we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about climate change at
the end of the century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the number one feedback
that we got from stakeholders and water
[SPEAKER_00]: resource managers after these papers were
published was, that's great, but I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use information about 2075.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't deal with 2050 to 2100 being your
reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's actionable now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really shifted my research focus
away from these climate change time
[SPEAKER_00]: horizons down towards decadal and seasonal
time horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even as bleak as this picture,
you'll see this in the next animation,
[SPEAKER_00]: looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown is going to be dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if we just keep on burning the
rate we're burning, or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the future we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as bleak as it looks,
it's not actionable enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to see things unfolding
closer to real time as they happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're focusing on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focusing on seasonal prediction and
decadal prediction and trying to get not
[SPEAKER_00]: at this long time scale, not at the low
frequency end, but really switching
[SPEAKER_00]: several orders of magnitude down towards
the higher frequency end of the power
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end there because I got to go
pretty soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's decadal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's probably, I mean, without
climate change you would have a chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one or two times per century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it looks like it's been getting
wetter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't assessed the Northeast yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the story of that drought because
my mother-in-law lived in New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: during the 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she remembers the signs in the subway
that said, save water, shower with a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, lucky people of the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on camera saying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we want to branch out globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think this is one of these cool
things about being in Langright University
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the methods apply wherever we want
them to, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have great paleoclimate
records, you can do a better job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if you don't, these preliminary
estimates are probably actionable in some
[SPEAKER_00]: cases for long time scales of water
resource management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for building dams or looking at
strategic aquifer reserves, that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the idea, ultimately,
to scale it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: More short term, more action.
[SPEAKER_00]: More actionable and scaled out to other
places that use water, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
