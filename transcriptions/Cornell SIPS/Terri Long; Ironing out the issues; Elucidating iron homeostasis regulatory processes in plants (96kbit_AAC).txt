[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that nice introduction,
Elena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you and Adrian for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for talking with me
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a great time talking with
faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to talking to
students soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Elena says, I study iron homeostasis
in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I study it is because
iron deficiency-induced anemia is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent nutritional disorder in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately 30% of the global population
suffers from anemia due to iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people obtain their iron from
plants due to socioeconomic and religious
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants can suffer from iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we want to try to do is figure
out why they suffer, how they suffer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how can we manipulate those responses
to produce plants that contain more iron
[SPEAKER_00]: or tolerate low iron conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in response to iron deficiency,
they undergo intravenous chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my favorite plant, Rabidopsis
thaliana, you can see, in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: that, dramatic changes in root growth and
development as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is doing this because it is essential
for many processes, including both
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and respiration,
where iron is involved in heme complexes
[SPEAKER_00]: and iron super complexes for these
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in response to iron deficiency,
plants, depending upon what type of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about, they can undergo two
different mechanisms, strategy one
[SPEAKER_00]: response and a strategy two response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dicots, like Rabidopsis, will undergo the
strategy one response in response to iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you do is that they
pump protons into the rhizosphere using
[SPEAKER_00]: this AHA2 or related proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then lowers the pH and then makes
iron become more soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ferric iron is actually the fourth most
prevalent mineral in the Earth's crust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so plants have to figure out a way to
solubilize that ferric iron and then
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce ferric iron to ferrous iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a Rabidopsis, then this ferrous
iron, it is then transported into the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermal cells by the membrane localized
transporter IRT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it travels from the epidermis
into the vasculature, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the xyleminates that moves from the xylem
route to the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we don't really recognize a
lot or that we're just now starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand is what's happening inside of
specific cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we know that there are iron
reductase that are prevalent inside in
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we know that FRO3 is involved
in reducing iron in the mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicosianamine is involved in producing a
type of molecule called Nicosianamine that
[SPEAKER_00]: will bind to iron in the form and
facilitate its movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zif1, for example, is another important
protein involved in facilitating the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement of Nicosianamine into the
vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot that's going on,
not only in the epidermis, but also in
[SPEAKER_00]: more internal cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started working on this project
when I was a postdoc, we knew,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that FIT was a key BHLH
transcription factor that controlled the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of those three genes that I told
you about at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AHA2, FRO2, IRT1 are all controlled by
FIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I was interested in is trying
to figure out what are some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: key players in regulating the iron
deficiency response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try to address this question,
we did a lot of microarray analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microarray analysis was the hot thing
to do back when I was a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's RNAC, and proteomics,
but this is the tool that we use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we developed a time course of the
iron deficiency response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at whole routes between zero
and 72 hours of exposure to iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we saw that there was a major
shift happening in the 24-hour time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we sliced the route up into
specific developmental zones, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: checked the endemic array analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at specific cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used fluorescence activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a slide about that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used fluorescence activated cell
sorting, which allowed us to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cell types that had been exposed
to iron deficient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that what we could come up with is the
highest resolution transcriptional profile
[SPEAKER_00]: of a plant route in response to iron
deficiency stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, my next goal was to
identify putative transcription factors
[SPEAKER_00]: and use a reverse genetic approach to try
to figure out, do they play a key role in
[SPEAKER_00]: this response?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that approach, we identified two
genes, which I'll show you, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of from the basis of my lab to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them we identified, and we named
Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Popeye mutants show decrease on
reductase activity and decreased ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to acidify the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called a bromo-cressol purple
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, as I said before,
roots will put protons into the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can image that pumping of the
protons that change in pH on this pH
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in contrast to wild type, hopefully you
can see it, Popeye mutants show decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere acidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grow a Popeye mutant on pH five to
six, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we grow it on elevated pH in
which iron is fully biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: available, we see that the plants will
germinate, but they won't grow far beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another example of the iron
deficiency response, decreased tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: to iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, surprisingly, Popeye mutants
exhibit an increase in the amount of iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the root and in the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that there is a
disconnect between the actual ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake iron and the ability to sense and
utilize that iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Popeye is playing some sort of role in
disrupting the ability to sense and
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to utilize iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try to gain insight into how it
might be doing that and the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms of how Popeye functions,
more recently, we've looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics of Popeye's activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my very talented student, graduate
student, Jury Shawar Muhammad,
[SPEAKER_00]: teamed up with Ross Sussani to look at the
dynamics and movement of Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that Popeye, when we make a
transcriptional fusion, it's expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly in the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pretty much see it in the vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at a translational fusion
where we can look at the protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can actually see that the protein seems
to be localized in all cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that the protein moves
from the vasculature to all of the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we teamed up with Ross Sussani to do
scanning fluorescence correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroscopy coupled with pair correlation
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, this is a technique in which
we can take high resolution confocal
[SPEAKER_00]: images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can correlate the signal,
the fluorescence intensity, across both
[SPEAKER_00]: time and space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this provides you with a carpet that
allows you to see if the protein is moving
[SPEAKER_00]: in between cells, so as is the case for
this freely diffusive GFP, or not moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: in between cells, as is the case for
another immobile protein that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: TMO5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we can see that Popeye, similar to
free GFP, moves in between cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, it moves indeed from the
vasculature to the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that now the protein actually
moves, we were interested in trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what that movement meant for
the activity of Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she cloned the Popeye protein in front
of vascular-specific, or behind
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular-specific promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: An endodermal-specific promoter,
and an epidermal-specific promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we identified lines in which the
protein stayed in those individual cell
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also identified lines in which
the protein moved from, say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vasculature to the endodermis,
or from the vasculature to the cortex,
[SPEAKER_00]: or from the epidermis to the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we wanted to see if we
actually expressed these proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially these proteins in a Popeye
mutant background, could it complement the
[SPEAKER_00]: function?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll walk you through this really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is wall-tight plants showing the,
and this is under iron-deficient
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, showing the classic
rhizosphere acidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our Popeye mutant showing a
decreased rhizosphere acidification,
[SPEAKER_00]: and poor growth under iron-deficient
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can complement those functions with
the full-leaf Popeye underneath its native
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we actually look at some of the
lines in which Popeye moves from the
[SPEAKER_00]: vasculature to the endodermis,
or stays in the vasculature, or stays in
[SPEAKER_00]: the endodermis, the actual Popeye will
continue to grow poorly under
[SPEAKER_00]: iron-deficiency conditions and won't
acidify the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we express it, when we look
at the lines in which Popeye either stays
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cortex and endodermis, or stays in
the epidermis and moves to the cortex,
[SPEAKER_00]: the common thing here is that the plants
grow better compared to our Popeye
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests to us that two things,
like growth, or a localization of Popeye
[SPEAKER_00]: within the vasculature or any internal
cells is harmful to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas when we have it in the cortex and
the epidermis, particularly the epidermis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant seems to grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So localization in the cortex is essential
for the function of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to try to gain insight to that,
we did this very, well this looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: very complicated Venn diagram after we did
micros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an RNA-seq analysis of some of
our lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we specifically were interested in ones
where Popeye moved from the vasculature to
[SPEAKER_00]: the endodermis or from the cortex to the
endodermis, vasculature or to the
[SPEAKER_00]: epidermis into the cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in trying to figure out
what is the transcriptional profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it different between the different
lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were actually able to identify a
significant number of genes that exhibited
[SPEAKER_00]: a stage range, even from off to on or on
or off, in lines, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which the protein moved from the
vasculature to the endodermis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this provides us with a really exciting
set of candidates that might explain how
[SPEAKER_00]: Popeye does what it does in specific cell
types, how it's actually able to do two
[SPEAKER_00]: different things depending upon whether
you have it in the vasculature and
[SPEAKER_00]: endodermis or whether you have it in the
cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that work is in preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're writing that up now and hopefully
we'll get some good reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the story that we're working on
in terms of Popeye's dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that may lead you to the question of,
okay, it's moving between cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what is it doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a BHLase transcription factor
based upon homology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first things we did was look
to see what are some of this potential
[SPEAKER_00]: direct and indirect targets using
microarray analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that many genes involved in
iron homeostasis as well as other
[SPEAKER_00]: processes are misregulated in the Popeye
mutant background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to point out here is that
Zifro and NAS, some of the three of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that I pointed out at the very
beginning of the talk, are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulated in a Popeye mutant background,
suggesting that Popeye might be repressing
[SPEAKER_00]: their expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then did ChIP-CHIP to see which is
another old school, would you consider
[SPEAKER_00]: ChIP-CHIP an old school technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's an oldest technique that allows
us to identify direct targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we used one hybrid analysis and
other various techniques, but ChIP-CHIP
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed us to identify direct targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that Popeye seems to be
directly regulating genes involved in not
[SPEAKER_00]: only iron homeostasis, but a variety of
other processes, including these three
[SPEAKER_00]: targets right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these three targets, so many known iron
homeostasis genes are upregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are directly targeted by
Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that Popeye is a transcription
factor, that is a BHLH protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also knew that most BHLH proteins form
heterodimers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will interact with other BHLH proteins
that will help control its activity as a
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we conducted a directed yeast to hybrid
analysis, looking at Popeye homologs that
[SPEAKER_00]: were closely, that had close homology to
Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see that the group for
that Popeye falls within the group B
[SPEAKER_00]: category, but that it actually interacts
with almost all of the proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really see 104, but it interacts
with 104 also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it interacts with several of the group
for CBHLH proteins, including ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ILR3 shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did biopsy analysis to confirm that
Popeye and ILR3 interact and they interact
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also confirmed that Popeye
interacts with some of the other homologs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we identified in our yeast to hybrid
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Popeye's transcription factor controls
many things, and it interacts with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Popeye homolog in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads to the question of what is
ILR3 doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So ILR3 is similar to Popeye, is
expressed, so here is a Gus
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional fusion of ILR3 under plus
and minus iron, is expressed specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vascular vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the protein,
it seems to be localized in all cell
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to Popeye, ILR3 looks like it's
a mobile protein that moves from the
[SPEAKER_00]: vasculature to all of the cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the phenotype under iron
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: So ILR3 mutants show decreased tolerance
to iron deficiency, increased chlorosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when we make a Popeye ILR3 double
mutant, we see a similar phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mutants don't seem to be
synergistic, suggesting that they're part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the expression of ILR3 in
a Popeye mutant background, it seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated, suggesting that Popeye might be
upstream of ILR3 in facilitating its
[SPEAKER_00]: repression.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we look at co-expression
analysis, we see that Popeye is
[SPEAKER_00]: co-expressed with many of the well-known
iron homeostasis genes, including FRO3,
[SPEAKER_00]: BLH101,
[SPEAKER_00]: NAS4, these are all well-known iron
homeostasis genes that Popeye is
[SPEAKER_00]: co-regulated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ILR3 is not co-regulated with
well-known iron homeostasis genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggested that maybe ILR3,
although it plays a role in iron
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis, it plays a role in something
else as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Siobhan Brady and Daniel Klebenstein
had been doing a really extensive yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: one-hybrid screening of still-specific
transcription factors, and they found that
[SPEAKER_00]: ILR3 binds to the promoter of many genes
involving glucosinolates, so over half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the transcription factors involved in the
synthesis of enzymes involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate synthesis are bound to and
controlled by ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we picked several of the enzymes that
seem to be mis-expressed both in Popeye as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as ILR3 and checked their expression
in the background of the single mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: and the double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we indeed found that Popeye seems to
have the opposite effect on the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of these genes compared to ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, MAM1, which is a key
enzyme involved in the first step in
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate synthesis, in a Popeye
mutant background, the expression goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down compared to wild-type, but the
expression goes up, and ILR3 suggesting
[SPEAKER_00]: that Popeye might be involved in the
activation of MAM1, whereas ILR3 is
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in repression of MAM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they seem to have opposing roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we teamed up with Daniel
Klebenstein, who is the glucosinolate guru
[SPEAKER_00]: and we measured glucosinolate responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results were not as clear-cut as I
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to see, you know, clear-cut up
and down for ILR3 and Popeye, but what we
[SPEAKER_00]: did find is that there were effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that ILR3 did seem to grow up in
both, in the roots, in both, we found that
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate did seem to grow up in an
ILR3 mutant background in both the double
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants as well as the individual mutants,
particularly in the root, and we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: see as dramatic of effect on ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the Popeye mutant background,
we also saw that these effects were
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat iron deficiency dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that ILR3 and Popeye act
in an opposing way to modulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis of glucosinolates under iron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if this had any biological and
physiological relevance at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: we teamed up with Eric Davis, who is a
plant pathologist who works on cyst
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and soybeans, and so,
which also affects the rhabaropsis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we checked the expression of ILR3 with
our gust lines under plus and minus iron
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same age plants as what we normally
used to look at cyst measurements,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at cyst infections, and then we
infected both iron-sufficient and
[SPEAKER_00]: iron-deficient plants, or plants that have
been grown under these conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cyst nematode, and we were able to
see that under iron sufficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if we can see an increase in the
activity or an expression of ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that somehow the cyst
infection induces an expression of this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we actually quantify the actual
infection of the cyst nematode of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were exposed to both plus and minus
iron in both Popeye mutant, ILR3 mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the double mutant background,
and we found that indeed there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in the infection rate in the ILR3
and the double mutant background,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that the increase in the amount
of glucosinolates contributes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased infection of cyst nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we picked cyst nematodes because
they're wounding plants and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because they're wounding pathogens,
and glucosinolates are induced in response
[SPEAKER_00]: to wounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm going kind of fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys started at 1220, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to 1230.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, 10 minutes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't be 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so yes, Popeye and ILR3 seem to
play this opposing role potentially in
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate synthesis, perhaps in
response to iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the model that I published is that
Popeye controls ILR3, and ILR3 plays this
[SPEAKER_00]: role in both iron homeostasis and in
glucosinolates, whereas Popeye is
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling other things in addition to
ILR3 that plays an overall role in iron
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's kind of illustrated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we were able to add
Popeye to this regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that Popeye seems to be directly
repressing genes that play a known role in
[SPEAKER_00]: iron homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can add to this network also that
Popeye directly interacts with several
[SPEAKER_00]: homologs, including ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also keep in mind that Popeye
is a mobile protein that plays a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling iron homeostasis, even though
it seems to disconnect the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: sense and utilize that iron that's inside
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we add on to this, we layer on to this
this fact that Popeye seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: repressing ILR3, which plays a role in
repressing glucosinolate synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somehow this interplay modulates
glucosinolate synthesis under iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've spent the majority of this time
talking about the first gene that we
[SPEAKER_00]: identified, which was Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second gene that we identified
during this initial screen was a gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: we named Brutus, because in contrast to
Popeye, Brutus mutants grow better than
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type under iron deficiency
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have Brutus versus Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, and as you can see here,
when we look at rhizosphere acidification,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a dramatic increase in ability to
acidify the rhizosphere, which can help to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain why the plants grow better under
iron deficiency conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my graduate student Rosalind Samir made
a Brutus promoter transcriptional gust
[SPEAKER_00]: fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that indeed the gene seems
to be induced in response to iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the shoes, however,
it seems to be, in our hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutively expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at floral tissues and
reproductive tissues, we see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutively expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see that the expression seems
to fade out over time as the leaves reach
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really intrigued by this
expression pattern and suggested that
[SPEAKER_00]: Brutus might play some potential role in
loading iron into the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was particularly interesting
because we also knew that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: embryo lethal alleles of Brutus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of our Brutus alleles
that we've identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the embryo lethal alleles
suggested that perhaps this role,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brutus, it has substantiated the idea that
Brutus is playing some sort of role in
[SPEAKER_00]: loading iron into the seed during
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these alleles show a rest at two
different stages of embryo development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went back to all these alleles
and we looked at embryo lethality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that Brutus alleles do show
an increase in embryo lethality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measured the amount of iron that
was associated with the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that both iron and zinc are
elevated in these Brutus mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually visualize this when we
stain using pearl staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that loss of Brutus
function leads to an increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of iron in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this leads to arrested
development during embryogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it suggests that Brutus represses iron
uptake, makes sure that we don't have too
[SPEAKER_00]: much iron that's transported into the
developing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how's Brutus able to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of protein is it in code?
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, initially, we were looking for
transcription factors in our initial
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled this out because it had a
CHY, zinc finger DNA, potential DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: binding domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really excited about this and I
presented it at that meeting and Jose was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, why are you focusing on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be focusing on this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking more at these other
interesting domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that I'll talk about first is this
E3 domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So E3 ligases actually facilitate the
ubiquitination of target proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it pairs up with E1, E2, and then this
E3 will actually cause ubiquitin molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: to be transferred from E2 to the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's tagged with multiple
ubiquitin chains, it's targeted for
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation by the 26S proteasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we tried, in order to figure out
what Brutus might be facilitating the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation of, we conducted non-biased
yeast to hybrid screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pulled out, we made a cDNA library
of the root and we tried to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: things that Brutus might be interacting
with from this library using this yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found that Brutus interacted
with several proteins, two of which were
[SPEAKER_00]: the same family of proteins that Popeye
physically interacted with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I had a story where you have Brutus
and Popeye, they actually might be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be playing a role together in
this whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we went back and we checked to see
if Brutus and Popeye interact,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do not interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Popeye, however, Brutus does
interact with Popeye homologues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and we did biFC and we saw
that Brutus interacted, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: with ILR3, but Brutus does not interact
with Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just showing you biFC in the
Christiana Bifidiana samples in which
[SPEAKER_00]: we're expressing RFP fused to a nuclear
tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a green signal paired with
the red signal, you know that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting at the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we also confirmed this with
co-immunoprecipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you remove the E3 domain,
you lose the interaction between Brutus
[SPEAKER_00]: and ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here as well as in our
co-IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggested Brutus's interaction with
the Popeye-like proteins requires the E3
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the next step was to show that
Brutus is actually indeed enzymatically an
[SPEAKER_00]: E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this we used in vitro
ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person who did this, and I'm
sorry, I don't have his picture here,
[SPEAKER_00]: very talented postdoc, Devarshe Saloti,
who was actually a postdoc in Olena's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I managed to, I was grateful that I was
able to recruit Dev because Dev was
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brutus is a really tough protein to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any data that he brought in,
Dev was really the Brutus I was always
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about because no one else had his
hands to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what this is an in vitro
ubiquitination assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to notice is that when
you have your E1 and your E2 Brutus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for the formation of
ubiquitin tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see that when,
am I getting ahead of my house a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm getting a little bit ahead of
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want you to focus on is that you
can actually see the formation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitin tags here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting that it is, and I'll explain
the rest of this in a few slides right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw that it actually seems to
actually form these ubiquitin chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we remove the E3, you see a loss
of the formation of these poly ubiquitin
[SPEAKER_00]: chains, suggesting that it is an E3
ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do cell-free degradation
assays, we can see that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see the accumulation of ILR3 in a Brutus
mutant background, but not in wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and this all seemed to be
reliant upon the presence of NT132,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that Brutus is indeed
facilitating degradation of ILR3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also see this in vivo when we
look at the presence of ILR3 translation
[SPEAKER_00]: of Brutus in a Brutus mutant background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have evidence that Brutus is
indeed an E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about these other domains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are hemorrhythmic domains that in
mammalian cells have been shown to bind
[SPEAKER_00]: iron in these oxygen pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a potential iron binding motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to figure out if Brutus indeed
directly bonds iron, we purify the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a maltose-binding protein,
his tag version of Brutus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we made another version when we
removed the hemorrhythmic domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can look at the ICPM aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a dramatic decrease in the amount
of iron and zinc associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemorrhythmic domains, suggesting that
Brutus does facilitate interaction with
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, or that Brutus binds iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but the really cool thing is that when
we in vitro transcribe and translated the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein in the presence of increasing
amounts of soluble iron, we see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein goes away, suggesting that it's
destabilized in the presence of increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we remove the hemorrhythm domain,
remove this entire chunk, we see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein remains stable in increasing
amounts of soluble iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that the bonding of iron
facilitates the degradation of Brutus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also gratified to see that
when we look at our Brutus hemorrhythm
[SPEAKER_00]: domain, we can see the protein is much
more stabilized, it's much more prevalent
[SPEAKER_00]: than the full-length protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much more prevalent than when you
remove the E3 domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hemorrhythm domain is not only
responsible for binding on, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the stabilization of the
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll go back to this image,
and you can see in the presence of E1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: E2, when you remove the hemorrhythm
domain, you see a much more dramatic
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the amount of monoubiquitin
chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggests that the stabilized version
of the protein is really strongly in E3
[SPEAKER_00]: ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, when you remove the
hemorrhythm domain, it acts very much like
[SPEAKER_00]: wall type in that ILR3 is no longer
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can add to this model the idea
that Brutus is interacting with these Papa
[SPEAKER_00]: homologs and facilitating their
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think this might be doing is in
the absence of iron, you see an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the amount of Brutus that's
transcriptionally induced to the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the plant gets sufficient
amounts of iron, it binds to Brutus and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's rapidly facilitating its degradation,
allowing the tight control of iron
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis responses in response to
changes in iron content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the rest of the field buys
it, but that's my current model for right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that I wanted to point out
with respect to Brutus is that these are
[SPEAKER_00]: not the only things that Brutus seems to
interact with in that used to hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also interact with another
transcription factor, which is not a BH in
[SPEAKER_00]: this transcription factor, and a gene
called important alpha, which encodes a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that may be involved in nuclear
localization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were really intrigued by this
interaction and decided to follow up on it
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in VAS2 because
VAS2 plays a role in abiotic stress
[SPEAKER_00]: response, such as route stress,
as well as response to pathogens and
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that shown that it was degraded in
an Mg132 dependent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh, it must be interacting
with Brutus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's facilitating its degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to follow up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to our biopsy analysis and
we showed that, indeed, Brutus seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: act with VAS2 in the nucleus and the
cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also interacts with the important in
the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you remove the E3 domain,
we lose the interaction with VAS2,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't lose the interaction with
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that Brutus interacts
with proteins, specifically with
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors, and maybe it
facilitates their degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it interacts with something
that's not a transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this important protein, it doesn't
facilitate its degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does interact, but maybe the important
protein is facilitating its movement into
[SPEAKER_00]: the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to verify this, we went back to our
selfie degradation assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that I'll point out is
that no matter what you do with important,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at VAS2, you see that
it's degraded in the presence in an
[SPEAKER_00]: Mg132-dependent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Brutus mutant, not degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at our Brutus mutant,
which has the full-leaf protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a Brutus mutant where you have the
protein with the hemirethrum domain
[SPEAKER_00]: removed, you don't see the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the protein is degraded, but it's not
degraded when you remove the E3 domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, showing that Brutus is facilitating
the degradation of VAS2 in a way that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just doing with the Popeye proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not facilitating the degradation
of important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see what's the biological
relevance of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Brutus is doing something outside of
iron homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back, and we attained a VAS2
antibody from colleagues in Yashou.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Japanese group, and he actually
ended up being our co-author on the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that in increasing
amounts of drought stress or cold stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: VAS2 expression, a VAS2 protein goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the Brutus with the
GFP tag Brutus, we see that the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the presence of increasing amounts
of Brutus, there's decreasing amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: VAS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further correlation that this interaction
between the two leads to VAS's
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final thing we did was check the
drought stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a VAS2 mutant, studies have
shown that compared to wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were more tolerant to drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we suspected that a VAS2 mutant would
be very similar to the overexpression of
[SPEAKER_00]: Brutus in terms of drought response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we saw that when we
overexpressed Brutus, we see an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in drought tolerance, very similar to what
happens when we look at the loss of
[SPEAKER_00]: function mutants for VAS1 and VAS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's suggesting that maybe Brutus is
doing something in terms of drought
[SPEAKER_00]: response through his interaction with VAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have another layer to this
regulatory network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between this time that we've been
working on this, a whole lot of other labs
[SPEAKER_00]: have become interested in this story and
have added new players to the story as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story is getting more and more
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just last week, a whole other set of
transcription factors came that were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really exciting time to be
working in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the last few minutes,
I'll finish up with a story that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been developing that's working with
engineers using more of a modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, a mathematical approach,
to gain insight into this whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to our time course
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I approached the Cranos Williams and
his very talented graduate student to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if we could utilize this data to
try to identify new players in iron
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the overarching question that we
were interested in asking is, if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some known iron homeostasis genes,
that are induced and repressed within 24,
[SPEAKER_00]: 48, or 72 hours, can we identify things
that are upstream of it based upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression pattern of some of these genes
that are occurring earlier on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are many different ways that
we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a picture from a review
that describes some of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithms or approaches that you can take
to try to identify relationships between
[SPEAKER_00]: genes down here with genes up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that you can do
is you input the iron deficiency response
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, you cluster them, and then you
identify relationships based upon
[SPEAKER_00]: expression pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our first aim in doing this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we developed an algorithm to try to
address this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we call this the CDAA algorithm,
the Cluster and Differentiation Alignment
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we picked a set of well-known iron
homeostasis genes, and we used this
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm and identified a number of genes
that may be regulating them that had no
[SPEAKER_00]: known iron homeostasis response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we ordered the mutants for all
of these and then checked the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: of their putative targets using
straightforward QRT-PCR analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we also had a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found is that in over 60%
of the cases, we were able to recapitulate
[SPEAKER_00]: that these genes affected the expression
of these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we were not often able to predict
the directionality of their expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we predicted that ETF9
would activate the expression of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes, and it turns out it actually
represses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to further validate this network,
because we had the promoter for Popeye,
[SPEAKER_00]: we sent the promoter for Popeye to Siobhan
Brady to do her yeast one hybrid analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she was able to indeed find that the
acyl-2 binds to the promoter of Popeye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this added some biological validation
to our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've been more recently
interested in is moving beyond the static
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to try to understand dynamics
of that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does modulating the expression of
these genes affect the expression of these
[SPEAKER_00]: genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we develop an equation that explains
these relationships?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do these, we actually had to
include the new players that were being
[SPEAKER_00]: developed between 2015 and 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these key players came up as being
regulating some of these known iron
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis genes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing this new network, we decided to
create or to try a mathematical approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a version of an ordinary
differential equation, ODE, that took into
[SPEAKER_00]: effect things like an unknown iron
deprivation signal, the degradation rate
[SPEAKER_00]: of the transcripts, the idea that some
things might be considerably transcribed,
[SPEAKER_00]: other unknown iron-related effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took us quite a bit of time and
quite a bit of back and forth to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: create an ODE that took into account a
variety of different parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of which we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we ended up with is the
ability to be able to predict what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at combinatorial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, when we look at the
expression of, say, mip-10, which is down
[SPEAKER_00]: here, what happens when we look at the
effect of multiple modulators on its
[SPEAKER_00]: activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's mip-10.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an expression in wall-tight plants
under iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our single mutants, the expression of
mip-10 looks like this in a 104 mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of its regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one of its regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can take the information about
the expression pattern of mip-10 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background of 104 or the background of
ILR3, and then we can use this
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematical model to predict what would
happen to its expression pattern in a
[SPEAKER_00]: double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the majority of the cases,
we were able to predict what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to the expression pattern taken at higher
order mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with these new approaches that
we've been taking with our engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, we're able to further enhance
this regulatory network by adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: another layer of regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only show an ASO2 here because I
know it actually directly regulates POP5,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the network extends to some of these
new players as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to thank all of
the various people that have collaborated
[SPEAKER_00]: with me, in particular, Masa Sato,
who was our collaborator for the VOS2
[SPEAKER_00]: project, Eric Davis, Danny Klevenstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a collaboration, of course,
Siobhan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have collaborations going on with
John McDowell and Uka-Hiri, Lauren Udall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and projects that I didn't have time to
talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kredos Williams, Joel DeCoste,
James Tuck, and of course, Ross Uzzani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a variety of undergraduate
graduate students and post-docs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly Dev Salote, Rosalyn
Samira, and Duri Shawar, and Anna Stalman,
[SPEAKER_00]: who've been key in doing some of the stuff
that I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to thank, of course,
the National Science Foundation and NCSU
[SPEAKER_00]: for small pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you made your network, you tested it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said a lot of times the arrows were
wrong in prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any idea why it's not
predicting arrows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so that when you look at just
based upon expression patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would predict that when something goes
up, and if the target goes up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would predict it will go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you can have something that
goes up, but it's actually having a
[SPEAKER_00]: repressive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think we didn't really take
that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, we were looking at the effect of
multiple modulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have something that goes up and
it's repressing, or nothing that goes up
[SPEAKER_00]: and activates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is where we,
and I keep using this term with our
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate students, I think this is where
we're getting into the area where we're no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer looking at low-hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to figure out what are
all of the things that control the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of X, Y, and Z, whether it's an
activator or a repressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it more difficult,
but it also gives us, it gets us deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into answering the questions of what
controls gene expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about the expression and movement of
plot-5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's a functional reason
for it to be expressed from one place to
[SPEAKER_04]: another?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it environmentally responsive?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not environmentally responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it very well, but it seems to
be localized and also types on the both
[SPEAKER_00]: plus and minus side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think iron deficiency is making
it move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that where it's localized
determines what its binding partners are,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that determines what its
downstream targets are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of iron deficiency,
it's just making it accumulate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not changing, it's not causing it to
move, which would have been cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to further investigate the
mathematical modeling, or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfied with the predictive
capabilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we'd love to further investigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, you just need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to look at kinetics,
we need to look more carefully at cell
[SPEAKER_00]: type specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're trying to create a
similar model looking at genes that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at specific cell type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that model was predicted, was based
upon data from whole-root microarray
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're trying to focus,
we're doing the same thing, we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA-seq on the epidermis, same time
course, but we're trying to use that same
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping that we'll get a cleaner
model because we don't take into effect
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are moving between cells or
things that are really not, we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to really hone in on what's happening in a
specific cell and not get diluted effects
[SPEAKER_00]: for looking at the whole root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'd love to work with,
to delve deeper into the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need hands and interested students.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cranos's lab is really, really keen on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Brutus, is the zinc finger domain
actually doing anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, that's something that I
never tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I got distracted by the E3 domain and
the hemorrhoids, I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may very well be acting as some
sort of transcriptional regulator or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: binding to zinc or maybe binding to some
other metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something that we've cloned
those individual domains, I just haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had time to really delve into what it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't check that, we just looked at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so focused on iron that I didn't
check zinc, but that's something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could very well be that it's
just as unstable in the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the amount of zinc also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be really cool is that if it
wasn't, exactly, that would be exactly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be really cool if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
