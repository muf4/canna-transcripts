[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, four, three, two, one, start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So helping our students step off the
hamster wheel, writing as an approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: foster reflection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This presentation will be talking about
reflection, why it matters, how we've lost
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and how to use some tools to
incorporate reflection into the classroom
[SPEAKER_01]: based on Center for Teaching Excellence
assistance that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is reflection?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use the definition, causing to
consider action and an effort to engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: a process of continuous learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to emphasize continuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether we're riding a bike or sitting in
a Cornell classroom, we're reflecting on
[SPEAKER_01]: our learning, sometimes without even being
conscious of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that involves asking questions like,
what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was my response?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I make sense of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it relate to other stuff I know?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I conclude?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find this to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What might I do differently next time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate the words of John
Dewey, educational visionary, who pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: out that we don't learn from experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learn from reflecting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the importance of reflection and
that it's ongoing and it's a part of our
[SPEAKER_01]: learning, it makes sense that we would
deliberately include it in our teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important to our learning
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate this student's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, I have a difficult time talking
about myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't often pause to consider my
strengths and weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: She went on to say that reflection really
impacted her because she was applying for
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this helped her think about her
strengths and weaknesses, what her best
[SPEAKER_01]: foot forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pull that word out of her quote,
or those words, don't often pause.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you, but it seems to me
that none of us are pausing these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing and doing and doing without
pausing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it almost seems as if we've grown
uncomfortable with not doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're too busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, Tim Kreider in the busy trap had
this to say, almost everyone I know is
[SPEAKER_01]: busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel anxious and guilty when they
aren't either working or doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: to promote their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're busy because of their own ambition
or drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're addicted to busyness and dread
what they might have to face in its
[SPEAKER_01]: absence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this sound familiar to any of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I don't think it's just our
university students.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cultural problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all doing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have too much on our plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about one student.
[SPEAKER_01]: It broke my heart what she had to say
about all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She went on to tell us that in her view,
I'm no longer able to express myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I once did because I'm too tense and
too critical to let myself go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost the flow somewhere between the labs
and all-nighters and term papers and
[SPEAKER_01]: prelims to the point where it's extremely
difficult to bring myself either to tears
[SPEAKER_01]: or satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what we want to see in our
student body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one way to change it up a little bit
is through writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to point out reflective writing is
deliberate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intentional.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just accidental.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just sort of writing about
whatever or keeping a diary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very deliberate part of the
classroom experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that we stage it that way
to get the most out of it for our
[SPEAKER_01]: students.
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes well-planned rubrics,
clear guidelines, sample writings of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to see, prompts that help students
know what it is you're trying to pull out
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, and then in-class experiences
that can support that out-of-class writing
[SPEAKER_01]: and reflection.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very deliberate approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about rubrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good rubric focuses on learning,
improves the clarity of the feedback,
[SPEAKER_01]: reinforces our expectations, and I really
appreciated this this semester with a team
[SPEAKER_01]: of TAs, enables multiple graders to
evaluate work really consistently across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Students can use a rubric to assess their
homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubrics engage students in the learning
process so they can describe what's
[SPEAKER_01]: expected of them, and ultimately we hope
this improves their motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have sample rubrics if they're of help
to anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have them over on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a developing scale because what I'm
after is the development of student
[SPEAKER_01]: writing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see that growth, and we use
three points for reduced subjectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a group of graders in
particular, we're going to agree on one,
[SPEAKER_01]: two, or three, whereas one to ten might be
really challenging and be more subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guidelines are important too, and they
ought to begin with why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we doing this reflective writing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for students, not for us,
and it helps them identify their
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges and areas of ambiguity and
really sort out what they're learning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it also connects back with the
rubrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two together are very robust and
very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sample writings can show students exactly
what you're looking for from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can offer a high-quality paper,
here's one not so much, and here's one
[SPEAKER_01]: that really isn't reflection at all,
so they can see exactly what's expected of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they and you are new to reflection,
this can be very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaningful prompts are important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is offer an assignment,
often one of depths that students can sink
[SPEAKER_01]: their teeth into, that help them step back
and assess the classroom experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're reading, what they're doing
in labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole classroom dynamic, so you're
giving them a really toothy prompt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just some other considerations to
support reflective writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasional in-class free writing,
pausing after 10 or 15 minutes of
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, having them write,
write, write, and then hand it in to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and have you see how they're assessing
what's happening in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can almost be a dialogue to let you
know what they're really grasping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peer review is helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from this presentation, I realized I'm
going to put my money where my mouth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last two slides, I'd like you to
just pause for a moment and in this very
[SPEAKER_01]: quick six-minute presentation,
just reflect on what did you get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What resonated with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything new or surprising?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that didn't resonate with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just pause for a few moments and think
about what did you get from your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation?
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Five, four, three, two, one, start.
[SPEAKER_12]: Couple of questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: I want you to think about who you are as a
teacher.
[SPEAKER_12]: That should be a reference.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or who do you want to be a reference to?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_12]: What is there between you and an
informational textbook?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you nothing more than a book?
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you an unput-it-downable masterpiece
when you teach?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or are you something a little more
extraordinary as a teacher?
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to talk today about literacy and
build on what Marcia was talking about.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like we had this plan.
[SPEAKER_12]: But just a little background.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we do is work with folks who want to
be public school teachers.
[SPEAKER_12]: For us, that's important because public
high school students will soon be our
[SPEAKER_12]: students.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have this thing called Common Core
State Standards adopted by 46 states
[SPEAKER_12]: across the nation.
[SPEAKER_12]: They ask students to read and write
differently than they ever have in the
[SPEAKER_12]: past.
[SPEAKER_12]: Up to 70% of that reading and writing at
the senior level will be informational
[SPEAKER_12]: text with a task like that, where students
read a couple of articles about biofuels,
[SPEAKER_12]: for example, and then have to find one
other source of their own, take a stand on
[SPEAKER_12]: the issue, and then write a policy paper
to a local policymaker.
[SPEAKER_12]: Scores will be based on things like the
position, the comprehensiveness,
[SPEAKER_12]: the support, organization, clarity,
fluency, and then editing for grammar and
[SPEAKER_12]: usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so amazing how my students
immediately jumped into it, read it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and were excited about being asked to
approach the reading from a different
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and share out with their group
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very empowering and wonderful to
see them actually reading the content for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Crystal's referencing some of the literacy
strategies we've used in her high school
[SPEAKER_12]: classes that could be adaptable to a
college course.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the strategies is this thing called
a concept of definition map.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just simply a graphic organizer.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll show several graphic organizers.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't use graphic organizers in
your teaching, I'd encourage you to think
[SPEAKER_12]: about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: In our publications, we use models.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are graphic organizers.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a different one, a Frayer model.
[SPEAKER_12]: What we know today as a teacher,
a lot of ways can be found on these kind
[SPEAKER_12]: of contraptions.
[SPEAKER_12]: How we learn is by manipulating that
information.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I took the concept of powdery
mildew and thought about what it might be
[SPEAKER_12]: confused with, some symptoms, some cures,
some prevention.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another kind of a graphic organizer is a
pen diagram.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried something, I just remember the
Hopps presentations.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went with what I knew.
[SPEAKER_12]: Ails and loggers.
[SPEAKER_12]: And just comparing and contrasting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most of our literacy strategies,
or there's a growing body of researchers
[SPEAKER_12]: who say of the thousands of literacy
strategies you can use, it might not be
[SPEAKER_12]: such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: What strategy you use, as long as you use
something where students are manipulating
[SPEAKER_12]: and transforming the information.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's another kind of a graphic organizer
and comparison contrast map.
[SPEAKER_12]: Down the middle, we have our criteria that
we want to assess two different kinds of
[SPEAKER_12]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Where should I focus my teaching
attention, content, or process,
[SPEAKER_12]: and we compare the two.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my favorites that I've used any
time I have a struggling student in class
[SPEAKER_12]: is Cornell Notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many use Cornell Notes?
[SPEAKER_12]: Shame on you to teach here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a section for the notes that
students would write in class.
[SPEAKER_12]: At home tonight, they'll write a keyword
index, and then tomorrow before class,
[SPEAKER_12]: they come in and write a two or three
sentence summary of that information.
[SPEAKER_12]: So they touch the information at least
three and probably four times because
[SPEAKER_12]: they've listened to you once.
[SPEAKER_12]: Another strategy our teachers have used,
like Crystal, are things called Admit or
[SPEAKER_12]: Exit Passes, might tie into March's
reflective writing.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's anonymous, use index cards,
either the beginning or the end of the
[SPEAKER_12]: class.
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are the Admit or Exit Passes.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if they're usually at the beginning of
class, it's an admissions ticket into the
[SPEAKER_12]: class.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the end of class, it's an Exit Pass.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might ask questions like, what did you
learn today?
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the confusing points about
today's lecture or yesterday's?
[SPEAKER_12]: And what questions still remain after
we've discussed all of this.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it gives you immediate feedback on your
teaching episodes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Changing teaching practices is not easy,
as we found working with high school
[SPEAKER_12]: teachers, I guess it's fairly similar
here.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the criteria is fostering and
sustaining community practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not every day, everything's going to go
exactly as planned.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to face reality that we're not,
we're plant scientists, not rocket
[SPEAKER_12]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we approach literacy, the writing,
the reading, not as, it is good teaching,
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's essential to what we do.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're experts in horticultural fields,
we read and write.
[SPEAKER_12]: We use information, and it helps students
feel more capitalized.
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be a mistake to go totally
wireless.
[SPEAKER_12]: You may have to use some writing,
which is an old fashioned, I had to carry
[SPEAKER_12]: a pencil to a meeting a minute ago,
and the lady said, what is that?
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, it's a pencil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_12]: And begin with authentic horticulture
learning, not with the literacy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because those common core state standards
when we're working with high school
[SPEAKER_12]: teachers, they want to force reading and
writing into everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just not natural, it needs to be
authentic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Read and write where it makes sense in
your classroom.
[SPEAKER_12]: But do so in a way that you can maximize
the academics, the reading, writing,
[SPEAKER_12]: the reflection that is actually embedded
in learning good horticultural science and
[SPEAKER_12]: practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know my computer went to sleep.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not being counted against my time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does take time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It takes time and effort.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, if Marvin wants you to teach a new
class, that takes time.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to adapt your practice of
teaching, that takes time as well,
[SPEAKER_12]: because it's uncomfortable the first
couple times you try reflection or try a
[SPEAKER_12]: graphic organizer out with your students.
[SPEAKER_12]: They feel the awkwardness and tension you
feel, but after a while, it comes back.
[SPEAKER_12]: You are better than a book, whoever you
are, better than a book, even better than
[SPEAKER_12]: a book, best seller.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we be the best teachers that we
are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think literacy has a role to play in our
teaching practice.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: And five, four, three, two, one,
start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be talking about
extension today and about the regional
[SPEAKER_10]: teams which have really been growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though we've had these for a number
of years, I think we're really sitting on
[SPEAKER_10]: a growth today.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's really good news.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's some better news about
extension and what's happening in
[SPEAKER_10]: extension than we've seen in many years.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of people here in this
audience that probably don't realize what
[SPEAKER_10]: it means to be in a land-grant
institution.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of students here,
and I just want to make sure we're all on
[SPEAKER_10]: the same page.
[SPEAKER_10]: Really focusing on the Smith-Weber Act,
which established extension throughout the
[SPEAKER_10]: United States, even though a lot of states
were doing that previous to 1914.
[SPEAKER_10]: New York is starting to celebrate our
100th anniversary this year, 1912.
[SPEAKER_10]: The difference between a regional and
county-based is that, again, county-based
[SPEAKER_10]: tended to be a generalist.
[SPEAKER_10]: They might do everything from working with
animals to working in 4-H to working in
[SPEAKER_10]: crops, as compared to a person over here
in most counties.
[SPEAKER_10]: I threw a picture of Bob Becker up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: For those of you that remember him,
Bob was my predecessor in the job and
[SPEAKER_10]: worked a lot with setting up regional
teams.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that we've got, right now in
New York, 10 regional teams, 34
[SPEAKER_10]: specialists.
[SPEAKER_10]: That number is going to go up,
but what's missing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ornamental horticulture.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have an ornamental horticulture
team, and that's something I think we
[SPEAKER_10]: really need to change in the future.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what the history of that is
that's caused that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see here, just on the upper
left-hand side, we see where the Cornell
[SPEAKER_10]: Vegetable Program, the counties that
they're working in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Over in eastern New York, we've got
counties that the vegetable team is
[SPEAKER_10]: working in.
[SPEAKER_10]: The big news is that, as of January 1st,
we're starting a new horticulture team
[SPEAKER_10]: that's going to go from the very northern
counties in Clinton all the way down to
[SPEAKER_10]: Putnam in Ulster County.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to cover not only a lot of
the counties, but include a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: specialists as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are they funded?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ideally, in a perfect world, 72% of the
funding was supposed to come from
[SPEAKER_10]: counties, 20% from Cornell, and 8% had to
be generated by the team members.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reality is that county money has been
going down significantly, and that the
[SPEAKER_10]: program-generated income, or the amount of
money that's being raised through grants,
[SPEAKER_10]: primarily through grants, has skyrocketed,
and the teams are being very successful in
[SPEAKER_10]: getting it outside funding.
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of how we set these teams up,
the vegetable team, which is the one I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: most familiar with, but most have similar
setups, is a leadership team with Mark
[SPEAKER_10]: Giles, who should get a lot of credit for
the growth of the regional teams.
[SPEAKER_10]: The technology we have allows for better
connectivity between the people out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: counties and campus groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Recession has made the counties really
rethink how they're funding their
[SPEAKER_10]: programs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's probably been the most important
thing that's happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: The success of existing teams,
the teams that are out there are doing
[SPEAKER_10]: very well.
[SPEAKER_10]: The stakeholders want to see those teams
expanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, the faculty losses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since 1994, which was the year I was
hired, so there's nothing magical about
[SPEAKER_10]: that, but these are the people that were
lost just in vegetable crops in the
[SPEAKER_10]: horticulture, Ithaca, and Geneva.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd have a similar thing if we looked at
ornamental hort or fruit.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we gained.
[SPEAKER_10]: Two good people in Anyu and Phil
Griffiths.
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, we've lost 10.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gained two.
[SPEAKER_10]: So where is that expertise going to come
from?
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard from Jan Nierhoff.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be hiring additional
people here at campus level.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, we're going to be going down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got to be looking outside the
box.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's going to be doing a lot of the
applied field work that was being done?
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1994, on the left side, are names of
people that were working in extension at
[SPEAKER_10]: that time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Over here on the right side, you see the
people that are working here now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Quite a difference between what we lost to
faculty and what has been an extension and
[SPEAKER_10]: what remains an extension that is growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the extension folks are the ones
that are really stepping up to do a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: the applied research.
[SPEAKER_10]: Research component is expected.
[SPEAKER_10]: Developing a regional national reputation
is expected.
[SPEAKER_10]: Grant writing and success in garnering
those grants and publishing.
[SPEAKER_10]: All those things are going to be expected
from these people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are doing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, we've got Chuck Bourne,
who's really taken a statewide leap in
[SPEAKER_10]: working in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Hopking, with the retirements of
faculty, has taken over a lot of the onion
[SPEAKER_10]: work that was being done in the field.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chuck Bourne, again, doing a lot of the
equipment work over in the Capital
[SPEAKER_10]: District.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Crystal Stewart has been the one that
stepped forward to lead the work in
[SPEAKER_10]: garlic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are all regional extension
specialists that are doing work that a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of the faculty was doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Invasive species becoming more and more
important.
[SPEAKER_10]: These folks are there at the front line
and working with the faculty, putting
[SPEAKER_10]: together those programs to try to be able
to be proactive when it comes to sweetmeat
[SPEAKER_10]: or a drosophila or a steak bug.
[SPEAKER_10]: All those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are challenges.
[SPEAKER_10]: The counties want to know, what are you
doing for me in my county?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so funding this.
[SPEAKER_10]: What am I getting?
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside funding, will it be enough?
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been.
[SPEAKER_10]: The vegetable team last year had 32
different grants.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a five-member team that brought in
over $500,000 total of grants for these.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the money does seem to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are doing very successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they have the expertise, the
training, the background, and the
[SPEAKER_10]: facilities to go beyond just field
research?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: Will they be able to keep up with the
technological innovations?
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, not sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to add ornamental horticulture to
these teams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Either create an ornamental horticulture
team or add these people to the existing
[SPEAKER_10]: teams, which is, I think, a good way to go
as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: And finding qualified people has been one
of the hardest things that we've had.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've just gone through two searches to
try to find a person to join our vegetable
[SPEAKER_10]: team in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_10]: We still have not found the right person
for that.
So again, the jobs are going to be out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need qualified people with at least a
master's degree that have some training in
[SPEAKER_10]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think I'm really excited about the
people that we've got out there right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully, some of you in this
audience here, some of the students,
[SPEAKER_10]: will think about a career extension,
because we need people.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need good people.
Well, we're limited to just 20-second
questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for Steve.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you foresee that these regional teams
are going to cross state boundaries?
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are the barriers to that?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see them crossing state barriers
yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: We still have a problem and an issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been hard enough to get over the
county boundaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there have been some attempts to go
over state boundaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do have that on one of the great
teams with Penn State.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is much harder.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just don't see that happening in the
foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if we get into one more really bad
recession, maybe we'll start to see some
[SPEAKER_10]: of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't see that soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious about the approach that Travis
and Marcia presented in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: reflection and writing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Steve's approach, here we talk
about these regional teams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering whether you're familiar,
Steve, with any attempts to sort of use
[SPEAKER_05]: these higher level thinking skills and
learning skills and expansion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me, most of the time,
we get to give presentations or we talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sit down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the evidence shows that these other
types of learning actually are more
[SPEAKER_05]: meaningful and more in depth.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm not aware of anyone who's been
brave enough to go beyond just the
[SPEAKER_05]: superficial presentation or information
extension.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if the regional teams think
about pedagogy and alternate ways of
[SPEAKER_05]: presenting that might move in a direction
that's a little bit more blindfolded than
[SPEAKER_10]: trying in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_10]: The short answer would be no.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of the sort of getting up there
and reading a book.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a part of the information and then
sitting down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly is going to be the next step.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't think I've really seen any
extension presentations like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind if I respond to that really
quickly, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also unfortunate that those of us,
I feel like I notice it with both your
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching and extension component to my
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have incredible resources on campus in
the Center for Teaching Excellence to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide me in preparing my courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting that we kind of don't
have that equivalent in extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe someday that will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that really does help to get us
outside the box and help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to have a similar sort of
community of learners on campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marsha, I think sometimes reflection has
been considered sort of touchy-feely or
[SPEAKER_07]: something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I was very pleased to see
you make explicit characteristics of
[SPEAKER_07]: reflection.
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you think reflection can be
applied, of course, more technically,
[SPEAKER_07]: of course, like, say, to plant physiology
or organic chemistry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have three things that are popping
into my head at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to sort them in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what that brings to mind,
you know, Ken's for those, if everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: heard him, what about the touchy-feely
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people say things like,
I'm not really a therapist, so I shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to act like one kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, 50 years of brain research
has showed us, a lot has been revealed in
[SPEAKER_01]: brain research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it showed that, you know, we don't
think in our brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think in our minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our minds are, the mind involves
processes throughout all of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: including our feelings, including the
affective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our students bring all of that to the
classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring all of their attendant
human-massive feelings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime we have more than two people in a
room, we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, our learning outcomes talk
about what we should say, do, think,
[SPEAKER_01]: and feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a part of the class.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, if we want to guide
that effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it, and it can also
reveal when we ask those kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, you know, sometimes I think
people have a personal discomfort with
[SPEAKER_01]: emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole other, that's a whole
other quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how I think we can structure reflection
is by being aware of our own limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want to talk about all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can pose questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about anything in a course that
people struggle with, any concept,
[SPEAKER_01]: principles, practices, and pose reflective
questions around that so you know how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're processing when they're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in plant physiology, it might be a
certain approach that you know students
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can pose reflective questions that
get at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also know how they're
learning, what they're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't, we can't avoid the human
being that comes into our classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense that we would organize
it in a way that they're getting the most
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the last part of your scientific
papers, your manuscripts that you
[SPEAKER_12]: submitted in the last section is called?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's reflections.
[SPEAKER_12]: Take them broadly.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's reflection about very scientific,
you know, what are the implications?
[SPEAKER_12]: How do we make sense of this?
[SPEAKER_12]: What other questions is this true?
[SPEAKER_12]: That can be reflection in very much
science work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Liz, did you ask about the question about
your admit one or the little things you
[SPEAKER_04]: would take from students on their way in
or their way out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you then typically just use those for
your own help or do you then address
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically those the next class or how
do you sort of work with those little
[SPEAKER_04]: e-value things?
[SPEAKER_12]: Both of those ways.
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of the students say similar
things.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully they get the key messages of the
learning for that day's class.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then if there are questions or someone
has a misconception in the writing,
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll use that as a reflection.
[SPEAKER_12]: A recap at the next lecture on the
previous day's talk to bridge those two
[SPEAKER_12]: content areas.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes if there are enough questions,
we can take a long discussion.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can turn some of those into a quick
quiz if you wanted to the next day.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, use that some way to bridge gap.
[SPEAKER_12]: If they got everything, there weren't any
questions, then we wouldn't use them a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But usually you'll know where you're going
to see students have additional questions
[SPEAKER_12]: or points of confusion.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you thought about using class time in
a different way?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys just did these six minute kinds
of presentations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our typical class periods are 55 or 75
minutes long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should we think in terms of repartitioning
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my first six minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're going to have a breakout group
thing and then we're going to do some
[SPEAKER_06]: other kind of thing so that each lecture,
so to speak, would be a relatively small
[SPEAKER_06]: part of that class meeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that you typically do in
your classes or that you can see us going
[SPEAKER_06]: toward?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll answer real quickly from an art or
culture perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that class, we always begin with a
reflection.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're writing as they begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have about a 10 to 20 minute
presentation depending on the topic or the
[SPEAKER_01]: comments from the students that get
involved with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have some kind of in-class
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in closing, either they're writing or
reflecting or a small group discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the actual lecture or presentation or
whatever, we know that they can't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: and none of us really pay attention after
50 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about the maximum.
[SPEAKER_12]: So what you're asking about in teaching
terms would be a flipped classroom where
[SPEAKER_12]: there's a little bit of lecture perhaps,
but a large part of the information
[SPEAKER_12]: gathering and transmission happens outside
the class.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the students are expected to actually
read their assignments before class.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we come in and maybe you have this
kind of thing, seven, eight minutes of
[SPEAKER_12]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you add in some kind of engaging
activity.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the value of all of us.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're a lot more than the Red Book Bible.
Right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Cue the head nod.
[SPEAKER_12]: But unfortunately, when we lecture,
that's a lot of what we are.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am anyway.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's information transmission.
[SPEAKER_12]: They can get that a lot more effectively.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can help students problem solve and
apply information and answer questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then dealing with extension, you're going
into a room where you might have people
[SPEAKER_10]: that are 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have somebody that's 75.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of times in vegetables and
fruit, we've got people that are close to
[SPEAKER_10]: 75.
[SPEAKER_10]: Very different ways of how they're
processing what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_10]: The folks that are younger are going to
probably respond a lot more.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can see that, that they can respond
a lot more towards getting input from them
[SPEAKER_10]: and stopping and letting them talk and
building consensus.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I were to do that with a group of
65-year-old cabbage farmers, if I stop
[SPEAKER_10]: talking and want information from them,
they're in silence.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the hit goes on for a long time
because they're not used to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a little bit harder, I think,
at extension because you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_10]: such different flying interests there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just two comments here.
[SPEAKER_11]: One for Travis.
[SPEAKER_11]: My fifth grader brought home one of those
concept mapping things.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I saw yours, I thought,
yeah, that's what my daughter got in fifth
[SPEAKER_11]: grade.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then for Steve, just another comment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we do do that same sort of
reflection thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's more like the talk's the excuse
for getting them there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all the action happens outside
the talks when they come up to you
[SPEAKER_11]: one-on-one and ask questions and things.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it'd be tough to get people to
do writing assignments during rural
[SPEAKER_11]: meetings and things like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the DEC, I mean, the other thing
you're looking at, too, is how many people
[SPEAKER_10]: are there for DEC credits.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't go in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're expecting 45 minutes of talking
about a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of a sudden, after six minutes,
they just break up into smaller groups.
[SPEAKER_11]: Discuss the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: This question is for Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly new to extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely feel like I am one of the
younger of the generation of extension
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that you guys are having
challenges recruiting for your regional
[SPEAKER_03]: teams.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the catch is for
attracting younger students for your
[SPEAKER_03]: programs or anywhere?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I kind of stumbled upon extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know that I ever knew
extension existed until I did a graduate
[SPEAKER_03]: program.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's one of the problems is that
for many students, they're not even aware
[SPEAKER_10]: of extension.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have an advisor that has an extension
appointment that they're going to be aware
[SPEAKER_10]: of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, they may not.
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not realize that there are jobs
available.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can get out there and do the
things that you really like and work with
[SPEAKER_10]: growers and do applied research.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're going into our third
potential search for this position.
[SPEAKER_10]: The pay is, I think, competitive with any
other state, if not better.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you get around it?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just an awful lot of technical
information to impart to students.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going to cut 20
[SPEAKER_07]: minutes, what are you going to cut out in
terms of content?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even afford it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe that content is essential to
understand the field.
And this is a conundrum.
But I don't know how to get around it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of a 50 minute class period,
what do students actually learn in that 50
[SPEAKER_12]: minutes?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're going to take away not
everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have 100% retention of what they
learn in that 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, it's probably less than a
dozen key points that they're going to
[SPEAKER_12]: most of them.
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember a week down the road or two days
down the road?
[SPEAKER_12]: Once a weekend happens, a lot of brain
cells get lost.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it's hard to give that up.
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you can transition, these were high
school teachers when they were using some
[SPEAKER_12]: of these strategies and they just stuck to
their guns and said, OK, you've got to
[SPEAKER_12]: bring this graphic organizer in,
build out on this subject, and we're going
[SPEAKER_12]: to start there.
[SPEAKER_12]: They really had to enforce that with the
students to make them do the work outside
[SPEAKER_12]: the class and the reading.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the students found it more meaningful
because then the lecture wasn't just a
[SPEAKER_12]: repeat of what the book said or something
outside of class.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if we stick to our guns and treat
classes in place, we're going to do some
[SPEAKER_12]: different kinds of learning.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the information download,
[SPEAKER_12]: powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm not an expert on powdery
mildew, but I can get pretty dangerous
[SPEAKER_12]: with the basics of powdery mildew on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_12]: What you can teach me about powdery mildew
is beyond, has to be beyond looking
[SPEAKER_12]: different.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a give up, but when you're honest
with us, I don't know that it's really a
[SPEAKER_12]: lot that you give up because the retention
is not enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: So going off of that point, do you think
the whole structure of three 15-minute
[SPEAKER_08]: lectures or two 75-minute lectures is
really not an efficient way of learning
[SPEAKER_08]: and should it be more of a daily thing or
a smaller of classes to get students to
[SPEAKER_08]: actually learn more information?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some colleges are going with block
scheduling so that they have longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you might take one course for
three and a half weeks so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: really sink into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that we have a lot of
creativity within the short time frames
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say, like, the classes I love are
the ones that are all accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the police class, art and culture are
the ones that are three hours long.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that it's the length of time.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what you do with the time that you're
given.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we learn things by taking hold of it,
wrestling with it, manipulating.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, learning is an effortful process.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things we often hear people say
is one of the best ways to learn something
[SPEAKER_12]: is to teach it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you heard that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, break that down.
[SPEAKER_12]: How many times do you touch the content in
order to effectively stand in front of a
[SPEAKER_12]: group without passing out and falling over
so that you can teach it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do a little reading online or in a book.
[SPEAKER_12]: You take your notes from that reading.
[SPEAKER_12]: You develop an outline.
[SPEAKER_12]: You put together a PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might check a couple of facts.
[SPEAKER_12]: You might go find pictures and video.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you actually get in front of the
students and lecture, let's say.
[SPEAKER_12]: They ask some questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, you've touched that content seven
times in teaching.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that you're teaching and things
because you have all these different kinds
[SPEAKER_12]: of interactions and different ways of,
as Marcia said, being cognitive with the
[SPEAKER_12]: thoughts, being effective, being physical
with your content, whatever.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's all of that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But together, it's how we learn.
[SPEAKER_12]: So within 50 minutes or 75 minutes,
if you're just lecturing, students are
[SPEAKER_12]: given one way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not effective.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can help them touch the content in
multiple modalities with their physical
[SPEAKER_12]: and mental being, but then also different
ways of even cognitively touching the
[SPEAKER_12]: content, that's the secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we turn a question out to you here at
the closing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about this format?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my sense is it's challenging for
the presenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It forces us to do a more succinct job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I witnessed one of these last summer
at a conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really liked it from the sitting out
there perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's such a concise delivery that
I have to listen to the speaker very
[SPEAKER_07]: carefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't pay attention to the slides.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't read the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other songs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other opinions?
[SPEAKER_13]: There were times when I wished I could
just pause the slide for like five extra
[SPEAKER_13]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if it wasn't exactly over 20
seconds, maybe the speaker could still
[SPEAKER_13]: control the remote or something to advance
the slides, but have it be close to 20
[SPEAKER_13]: seconds per slide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it felt fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just curious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we have a show of hands?
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we try it again next semester?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who wants to volunteer?
[SPEAKER_12]: Neil asked this a month ago.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_12]: Seven minutes, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I procrastinated.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had the ideas rumbling around my
heads for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had some of the slides already ready
to go, but not in a format that we could
[SPEAKER_12]: do the 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sat down at 1 o'clock yesterday
afternoon and started working on this
[SPEAKER_12]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I walked away from the computer at
like 7 o'clock last night.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the six minute, seven minute
presentation for me was probably four
[SPEAKER_12]: solid hours.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, a lot of it was me going,
OK, I got to clip that video.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have the software to do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to find that online.
[SPEAKER_12]: So now it would be faster.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd encourage you to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: It really challenged.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I, no joke, thank Neil for it.
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was fun to see the other two that did a
wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_12]: I picked one class and everybody did a
wonderful job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
