[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the chance to come up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been collaborating a bunch with the
Ryan Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been a lot of fun and a lot
of interesting research thrusts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today's talk is to give you a
little bit of a taste of some of the work
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing in Beltsville, particularly in
the development of high-residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till grain production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a taste of what's going on
down there, try to link it to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are going on up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reality is, obviously, we have some
climatic differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a little more flexibility in
Maryland with some of the work we do with
[SPEAKER_00]: corn, particularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of why I focused on corn,
was because I think that'd be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: something new for you guys in this
department, these high-residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till corn production systems,
where I take it you probably hear a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an ambitious title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like in every ambitious title,
not everything in the title might be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few little missing details,
just because I wanted to kind of cover a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide swath of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not everything in the talk is going to
cover conventional and organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most of it is going to be around
conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to make some linkages to the
implications in organic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really what's been driving
conservation for so long now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dust Bowl came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, there's been just a suite
of various different strategies in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture to conserve soil resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been an ongoing dialogue for
some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, no-till agriculture has been
one of the dominant strategies to address
[SPEAKER_00]: soil erosion and to conserve those soil
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic agriculture has its own paradigm
in which it tries to address soil
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation in the building of soil
health as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this kind of linkage
between these two systems in that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: both very soil-centric and
soil-management-centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till being this Cadillac in reducing
erosion from the standpoint of improving
[SPEAKER_00]: water infiltration, increasing soil
organic matter, again, reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, one of the reasons this has
taken off so dramatically, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a distribution of no-till ground in
the country, and this is 30% for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-south so this is 30%, and these
regions here are 25% to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this has taken off so rapidly
is because farmers can dramatically save
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of time, the amount of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cover fields really rapidly with
machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not running machinery through the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's certainly been a huge
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's challenges associated with
no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at this map here, this is a
map of herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is particularly
glyphosate-resistant species across the
[SPEAKER_00]: US, well, and actually part of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, this tracks pretty
closely to the areas that are dominated by
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this paradox in our management
between practices that really conserve our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil resources with practices that result
in some new challenges, some new
[SPEAKER_00]: management constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we're really excited,
what we can do with no-till agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide resistance, for example,
has really challenged our current world
[SPEAKER_00]: view when it comes to no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we address that and look at
you can just see the rise over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: in a matter of unique cases of herbicide
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real issue for conventional
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in organic agriculture, weeds are also
a real problem in that system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly as organic producers who
historically have not been reduced till or
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till start to try to reduce tillage in
their systems, weeds become even more
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So weeds really are at the center of this
challenge in conserving soil resources in
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these types of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the typical approach is to diversify
our chemistries, stack genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's historically how we've tried to
address resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's certainly a very important
aspect of weed control and moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: with herbicide resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of folks emphasizing
integrated weed management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is by no means a laundry list,
but it gives you a sample of the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that we target to both address
weed concerns in the system while trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to conserve some of these practices like
no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the remainder of my talk is really
going to focus on these types of practices
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we can particularly manipulate
cover crops in the system to enable us to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue towards these goals with soil
conservation and no-till agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, no talk would be complete
without mentioning cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: without going through all the lists of
services that they provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not a laundry list, but there's
a wide range of services that cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're multifunctional tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they fit well into kind of
these no-till systems or as a way of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of helping to inhibit or suppress weeds,
as well as provide another number of
[SPEAKER_00]: services in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we've been focusing on for
a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say we, really this has been a
collective effort for some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks throughout the whole Mid-Atlantic
and North-East region have had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great synergy and interactions in the
development of these high residue no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many folks at Cornell have been key
players in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly I know a big influence to
everything I've done in these systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the work that we've done over the
years have really come from Chuck's early
[SPEAKER_00]: work with John Teasdale and all of those
questions they asked related to how
[SPEAKER_00]: different mulch elements suppress weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing now is kind of
where we've been taking that work and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been trying to operationalize that
into production, grain production systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been historically using a lot
of rye and soybean systems and hairy vetch
[SPEAKER_00]: and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest in other cereals
and other legumes for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to just focus on these two
cover crops today and looking at them as
[SPEAKER_00]: in monoculture and in mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you are probably familiar with
this piece of equipment at this point by
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is simply a tool that has helped
really operationalize our ability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: high residue no-till production systems
with cover crops because it's a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: rapidly knocking down cover crops and
enabling us to plant cash crops behind
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether or not you're spraying your
cover crop and then rolling it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a mulch that suppresses weeds or
whether you're killing it effectively with
[SPEAKER_00]: the roller crimper in an organic system,
both have the same implications in the
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of creating this uniform mulch
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just gives you a taste of what
some of this looks like and the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: residues that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to first do is talk a
little bit about the equipment end of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where a lot of the learning
has been over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've implemented a host of biological
studies looking at interactions between
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds and cover crops and cover crops and
fertility management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the constraints that's really
made it difficult for us to take this from
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we're evaluating on a
research station to recommending to
[SPEAKER_00]: producers is our ability to get uniform
populations of our crops in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of the conditions of the cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just going to briefly review
some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we certainly find planters to be much
more effective than drills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have less steel that's going through
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can get better downward
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the planter certainly has better
simulation of seed and placement of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been a big step forward for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're early years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're focusing on the drills, particularly
with soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil moisture content and weight is a huge
component of the efficacy of our ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut residue and get seed into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that we're looked
at a lot over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the residue is too wet, sometimes
it's hard to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can get pushed down into the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that particularly applies to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is really wet, then it's not
firm enough to provide that resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: get good cutting action with our coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there we don't get good cutting of
the residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't cut the residue,
the planter just rides up on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you deliver a nice row of seeds all
along the surface of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't get your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a real big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Residue quality, I just mentioned a little
bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been playing a lot with timing of
rolling, with timing of planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the combinations of those practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really going to focus a lot on
that in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a number of papers over the
years that have come out that have
[SPEAKER_00]: addressed that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel like we have a better handle
now on just the interaction between when
[SPEAKER_00]: we kill and when we plant and what the
residue quality needs to be and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil conditions need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coulter types, generally, we've been
focusing mostly on using these type of
[SPEAKER_00]: ripple or bubble coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has a wavy fluted edge on it
just creates more surface area to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through that residue and more cutting
action that has to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they haven't been really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks like these different bubble or
ripple or straight coulters for various
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons due to soil texture and what
they're doing in their individual
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, you want a straight edge on
that end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Closing wheels have been another issue
that we've dealt with over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're moving towards is more of
these curved tines coupled with either
[SPEAKER_00]: cast iron or rubber disks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we get not only better closure,
but you get some crumbling more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil so that you get more seed-to-soil
contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the name of the game in
this, is both being able to cut through
[SPEAKER_00]: the residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's goal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you cut through that
residue, being able to get good firming
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some of the new planters
now that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with planters that have
trash wheels, like these shark tooth out
[SPEAKER_00]: the front, to either totally remove or
just partially remove the residues in the
[SPEAKER_00]: front of these coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have these heavy residue
slicers that come in behind that to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that residue to make sure that it's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we let the normal planter
configurations, which is back here,
[SPEAKER_00]: do their usual work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not dealing with the same
amount of residue as these front units
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we basically add another toolbar in
front of our planter just to address these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, enough with the machinery talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an ag engineer, so I don't have a
lot more to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some of the discoveries that we've
had over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a bit more about the
biology and particularly focus on managing
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops for improving the persistence
of the residues that we have out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: better weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then trying to improve our nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really been the challenge in
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: With soybeans, we're all focused on just
getting big cereals out there so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can suppress a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a nitrogen fixing cash crop,
so nitrogen isn't an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, when we're balancing both nitrogen
and weeds in these systems, regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're conventional or organic,
that's when it becomes a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why there's been a lot of
interest in combining cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get the benefits of grasses,
which are highly weed suppressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce a lot of nitrogen with
legumes that do produce a lot of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: but are not as weed suppressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the focus on combining these into
mixtures and trying to identify what are
[SPEAKER_00]: these optimal configurations, depending on
your production goals, is a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting optimal performance out of our
cover crops and having a consistency from
[SPEAKER_00]: year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the themes that I think are
important to cover from your ideal cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop mixture for no-till corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want something that is going to produce
a lot of biomass, so both it has the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for suppressing weeds,
but that it also produces a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, which translates into more
nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow residue decay, which also translates
into better synchrony of the release of
[SPEAKER_00]: that nitrogen with crop uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to cover these different
themes now in the next set of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an experiment which we
establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had about four years of this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've conducted this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just finished it last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this on two replicated sites
that have fairly similar soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this on a certified organic field
that's been certified organic since 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did it on a site that receives a
lot of the kinds of diverse amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop practicing and has similar crop
rotations but is managed conventionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a lot of similarities in
their management history, the commodities
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in those systems, like a
corn-soybean-wheat rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these two sites, we created
essentially a continuum of cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is our cover crop mixture
proportions from a 0% vetch all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% vetch and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 100% vetch, and this is 100%
rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just in a replacement series
designed based on maximum seeding rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: the monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first, let's look at some of the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are collected in half meter
squared frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're collected, actually,
in every single fertility treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I haven't described yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole host of different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole host of fertility
treatments layered on top of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took cover crop data for every one
of those points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our biomass that you're looking at
right now is a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples that are in those because the
fertility treatments haven't been imposed
[SPEAKER_00]: yet because we haven't killed the cover
crop yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're taking that biomass samples,
we have quite a bit of data that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: these figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to introduce you to is
just a simple replacement series design
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're looking at, in this case,
a hairy vetch cereal rye seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our categorical treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actual just treatments that we
imposed out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're moving from 0% to 100% vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, here's the vetch
going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the rye going up this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to look at this in a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was exactly what I shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a model that has had a lot of
use over the years to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the DeWitt Plant Interactions
and Plant Competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a DeWitt model.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more details about this model,
you can look here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into every aspect,
the nuance of this model, but just
[SPEAKER_00]: conveying that essentially you're looking
at how these species perform in
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture as compared to how they behave
in mixture and then the interactions of
[SPEAKER_00]: those across these different seeding
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the total model represents the
addition of these two independent models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, vetch is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye is going to the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our monoculture biomass of
rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our monoculture biomass of
vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this solid line represents total
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons folks use this kind of
design is because it is a useful way for
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at over yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do the combination of these two cover
crops produce more biomass than the sum of
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of interest in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's interest in over yielding for a
number of reasons, such as in
[SPEAKER_00]: polycultures, intercropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we're looking at it in
the case of cover crop performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now all I've done is just taken
that one figure and show you the extent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the data sets we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the North Farm, our organic
site, which tend to have much higher soil
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility, or at least typically does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the South Farm, which again,
similar soil types, but one is
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional, one is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking at here are three
site years of data done where both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different cover crops were
established about very similar time frame
[SPEAKER_00]: in fields that are not very far apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate is not very different between
these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want to cue you into is
just look at how strikingly different the
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior of the species are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here where hairy vetch is not
very competitive early on, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: real lag, and rye is extremely competitive
and dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to a system like this where vetch
is increasing biomass rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of factors that go into
cover crop performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of things we can
talk about in this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key points here, just where these plus
signs are, were years where we saw over
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want you to cue into is
just how much variability there is in
[SPEAKER_00]: these six site years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of factors that go into
cover crop performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're trying to get producers to
use cover crops, a big issue with using
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops is the consistency and
precision in which you can use these cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops in your production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of using mixtures is a way of
kind of reducing some of that variability
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the plasticity of the two
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even within just these two species,
you can just see on sites that tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little bit more nitrogen,
for example, such as these fields here
[SPEAKER_00]: where the rye really dominated versus
sites that were a lower nitrogen levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see big differences in just the
growth rates of the individual species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're taking this same set of samples
and we're analyzing it for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just one of those many site
years that we're just looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're looking at total end
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at end content in the vetch
and end content in the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is across this proportion
gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, whereas before we had categorical
treatments, now we're using the raw data,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the biomass that we actually
harvested out in the field, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: we put out an 80-20% mix of rye and vetch
doesn't mean we ended up with exactly an
[SPEAKER_00]: 80-20% mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the real distribution of
biomass amongst those species in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's kind of look at this point
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this is monoculture
legume biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how much nitrogen content,
not biomass, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how much nitrogen we can
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the legume in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to look at is this
region of missing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't missing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year we put out these different
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some years, vetch biomass dominated
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to span that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other years, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how much less vetch
biomass that we had in the rye tended to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see is generally,
despite that, at our 50% mixtures or when
[SPEAKER_00]: we start to get above a certain threshold,
we notice that this solid line,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the total nitrogen of the entire
cover crop, that tends to be equivalent to
[SPEAKER_00]: your legume biomass in monoculture,
in the legume nitrogen content in
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is you're trying to find that
threshold where the end content in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture is equivalent to the end content
in your monoculture of your legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we go back to this same set of
slides, now here's all six site years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this data set, as well as published
data sets all over the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did a meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was presented at the last tri-society
meeting of mixtures versus monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trends that we see both in our
data sets as well as across the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: are some key points that I think are worth
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we generally do see over-yielding
with mixtures of grass legume cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, in this case, rye,
hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do tend to get that greater biomass
production in mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that generally, when your legume is
50% of the composition of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass in mixture, that's when we get to
about that threshold in total end content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just there alone, if we're asking
if there's objectives with having more
[SPEAKER_00]: grass in the mixture, well, depending on
what you're targeting, whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen needs or weed needs, you might
want to find yourself on a different part
[SPEAKER_00]: of this trajectory based on your
management objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really will depend on a given
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're trying to do is just lay
out the spectrum of potential that's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producers would have to make those
choices based on their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the major factors we found
contributing to that, this over-yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: are really the proportion of the cover
crop and seeding rate applied and GDD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really interesting,
most experiments that have over-yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: of cover crops are not when they're doing
a replacement series like us, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually decreasing the seeding rate of
one species for the rate of another.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks who are working with
mixtures are finding this over-yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're having higher seeding rates
than what would be the equivalent of a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-species seeding rate, relitized to the
two species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summary with those set of figures that
we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can achieve equivalent or greater
biomass than monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Celerial rye tends to dominate in our
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe that's because we have a history
of manure management, a history of cover
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping and soil conservation in our
research sites that we have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher mineral end than if you're going to
some of your sandier sites or lower
[SPEAKER_00]: fertile sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, rye dominates because of
that excess nitrogen availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what I mentioned about the
plateau at 50% hairy vetch biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we follow this up with a
decomposition study looking at the release
[SPEAKER_00]: of the decay of that cover crop biomass as
well as the release of nitrogen into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we're using litter bags to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the proportions we targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we were looking at six different
cover crop mixtures, we replaced some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them and just went to 2575s and 5050s
because it's a lot of work to do these
[SPEAKER_00]: litter bag studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce you to an
exponential decay model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most common models that
we use in agricultural sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are not, Q into both
the P and the K because those are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficients that we're going to be
talking about quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is somewhat almost of a double
exponential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who are not familiar,
the main exponential decay model is right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of allows for some slower
pool decay that I'm not going to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: much discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you a little taste so
folks have an understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at here, if you hold K
constant, which is our decay rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you vary P, this is our pool size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distance, the difference between
these asymptotes represent the pool size,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's the pool of nitrogen or the
total amount of biomass that was lost from
[SPEAKER_00]: the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our pool size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what happens when you vary
P. When you vary K, that affects the shape
[SPEAKER_00]: of that decay, the rate of decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next set of models we look at
are you're going to see differences in P
[SPEAKER_00]: and K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's driving the differences
in the relationships of these cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: in their biomass decomposition and then
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you're starting to get familiar
with the various different data sets we
[SPEAKER_00]: have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cereal rye at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hairy vetch at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a decrease in cereal rye
and an increase in hairy vetch as you go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'd expect, as you increase hairy
vetch into the mixture, you have a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: decay rate, or you have a greater amount
of decay for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're generally seeing is an
increase, as you increase hairy vetch
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion, you have an increase in the
proportional loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that proportion loss is P. So
that's just the total amount of biomass in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another slide will be the total amount
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also find that as you increase hairy
vetch proportion, you have an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rate of loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, you both have a rate and
a pool size change in the decay of these
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops across these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a fair amount of variability,
as you'd expect, from year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of work, we're actually
working with the ADAPTN folks and Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Malkonian on calibrating some of the
models used in ADAPTN to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the kind of issue that we
have to address, that there's just annual
[SPEAKER_00]: variations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That this year, you had faster rates of
decay than this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might expect, there were
differences in precipitation that year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just a little bit more moist out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops decay better when they're wet
than when they're dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to build models that
incorporate this type of variability is
[SPEAKER_00]: important so that we can make models that
would be able to expect to extend across
[SPEAKER_00]: broad regions and useful for estimating
end release.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now we're going to look at synchrony
of release with crop demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing time wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've looked at how cover crop
composition affects biomass, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: content, and even its decomposition of the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to look at some of the
nitrogen dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the reasons why we're so
interested in release rates and
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition of cover crops and how we
manage cover crops may influence those
[SPEAKER_00]: rates is because we're trying to increase
our use efficiency of nutrients in our
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, any good sustainable and
conservative corn management system is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to target trying to improve nitrogen
use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of nitrogen you put out in
the landscape, you recapture as much of
[SPEAKER_00]: that as possible back into that cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the case of corn, you can see
when it starts to reach exponential uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens around at V5, V8,
and so that's why we have a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: practice in conventional agriculture to
side dress our corn and split our
[SPEAKER_00]: applications amongst nitrogen put down at
starter versus at side dress so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not dumping all our nitrogen out in the
field when there's nothing to take it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and we lose a lot of that nitrogen early
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is that we are
always so focused on good synchrony of N
[SPEAKER_00]: with our crop uptake from mineral
fertilizer standpoint, but we really
[SPEAKER_00]: understate how much available nitrogen
comes from a legume from the moment that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's terminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It releases nitrogen very rapidly,
and we have lots of nitrogen leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns and potential coming from a
legume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why these mixtures really
provide a lot of opportunity to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here again, you're looking at,
rye is not modeled here because we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't fit a model to that because there
really was no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be both a combination of no
loss of nitrogen or what's more common to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen is not only are you losing some
nitrogen from the rye, but rye is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: sink for fungal-mediated nitrogen
translocation from the soil into the mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: above the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the nitrogen is somewhat cycling
and stored in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see between 2012 and 13,
while we did have some differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big thing that stands out,
obviously, is that the rate of release of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen is really rapid in these
monocultures and that as we add grass into
[SPEAKER_00]: this mix, we delay the release of that
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're not just delaying the release
of that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're decreasing the pool size,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our decay constant,
but this is our pool size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while we're slowing down the
release of nitrogen to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: synchrony, we're reducing how much
nitrogen that's going to the cash crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: which poses a management challenge,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to hit our yield goal and
make sure we have enough nitrogen out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, though, increasing hairy
vetch proportion resulted in an increased
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of end loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we had a grass and a legume
together, there was not much of a change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pool size differed how much total
nitrogen was released, but the rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: release was similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really just a repeat of what I
just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing hairy vetch composition in
the mixture resulted in a proportion of
[SPEAKER_00]: mass loss, so the P, a proportion of end
loss, so again, that P constant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the rate of mass loss during corn
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the biomass had decay rate
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not so much in the form of nitrogen
release when legumes were with grasses in
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just a yield response from
across the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is no additional fertility
applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that we can get almost 90
bushels difference when going from a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: grass to a pure legume in our corn green
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cover crops are certainly providing
a huge impact on the performance of our
[SPEAKER_00]: cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned before, particularly as
we move towards mixtures, that have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of advantages, we're reducing the amount
of nitrogen in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can come in on a range of different
sources for conventional producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mineral fertilizer is certainly the
easiest option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UAN is some of the treatments we do
have in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to highlight that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big issue in our region, as is in your
region, is animal waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deal with more poultry litter than you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys deal with dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's a big management issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so getting a manure into the system to
supplement the nitrogen needs with our
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop was one of our objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that these are being
surface applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we surface apply, we lose a lot of
our nitrogen in the form it volatilizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus, you also have some risk of
erosion as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so surface applications has really
been a challenge to get past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been decades worth of research and
effort by both farmers and researchers to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop technology to address that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid dairy manure has certainly seen the
fastest progression in that, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easier to work with liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Maryland, this is really heightened for
us because we have more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have to now have any kind
of animal waste incorporated within 48
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of interest in trying to
incorporate animal waste as a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility, rather than applying it on the
surface or applying it on the surface and
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating through tillage,
just because of the obvious concerns we
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed about tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some of the prototypes
that folks have developed over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: to test this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small plot units.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been used in both pastures as
well as production systems, mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-plant type of applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were kind of excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like some opportunity for us
here, people are starting to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: poultry litter, these dry solids to get
them incorporated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of shopped around and looked
at some products that might work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not ag engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not interested in developing ready
technology for farmers to adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're biologists, so we're going to test
how this behaves, how we can increase use
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of nutrients, or the benefits
of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, the ag engineers will
figure this out and make this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that this has been a challenge
for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is by no means a piece of
machinery that's farm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable ready, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would work great in vegetable
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just working with pelletized
poultry litter, because pellets are really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They behave, as far as decomposition
kinetics, identical practically to bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from a behavioral standpoint,
it's a lesson to test our questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're able to put out very precise
uniform rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to ban this poultry litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the machine we built allows us to
apply it at side dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not side dressing poultry
litter is going to become a regularly
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted practice, or the focus is still
going to be pre-plant, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: logistical constraints to actually side
dressing corn with poultry litter than
[SPEAKER_00]: just coming in at planting and just a lot
of management issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to continue to test that
question of use efficiency where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: side dressing our poultry litter and take
advantage of the types of management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices we know work with mineral
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what that looks like here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a coulter cutting a trench
that's slightly skewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it creates a little trench as it
drives through the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And poultry litter is shot right down into
that trench.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these closing wheels close that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kid you not, you walk into a field a
couple of weeks later, you don't even know
[SPEAKER_00]: where this unit went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the residue is all covered up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see the disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've just dropped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can drop down up anywhere from 3
quarters to five or six tons of poultry
[SPEAKER_00]: litter in an application rate with this
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this generated several research
questions that link to these cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures that I'm going to present on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the questions that came out
of this is just, how does side dressing
[SPEAKER_00]: this unit work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it affect the decomposition of the
surface residues that we're getting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of benefits from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does it distribute it in the soil
profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does it behave over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to give you just a little
glimpse of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of work testing this question
across a suite of different management
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only going to look at a very subset
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is the additional methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're only targeting specific cover
crops, so just the monocultures and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put down poultry litter in various
different application methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we broadcast it on the surface,
which is a typical practice historically,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just put your poultry litter
right over that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or apply it over the surface, incorporate
it, and manage a tillage-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our organic site, we managed it
organically as you would tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conventional was just a chisel till
conventional tillage-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have all these subsurface
banded treatments, where we put subsurface
[SPEAKER_00]: banding at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a no manure application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to talk about a little
bit of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions about some of
the treatments that I mentioned here,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly approach me later in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand just how that nitrogen is
being released, and to be able to quantify
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of nitrogen, now we have
this whole spatial issue we've got to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken a broadcast rate, and we've
narrowed it down to these little bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the types of questions you have to ask
related to how you would take a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sample, and test the release rates of
nitrogen, and what is available,
[SPEAKER_00]: became a whole research thrust into
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we actually are doing depth
structured spatial cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the growing season of corn to see how
that nitrogen is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what a core would look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the number of soil cores
that we've taken across that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a mirror image to the left
and to the right of that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then those are compiled together
and analyzed for inorganic nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we segmented these into
these different depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a pretty good resolution of
nitrogen in that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we developed a spatial model
to assess nitrogen moving from that band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that had to both incorporate the
band effect, the cover crop effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the residual spatial dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could give a whole talk just on this
model and what we had to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just be really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a diffusion model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using Euclidean distances to
estimate nitrogen across that spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what that model looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fair number of other steps
involved in this model to get to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the pretty picture we want to
look at to get a sense of how nitrogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: behaving spatially.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one site year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't include all of the other
fertility treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the poultry litter band that
went down at side dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's our rye, our hairy vetch,
and that's our mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just our three cover crops at
five different growth stages of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the band is done at side dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you see over time,
the movement of the nitrogen away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that band, what I think is the most
startling from our results, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't move very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't move very much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were expecting all sorts of issues
related to vertical and horizontal
[SPEAKER_00]: movement that we would have to build into
these spatial models.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality of it is that a lot of this
nitrogen is becoming available when the
[SPEAKER_00]: corn is starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to grow rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see tremendous root proliferation
around the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the nitrogen is actually being
taken up almost as rapidly as it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralized from that poultry litter band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're seeing very little movement
away from the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's more, just coming back to that
other figure now, what was really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting is that we saw no difference
from subsurface banding versus no poultry
[SPEAKER_00]: litter whatsoever on the effects of cover
crop decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only are we getting very localized
nitrogen when we band that poultry litter
[SPEAKER_00]: and not a lot of movement from the band,
but we're getting no impacts on the decay
[SPEAKER_00]: of our cover crops on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because when
we're trying to manage our system and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to know what our variables
are, the more interactions we have with
[SPEAKER_00]: our management, the more challenging it is
to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to know what's going on with
the nitrogen in the soil and know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not having the same implications on
nitrogen or mulch decay allows us to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more precise recommendations or farmers to
make better decisions about their
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summary of these findings, surface
banded poultry litter applications did not
[SPEAKER_00]: affect decomposition as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, all of this is really just a
review of what I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just give you another
little taste of some of the supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: work we did around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one more piece of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on top of all this, we've created this
continuum of cover crops and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: availability and nitrogen source in the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all these different mineral
sources and manure sources and cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that that has a lot of
implications on N2O emissions coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly corn is one of our biggest
players in N2O emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's certainly an important place to
test this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't really realize what I was
getting into when we started this
[SPEAKER_00]: research, but greenhouse gas measurements
in N2O is quite labor-intensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the expertise that was
involved in guiding my graduate student
[SPEAKER_00]: and myself is coming from Michelle
Catageli, who has been doing greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gas emissions in Beltsville for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the frames that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They span the distance from cornrow to
cornrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example of a sampling
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time it rains, we're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There whether it's Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, whatever day of the week it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holidays, if it rains, we're out there the
next day sampling, because that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: driving N2O emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to give you a little taste of
what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now what you're looking at is different
rates of poultry litter applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is our tillage treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these rates, just to kind of cue you
in, this is what we consider our P-base
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of nitrogen applied at the P
removal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this 135 is really our typical
nitrogen base rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is rates that we apply that
are actually not untypical in Delmarva at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it represents kind of our saturated
nitrogen levels for either a very low
[SPEAKER_00]: fertile site or just to help us have an
asymptote in the data sets that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this nine kilograms is just
because in some of these organic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually been experimenting with
just putting down some pellets at
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually running the dry
fertilizer boxes open and dropping
[SPEAKER_00]: pelletized poultry litter at planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting about 500 pounds of
poultry litter put down at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of gives you a rough equivalent
of a plant available nitrogen that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a nitrogen gradient here of
application rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically no till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also have in there is our bare
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, across this axis is
our bare ground, our rye, our mixture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pooled for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have a year interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is two complete years of
greenhouse gas measurements measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes in the upwards of 90 to
120 measurements in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a fairly comprehensive look
at how our fertility and our cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: management drives greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, the things that stand out
obviously is that you have more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get more N2O emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be interesting to you is that
the bare ground really comes down as
[SPEAKER_00]: having the least N2O emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's not some of the
presence of carbon coming from sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon is a very important component of
N2O release and creating the conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for N2O production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also, the soil dries out quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have a cover crop on
the surface, you retain soil moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: levels much higher, which are more
conducive in conditions and environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was really interesting was that
when you look at the amount of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: applied in the form of poultry litter with
the amount of nitrogen lost as N2O,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, sure, the bare ground has its
advantages from the standpoint of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: N2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also other implications of
having ground that dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not having those carbon amendments
going back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clearly, the mixtures shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a cover crop that can both supply
the nitrogen we need for the cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a slower release rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also reduces our N2O emissions as a
function of fertilizer applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, cover crops can increase N2O
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, they respond in an exponential
way, although you were looking at log
[SPEAKER_00]: transformed data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some future plans of following
up some of this work in these systems with
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only caught a little glimmer of these
data sets and what we're kind of pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of the next phase of this is
to kind of do some multi-criteria
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments of these systems, looking at
the various different factors and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: interact, and kind of building a more
complete data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, part of the work that we're
doing here is working closely with Jeff in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the models that he's developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a really fun
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
