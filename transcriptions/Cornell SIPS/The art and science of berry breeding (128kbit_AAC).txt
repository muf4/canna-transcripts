[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such an intimate setting for all of this
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my settings I talk a lot with
growers, and so they could all fit right
[SPEAKER_00]: here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't normally fit way in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I generally bring things that
people like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in deference to all the signs in
here, these are visual aids today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later in the afternoon or during the
poster session, they'll be out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll get a chance to taste some of
these visual aids and see what I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about when it comes to breeding in berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Small fruits really is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry, black raspberry, which is
native to this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry, black berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things people eat every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are very familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, none of them are berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember your freshman biology
class, plant biology, none of these are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual berries as fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But horticulturally and commercially,
of course, they're considered berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complex group of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all in the rosaceous family,
and the ploidy levels are all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the breeding standpoint,
it provides us an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with many different systems of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So raspberries are the simplest,
being a diploid plant, which is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the crop we've also done most of our
genomic work on because the genome is
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly simple and fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry is the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome is very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inner specific autoalloctoploid,
two wild species that were accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced at some point in the 1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the genome work there has been
done on a related diploid species that is
[SPEAKER_00]: not used in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the blackberry is all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the wild, you see 2n equals 2x,
but you see odd ploidies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poisonberry is a 7x.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common berry that people have
heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, how does it produce
fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it does because there's apomixis,
pseudogamy, all sorts of strange things in
[SPEAKER_00]: blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genome work in these and some of
the other genera are a little behind
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are so complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my program is research and extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension is very applied aspect of my
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research is also very applied towards
the grower, towards the actual consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have collaborators all the way from
home gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an 85-year-old woman in Washington
who helps me test some of my varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very happy to tell her neighbors
she's the first one to ever test a new
[SPEAKER_00]: variety in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she sends me nice letters about how it
grows in her backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have multinational
corporations as well that work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll plant varieties on a large scale
for commercial markets, for shipping all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, in Europe and North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail nurseries, commercial nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, in the berry world, we work with
all of these people because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: different audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody likes berries,
at least one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like to eat them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's growing consumption in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're considered to be very good for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things drive consumption
and drive interest in berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have direct domestic collaboration here
in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New York State Berry Growers
Association has an agreement with Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They test my new material
pre-commercialization so that growers can
[SPEAKER_00]: see it ahead of time and get a look at
these varieties and give me feedback on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have international
collaborators as well in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the European Union, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan has recently signed on for one of
our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see interest in berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see berries growing all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our extension is much on the variety
trials, not only my own program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from other programs around the country
and around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also new technologies that make berry
growing much more feasible for New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been picking berries in that high
tunnel since mid-June.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tray was picked yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll still be picking for another couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a crop in New York that you
can pick for months at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides them the opportunity to get
into markets for a very long time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York growers are very close to their
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often are marketing their fruit
within a day or two of when it's picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumers are much more aware of the
quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this type of technology really
increases the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hold grower trials or field days where
growers actually come to the farms in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, lay out the fruit, they get to
taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk to me directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to see exactly how to grow it and
what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really brings a lot of excitement
to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's very satisfying to interact
with the growers and have them tell me my
[SPEAKER_00]: variety is doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they tell me they don't like my
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear too, although not as
fun to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the extension work is not as
simple as it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened three days after we got it
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the eye of a hurricane pass over
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of turned it into a mangled mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Monday morning picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding is fairly traditional in
berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recurrent selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at each generation,
picking out the best ones from each
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, recombinating and recombining
those to try and improve the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly straightforward, but easier
said than done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In genetic theory, since everything goes
back to the mid-parent, which we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get everything that's better than the
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very difficult thing to do
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are generally out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all self-pollinated crops,
but they all suffer from in-breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need genetic diversity in order to
make improvement, which then gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you don't necessarily expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black raspberry is a little bit on the
outlier because, in my theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had a genetic bottleneck during the ice
ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is localized in the northeastern United
States and southeastern Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very in-bred as a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not a whole lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do mix up the species, especially
in rubus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cross red raspberry and black
raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cross raspberry with blackberry if
the ploidy's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some other wild species that
are used for some interesting traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecular techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started, certainly, with genetic
mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no map when I started here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published maps with disease resistance
on them for phytophthora, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've moved into some RNA-seq work,
looking at disease resistance as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora work, looking at the
differences between resistant and
phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And susceptible phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in raspberry, on the plus side,
to work with, they're clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a plant, you can
reproduce that same exact genetic plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: many times as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it very nice as a model
for working in this type of field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That then branched into genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no genome for raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no genome for any small fruit at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That genome then is finished, but not
published yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on getting that paper
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have more tools as we move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential for marker-assisted
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, we are looking for ways to
speed things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting things out in the field,
watching them grow for two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very slow way to do it,
especially when you have New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you get a 20-minute hailstorm that
come across your field in July,
[SPEAKER_00]: which happened this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the fruit for about three weeks was
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot of evaluation you
can do when that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be able to reduce that
number of plants that are in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the ones that we are observing
actually have the traits that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my students came up with this
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytoptera in raspberry is a root disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard to observe the roots in a system
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came up with this hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see on the left, your left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants really like growing in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you introduce the phytoptera,
the susceptible ones die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at the difference in
expression of genes from these same plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before they are infected and after they
are infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can also look at clonoly,
individual varieties that have resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: and ones that don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resistance in the species has been
very, very durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety that's known for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was released in 1908.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very durable resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very interested in figuring out
how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetic mapping showed there were
two genes involved, two major genes
[SPEAKER_00]: covering somewhere between 50,
55% of the genetic variation between these
[SPEAKER_00]: two traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how we measured it,
we measured it just on a one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured the stem lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured how much of the petioles got
lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured just the root score,
just how dead were the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere from a little bit alive to
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: No effect whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how we measured it, those two
spots in the genome popped up again and
[SPEAKER_00]: again in the mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty confident that there's
some serious genes involved, two major
[SPEAKER_00]: genes involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when you're looking at disease
resistance and you're looking at root
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, there's certainly a lot of other
things that go along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RNA-seq work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took those two when we compared the RNA
expression before infection, after
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, in a resistant variety and a
susceptible variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've narrowed it down to a few dozen
genes involved that were very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: up-regulated during the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some others that were very
highly down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're wading through all of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the data overload is what we have
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to figure out our next target to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: In black raspberry, we have a multi-state
program right now working at black
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very minor crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one people are very interested in,
because antioxidant levels are off through
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof on black raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in fiber and vitamin B and
vitamin C and all these good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes good too, which is even
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these new berries, the new super
fruits, the Acai berry, they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aronia, you have to mix them with
something that tastes good to take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to have a super fruit that actually
tastes good would be a boon, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very interesting work done at
Ohio State as well on black raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Direct freeze-dried powders on
precancerous lesions in the mouth and oral
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity, reversing some of these lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesions in the esophagus, which esophageal
cancer is one of the worst cancers for
[SPEAKER_00]: mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking powders, direct powders of black
raspberries, reversing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are very interested in this
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very difficult crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: To produce in any volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the genetics of it in
multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at consumer preferences
and chemical analysis of the fruit to see
[SPEAKER_00]: how we can make improvements in this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really has barely been scratched as far
as breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a study a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the commercial varieties, the farthest
one away from a wild parent was two
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the varieties were actually plants
people found in ditches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they named them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's considered a commercial
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how new this crop is to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we can make some really great
progress in a crop like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where kind of the art comes
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we don't have a lot of information
on a lot of these things, we have
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have direct interaction with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use this information to try to
figure out what the consumer wants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and figure out what the grower
wants, and try to merge those two things
[SPEAKER_00]: in new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always say they want flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is kind of a tough thing in
berries and in fruit crops in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume everybody here has had an
apple at some point in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what an apple tastes like,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one's an apple?
[SPEAKER_00]: This tastes like an apple, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this tastes like an apple,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: An empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one tastes like an apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gala.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't taste like each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which one's the apple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no apple flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all different flavors that all
remind you of what everybody has in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mind what an apple should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have the luxury of naming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can say, well, this is what I
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granny Smith apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like gala.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have that advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no named varieties in the
supermarket in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European market is moving to having
all the varieties on the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And retailers here, well, producers here
are not for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies like Driscoll's, Nature Ripe,
they worked very hard to get their names
[SPEAKER_00]: on those containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I've been pushing buttons,
haven't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the producer want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the producer wants big berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big berries pick easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fill containers quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest costs in berry
production is labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all hand-picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be able to ship that sucker
from California in four days to New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks good still.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it tastes good, oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not the top priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife was talking about this last
night with my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, you know, when you need
strawberries for the fruit salad,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy any strawberries at the
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're mixing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people do buy strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see, though, in New York,
in strawberry season, the Driscoll sales
[SPEAKER_00]: go down, because people do want good
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will go out and find local
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will stop buying them from the
supermarket when they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of room, a lot of
potential for innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: New categories, new colors, flavors,
shapes, these things are all available
[SPEAKER_00]: that have not been marketed in the
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the category for raspberries is
big and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the category for strawberries is big
and red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much more in the berry
world that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry can move very, very quickly
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also stand still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look in a catalog,
this is from Norse Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of our biggest nurseries in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow a lot of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell them all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in raspberries, strawberries,
and blackberries, they have 64 varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's a lot of information for
growers to take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an astounding amount of information
for a consumer to take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from all over the world,
different states, different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven of the strawberry varieties were
more than 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the raspberry varieties is the one
I was telling you about, released in 1908.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still sold commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on one hand, we have people willing to
try new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other hand, we have people who
will never try new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been growing this variety for 42
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to argue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, this is what we'd like to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for me, I'd still like to have a nice
commercially successful variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want one with big red berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like big red berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they taste good, it's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can get a good tasting big red
berry into the New York market for local
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, that's a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Crimson Giant, one of our
raspberry releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of what can happen at
lightning speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was approached in 2007 by a company
in Spain who wanted to get into berry
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had gotten out of asparagus because
the Peruvians had driven them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were down to one product,
snow fruit peaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they needed to diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, they have about 1,300 acres of
berries, all of it under cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 1,300 acres of tunnels
stretching as far as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty impressive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in seven years, they've gone from
nothing, no sales at all, to that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This variety, we sent 25 plants to them in
2008 to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2009, they said they wanted to go to
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, they ordered 400,000 plants to
plant 100 acres, which would produce
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between a million and a million
and a half pounds of raspberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: or three to three and a half million
units, unit of raspberries, the little
[SPEAKER_00]: half pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were going to market those over a
four month period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things would go really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2014, they decided they didn't like the
variety anymore, and they're done with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move on to a new variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can plant the variety in
April, and by October, they have fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the next April, if they don't like it,
they change varieties, or on to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can happen really, really fast in
the berry world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers change the preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in Europe, too, there's variety
name on every container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get very direct feedback from the
consumer saying, I like this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can actually tell them which
variety it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the only variety you have,
you're kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the ability to change
varieties very quickly, you can maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: address those consumer concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a variety that no one else
has that they really like, your sales can
[SPEAKER_00]: go through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company sells a tremendous amount of
fruit to Norway in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have one variety that Norwegians
really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that variety hits the market,
sales double overnight, because people are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of thing that can happen
if the marketing and the production all
[SPEAKER_00]: goes the way you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new one we're coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, big red berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even New York growers like big red
berries, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of things besides big
red berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a purple raspberry or strawberry
that we put out a couple of years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: named Walker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being marketed as Purple Wonder by
Burpee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see their page.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling it for $10.95 per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have to sell very many.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an idea, a commercial nursery
sells plants by the 1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 1,000 bare root plants cost about
$110.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the same price, you can get 10 of
these, or you can get 1,000 commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't produce enough plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because home gardeners, the biggest hobby
in the United States is home gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people love new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love stuff they can't get in the
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some new raspberry varieties
becoming very popular in local markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This nice apricot color you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also catches the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: A dark berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not red in the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's overripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a farmer's market stand,
it really stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like to taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing in New York growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are directly interacting
with their consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are tasting the product before they
get to the car sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes before they actually get to the
counter to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it doesn't taste good for New
York growers, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berries is the third leading fruit crop in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't really think of it much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every place you have a concentration
of people in New York, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of berry growers around that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Rochester.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around Albany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people want fresh berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want local berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some nice bright yellow,
lemon yellow type berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste like raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly want ones that taste really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you cross a red raspberry and a
black raspberry, you get purple
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a category that doesn't exist in
the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get things that are different,
if you're working with the right
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, we can suddenly get a new
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get new shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people can look for new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my point of view, it's very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make some of these crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly what the fruit's
going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a lot of fun to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the mythical blue raspberry
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, there are no such things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry's that color.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been pictures going around the
internet every so often claiming these are
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's GMO strawberries of that same
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all urban legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic transformation in strawberries and
raspberries is simple, well characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well worked out and not of any interest to
the consumer at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the traits that have been done,
disease resistant, roundup ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers would like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers have not wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry has been terrified of it
because of negative connotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their market's often overseas,
especially the frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a bright future, I think,
in berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2002, raspberry production,
fresh raspberries, the only place they
[SPEAKER_00]: took stats was in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around $40 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years before that, it was around $25
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2009, in California alone, it hit $350
million just for raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things really happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's backed off a little bit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As labor problems in California and land
use issues, production's moved down to
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same companies, same varieties,
free trade, trucks come right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the production has moved to
Mexico where there's still over $250
[SPEAKER_00]: million in fresh raspberries produced in
California each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries from year to year are right
there with apples as far as production in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third leading fruit crop in the US behind
citrus and grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third leading fruit crop in New York
behind apples and grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: About $2.5 billion in strawberries were
produced in the US last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we import more from Mexico and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local food movement, too, really is
driving some of this demand for new
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can go to the supermarket and get
big red berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get big red berries every day
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you want something special or you
want something different, you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers market, you go to the local
market, and there's a lot of choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things available now that
weren't available even five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have the berries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll become food aids after,
no longer visual aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the poster session, you can take a
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, early-ness is a tricky thing because
there's multiple seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early-ness in the spring, we've pretty
much reached the limit of where we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: on early-ness in raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any earlier and the flowers continually
get killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until we go completely into protected
culture for breeding as well, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to get earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we're moving earlier is in the fall
crop and the varieties that produce fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: on their first year's growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've moved into late July, early August,
so we can have fruit from that time until
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can move that another couple weeks
earlier, we can expand that season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the type of plant being grown
in Mexico and California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant a plant and four months later,
it's flowering and producing fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can move that forward,
you can expand your season there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been quite a bit of work on
chemical composition, certainly of
[SPEAKER_00]: berries, and correlation to what flavor
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It often comes down to the same two
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugar and acid and the ratio between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet there are always those varieties
that everybody recognizes as being
[SPEAKER_00]: superior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't seem to have a different
sugar-acid ratio for most of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a proposal that unfortunately was not
funded had a big aspect of that in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you work with specialty crops,
sometimes the resources involved to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot of interest in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In what flavor is and the combination of
flavor and firmness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's had a strawberry probably
they've bitten into and it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crunched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no limit to how firm you can
make a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it so it will not ripen,
so that it will stay firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ship it all the way around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody wants to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's that balance of how firm is too
firm and where does the flavor come from
[SPEAKER_00]: in that combination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are varieties that are so
firm, you don't want to eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you eat it, their sugar levels are off
the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could back off on the firmness,
the flavor would probably be outstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of interest,
but not a lot of work, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Corey.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
