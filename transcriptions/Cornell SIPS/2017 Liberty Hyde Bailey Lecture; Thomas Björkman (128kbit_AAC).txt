[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice to see you all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you about a
perhaps more commonplace vegetable than
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've heard about and how it fits in
the food revolution and that is broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a revolution in the food
system when it comes to vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a revolutionary rise in
consumption that you may not even be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a graph of how much broccoli
people eat in a year in America and it may
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise you that sometime early in your
lifetime people in America did not eat
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't very well known at all and there's
been a pretty much continuous rise since
[SPEAKER_00]: about 1970 partly as a result of
introduction of some high quality hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: broccoli varieties in the 1960s and so the
production was able to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And broccoli is actually one of the most
consumed of the cooked green vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggies are tomatoes and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words pizza and french fries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about public health and
increasing vegetable consumption with that
[SPEAKER_00]: public health goal so the pizza and fries
are probably not the ones we want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: leading with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broccoli is one that's sort of a symbol of
a healthy food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a revolution going on in the
consumption and we're working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution in where that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a graph or a diagram that shows
where broccoli is currently produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So orange is summertime, blue is
wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right away there's some
big blobs in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where the broccoli comes from in
the desert in the wintertime and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold Pacific coast where the fog comes in
at night and makes the broccoli happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime it is possible to grow
in the east as long as you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northernmost coldest county in the east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is possible to grow in the winter
if you are in a particular spot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sheltered Atlantic coast of Florida not
too far north or too far south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of spots where it has
been working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're going to really increase the
production across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the availability for people who
want local and there is a considerable
[SPEAKER_00]: demand for local in the east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if we want to think about just
food security in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year in California it was very dry
as you probably heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those coastal counties where they
were irrigating the broccoli from wells,
[SPEAKER_00]: they depleted the water table so far down
that the Pacific Ocean started moving in
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath some of the best farmland in
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts us at risk to be dependent on
creating that sort of problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distributing the production across the
country is good not only to meet the local
[SPEAKER_00]: demand, the environmental benefits of
that, but really to make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a secure supply of some of these
vegetables that are critical to our
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge with moving the broccoli
over, since you see it's pretty polarized
[SPEAKER_00]: on the east coast, is that we're trying to
make it grow in a place that it really
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summertime in the east it's warm
and humid at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the broccoli depends on cool
temperatures to become broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see in the marketplace is very
specific parts of what's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: continuum in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some very closely related
genotypes at what we'd call harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably recognize the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a familiar market class.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually sold as a product in
Britain and Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's called purple cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one you pretty much can't buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, again, you recognize as the typical
supermarket broccoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of a Chinese kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening here is the flower
buds are getting bigger at maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a huge range of what's
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only like those two in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to hit exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is when we move a
California variety to the east coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it during the growing season,
it doesn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the varieties that were developed
for the summertime produce this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still not going to buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have the opportunity
to buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we think about how to
develop broccoli that meets the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what can we do to identify the
consumer demand?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start with that part that you
might say, well, you know, it's local.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay if it's local.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weird look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cooks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will just educate the consumer and
make them accept this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our experience with educating
consumers to do what we think they should
[SPEAKER_00]: do is very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even try anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second factor in this is that there's
a very specific gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supermarket produce warehouseman.
[SPEAKER_00]: They accept the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a truck comes up with vegetables
for that supermarket, they go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: they decide which of it they're actually
going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not good enough, they send it back
with the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's a perishable product,
that has essentially no value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the risk of delivering something that's
not absolutely acceptable to the
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket buyer is enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't take that risk as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: With broccoli, I think they're especially
finicky because broccoli is sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort food for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our comfort zone on comfort foods
is pretty narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like familiarity with comfort foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like novelty in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want our comfort foods to be very
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where getting the broccoli
to stop doing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one I put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It throws leaves out also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done with a rather large
team of scientists and breeders is to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of science, which I won't show you any
details of.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the developing flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the white stuff are genes turning on
that control the enlargement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, which is the process we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've taken the latest techniques
in genomics, the genetic resources that
[SPEAKER_00]: are available in the germplasm collections
worldwide, and in the commercial breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work very closely with commercial
breeders as well as the public breeders to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring all that to bear on developing a
broccoli that will look normal even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature is its experience or
anything but normal based on its
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a recently released
commercial variety that was grown here
[SPEAKER_00]: last summer when it was very, very hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took all those other pictures of
other materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten to the point where we can
have what looks like normal flower bud
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working with the wilder material
that was brought in that's part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: public programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the public programs are
absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll make crosses that wouldn't even be
considered in the private industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually license that material to
the commercial companies who then develop
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and sell those varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a good team going to try to
bring this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're quite far along on solving this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few challenges that still
remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the key things for keeping
customers is a year-round supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having broccoli coming from somewhere
on the East Coast for the entire year is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where connecting Maine and
Florida with New York being a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: producer for summer and fall is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one most challenging season is the
springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll show you this is one of the
more detailed things that's turning out to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look pretty similar, don't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out there's a critical
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that side branch is relatively short.
[SPEAKER_00]: This side branch is a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just enough longer that it's a little
bit wiggly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you pack all the broccoli
together, all those side branches push
[SPEAKER_00]: against each other and wiggle and look
ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not okay because then when you put
them out on the grocery store shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not attractive enough and the
staff will toss them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens in the springtime when
they've been growing under cold conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it starts to warm up and you
start to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that branch starts to grow a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts to grow a little bit earlier
than it would otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, is that a tiny detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes a difference between what you
can sell and not sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's another difference that shows
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the open spaces in the top
of this head, you'll see that they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit smaller than the open spaces in
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that you have to put four
or five more of these heads in a box than
[SPEAKER_00]: you do of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're less firm and so they
don't ship as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are issues that we still need to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're discovering this spring issue is
actually a fairly new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know they were going to do that
because nobody was growing it in that
[SPEAKER_00]: season before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're working with the
commercial breeders who have experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting with all of these subtle traits
that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks very normal at the end,
but behind it we're really having a
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution in the amount of consumption,
where the production is happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we're getting the broccoli to market
from new areas, and also the science
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it, learning a whole lot about how
flowers develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're hoping to see broccoli not
develop additional traits like
[SPEAKER_00]: presumptuousness, pretentiousness,
but it's continuing to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest comfort foods and we want to make
better broccoli locally available for as
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the East Coast as we can.
