[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you're here for the food
or you're here to listen to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm going to talk to you about my
favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something which when I started
working in Pakistan, I kept hearing this
[SPEAKER_03]: from the extension people, the more you
till, the higher the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ever since then, I've been trying to
find out why if you don't do no till,
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually have higher yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that's the message today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get these things to actually?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a brief outline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to remind everybody about what the
future challenges are for agriculture in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future, because a lot of you in this
room are going to be working on this in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm retired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done my bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I want to look at the history and
benefits, the problems and consequences of
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage, the importance of soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is something which is going
to be really important for future
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to look at the definition of no
till and conservation agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some new definitions which I
want to just show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the benefits of
conservation agriculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want to show you, well,
how did I get into this in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've got a website.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have I been doing since I retired?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is life like after Cornell?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do this in my classes that I used to
teach here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to increase food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do it in a sustainable way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has to meet both food and
nutritional food security, because we have
[SPEAKER_03]: a growing population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not in the U.S., maybe not in China,
but we do have in other parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, we must minimize the
effects on the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I think is really important is
improving the livelihoods of those
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not so much in the U.S.,
because you only have a small percentage
[SPEAKER_03]: of people involved in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go to India, for example,
you've got 20 million farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do we also improve their
livelihoods?
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, the way to do that is to
improve the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an economist and other social
scientists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Improve the efficiency of the natural
resource used needed for agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we improve fertilizer efficiency?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to do this at a time when
demand for food is increasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have areas of food insecurity
and even more now because of what happened
[SPEAKER_03]: with COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: The harvested area per capita is
diminishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, we have to produce more
from a smaller area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Traditional sources of productivity
already being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers are using improved varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using mechanization, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's competition for water.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Future oil prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the spike that we had not long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the future, they're gonna
become even more so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has a big impact on the cost of
inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad I don't live in California where
you have this problem there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's already resource environmental and
land degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dietary changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, in India, a lot of people in
India would be vegetarian, but now they
[SPEAKER_03]: like to eat meat and chicken, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then biofuel competing for
agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I suggest that business as usual will
not get the job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we gonna do about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to start with that statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about the
history of tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, when hunter-gatherers decided
to be more sedentary, they would
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially plant their crops with a
simple planting stick, make a hole in the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground, put some seeds in, and whatever
comes up was fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then around 4000 BC, the farmers
started using livestock manual power,
[SPEAKER_03]: manpower, with simple plows and tools to
produce their food.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the three sisters up there because
the three sisters was probably one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: first conservation agriculture practices
that you see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all know what the three sisters
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is essentially they make mounds,
and then they plant corn and intercrop
[SPEAKER_03]: with corn and legumes and squash or
pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't plow it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come back and use that as a no-till
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plows were, to inform us, the first soil,
17th century, 19th century, steam powered
[SPEAKER_03]: tractors, early 20th gasoline with steel
power, rubber wheels, and then modern
[SPEAKER_03]: tractors, which we have today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do people do tillage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these are some of the reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed control is one of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uprooting, removing, or burying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could uproot and remove by hand,
or you could do it with a hoe,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you could do it with the tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxidation of organic matter and release of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you plow the soil, you oxidize the
organic matter, and this releases
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients, which is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make the surface friable for planting or
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's an example of rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a rice agronomist and a weed
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puddling the rice for soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Puddling is where you plow the soil when
it's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You form a plow pan, impound the water,
which then helps control weeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also soften the soil for
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is some of the consequences of
tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor tillage practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see this erosion, and essentially your
topsoil and nutrients are going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Downstream or out to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some other consequences of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one down here shows this is a lot of
the topsoil and that that's going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: old mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, the big example of the
problem with tillage is dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spend a lot of time on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you imagine being the father
living in that house on the left when this
[SPEAKER_01]: happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have is essentially you
increase tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You release nutrients, but you have
organic matter into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This affects the microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you reduce soil aggregation for
drainage, you get compaction, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: till again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this spiral
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so now I can't move.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the sort of a downward spiral
of poor soil health with tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not something that happens
overnight, but over a long period of time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see the surface degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is tillage really necessary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, as this person says, are we just
burning our money and releasing carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: dioxide into the atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about soil
health and this FAO book that's listed
[SPEAKER_03]: here, Save and Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hold this closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this book at the bottom, Save and Grow
has a lot of really good information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially, agriculture must learn to
return to its roots by rediscovering the
[SPEAKER_03]: importance of healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drawing on natural sources of plant
nutrition and using mineral fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: wisely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a statement there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't spend time on it, but essentially
a healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some slides I want to show on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the importance of soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was the director of USDA in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, when we restore the soil,
we see an improvement in quantity and
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the whole goal is to take
agriculture to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will require creative solutions
and collaboration between everyone touched
[SPEAKER_03]: in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at a degraded soil,
this is some of the properties,
[SPEAKER_03]: soil physical properties, problems of
water infiltration, more pathogens,
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient deficiencies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a healthy soil would be higher in
organic matter and has some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a forest soil, for example,
where you have it's not disturbed and it
[SPEAKER_03]: has leaf mulch or it has mulches on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you find if you sample a
forest soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one on the left, intensively mined
agricultural soil, no organic amendments
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have this just says no addition of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the green revolution, it worked
really well for a while until you
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased the organic matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That affected the soil biology,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we need is a combination of
both organic matter and chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is on this side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Present farming practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm not just talking about the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about global.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience is mostly in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a healthy soil using organic
amendments, minimal soil disturbance,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of these other important things,
rotations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will be talking about conservation
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we go through soil biological
diversity, I think if any of you have
[SPEAKER_03]: taken Janice's course, you've already gone
through this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't taken it, take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's really going to be important
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially what you're trying to do
is improve the biodiversity of the soil in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a healthy soil has more microbes than
an unhealthy soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a video called Life in the
Soil, which I like to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw that video, it was done by a
Japanese group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I began to understand why this was so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something that was going on below
the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't see it, but it was really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm going to hypothesize is that
conservation agriculture, which I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to describe soon, plays a critical role in
below ground diversity and disease and
[SPEAKER_03]: pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the big question is you can talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, Cornell, our department of
soils and crop science, has a really
[SPEAKER_03]: excellent program on soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can measure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you improve it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you improve soil health?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to just go back to a little bit
on sustainable crop production
[SPEAKER_03]: intensification, the green revolution
paradigm, high soil disturbance,
[SPEAKER_03]: modern high yield varieties, high
purchased input use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got good higher yields and higher
output.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helped to essentially prevent famines
that occurred in the 30s and 40s and 50s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't hear as many of these famines as
we do today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The downside is that there was pollution,
too much fertilizer, reduced efficiency,
[SPEAKER_03]: loss of soil health, erosion, and side
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we really need to be doing in the
future is sustainable intensification
[SPEAKER_03]: paradigm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use the word responsible because I can't
always define what sustainability is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can define to you what I think is
responsible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strengthen soil health and natural
processes to boost production and
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental services, avoid waste,
use only as much as the system can take,
[SPEAKER_03]: and improve the efficiency of natural
resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of new definitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody seems to want to have a new
definition every year or every two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three years you get a new definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So climate smart agriculture came out
about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regenerative agriculture is there now,
agroecological farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to spend time on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a link on my program which will
take you to these definitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are others.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I contend is that if you're talking
about soil health and you're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: from an agronomic point of view,
conservation agriculture would be involved
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere in all three of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never mention it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about mechanized no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dust bowl, use of inversion tillage
led to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened is that the scientists and
the soil scientists came up with the term
[SPEAKER_03]: conservation tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conservation tillage was reduced tillage
with a chisel plow and stubbles were left
[SPEAKER_03]: on the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So about 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the beginning of no-till,
beginning of conservation agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: the forerunner of no-tillage farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1943, I'm not sure that our Dutch friend
is here today, but he always in his class
[SPEAKER_03]: talks about Plowman's Folly.
[SPEAKER_03]: This book is in the library if you want to
read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has ever advanced a scientific
reason for plowing, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's simply no need for plowing in the
first instance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the operations that cost
customarily follow the plowing are
[SPEAKER_03]: entirely unnecessary if the land has not
been plowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing wrong with our soil except
our interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, I'd like to use this as to
say, hey, think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't reject no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2,4-D herbicide that came out in the 1940s
helped to control weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people say, well, no-till,
you have a weed problem, so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a good opportunity for weed
scientists to find solutions on how to
[SPEAKER_03]: resolve the weed problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Research and testing of no-till in all
continents from 1960 to 2000 and limited
[SPEAKER_03]: scaling with farmers in 1980s and 1990s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it's not very far away still in
my lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by 2000, there was about 65 million
hectares of no-till crop land systems in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I want to switch over to conservation
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call this an ecosystem approach to
regenerative sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: From 1970 to 97, there was a lot of farmer
experimentation, a lot of research being
[SPEAKER_03]: done in various parts of the world to
define what are the key components of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable no-till system.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1997, meeting in Mexico, these two
people are very well known in the
[SPEAKER_03]: conservation from FAO, came up with the
definition, conservation agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about 1998.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially what the three pillars of
conservation agriculture is little or no
[SPEAKER_03]: soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no-till or just enough to get the
seed into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Permanent soil cover, that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can be residues of the previous
crop or it can be cover crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should also point out that
conservation agriculture, no-till and
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crops is becoming a big thing to get
into importance to farmers in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they provide some of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't burn the residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The easiest thing to do is to get a box of
matches and pile up some of the straw and
[SPEAKER_03]: light it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next thing you know, everybody's
having to wear masks, not for COVID,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because of air pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then crop rotation and later the
diversity of crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what you find is that some farmers
just do one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might just do no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them realize afterwards that
no-till plus cover crops or residue,
[SPEAKER_03]: leaving residues is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna show you some slides on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then rotation may come in later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so a lot of people criticize,
well, conservation, they only do one of
[SPEAKER_03]: these, so therefore conservation's no
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in a new journal called Agronomy,
not the American Society of Agronomy
[SPEAKER_03]: Journal, Experiences and Lessons from
Conservation Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have this picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the dust bowl in 1930.
[SPEAKER_03]: So around 1950, 1970, you see this big
increase in conservation agriculture or
[SPEAKER_03]: no-till agriculture to where in 2020,
well over 200 million hectares of no-till
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world at the moment, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And 2022, it's probably up around 220.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big problems with getting data
on conservation agriculture is not
[SPEAKER_03]: collected by the national programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to find other ways of getting
this information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see the main areas in South
and Central America, mostly Brazil,
[SPEAKER_03]: Argentina, are very big no-till countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the changes that have
occurred since 2008, nine in the third
[SPEAKER_03]: column, and then how much percentage of
the CA area in the region in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are still fairly small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what happened in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very small in 2008, but it became
much bigger in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six million hectares.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's probably none there at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to also raise this,
that it doesn't solve all problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no panacea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a way of helping to improve
don't forget all of the other modern or
[SPEAKER_03]: good activities that are needed for
producing food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like good genetic stock,
good potential, good these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Integrated, in other words, minimum soil
disturbance, soil cover, and crop
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity are not, you need to also do all
these other integrated approaches to pest
[SPEAKER_03]: management, nutrient management,
weed management,
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanization, permanent bed and forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, conservation agriculture can
be done on the flat, or it can be done on
[SPEAKER_03]: beds, or it can be done in basins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sustainable crop production aims to
maximize options for crop production and
[SPEAKER_03]: intensification while minimizing the
effect on biodiversity and ecosystem
[SPEAKER_03]: services.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also need to think of livestock in
here as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no tillage, it's called many things in
different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Brazil, it might be CMBRA director,
but it's a rapidly growing practice in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But notice the residue cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: The residue cover is one of the most
important aspects of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the benefits, I've listed a lot of
them there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've highlighted increased soil biological
activity, erosion, infiltration of water,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a number of things there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the last one, reduced labor
and costs are the main things that
[SPEAKER_03]: motivate farmers to experiment with this
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the important things with
any technology, the farmers have to adopt
[SPEAKER_03]: it if it's gonna have any impact on food
security.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm not gonna spend a lot of time
on that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you get farmers to practice
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to take a bag of seed and
say, hey, this is a better variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But try doing it with a technology like,
a complex technology like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you to show this picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Australia, left hand side,
no till, right hand side, conventional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice there's 35% more infiltration of
water on the left hand side.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's counterintuitive, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You do tillage so you get better
infiltration of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually textbooks are wrong on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the right hand side, see how that water
is ponding?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's happening is that water is
running off and causing the problems of
[SPEAKER_03]: topsoil loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: But notice the residue is still there on
the left hand side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at the same field at
harvest time, on the left hand side,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see the no till maze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the right hand side, you see where
the conventional tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have a maze crop and some
yield on the left hand side and zero yield
[SPEAKER_03]: maze on the right hand side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all due to essentially
infiltration of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was just drought stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got the same thing from CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at CIMIT, a wheat and maize
center.
[SPEAKER_03]: No till plus residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a long term trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is maybe after 10 years or 15
years of doing no till and residue in this
[SPEAKER_03]: plot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is without residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: No till, same no till, but this is without
residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really need that residue to help
with the surface to allow infiltration of
[SPEAKER_03]: water, to work with the soil biology,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing happens on wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without residue, this is till.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, no till without residue, what they
did is they burnt the residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So burning the residue is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes people say, well,
no till is no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, look, you get lower yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it takes time to get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no till does not equal conservation
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a picture of soybeans in Brazil
after wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another picture from Zambia where a
graduate student from our department went
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see down here is,
let's see, down the base of the maize.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maize plots, they've actually dug a basin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that basin, they put some organic
matter in and they planted maize,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they could also plant intercrop with
some legumes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we recommended is that after they
harvest this, is don't dig those again,
[SPEAKER_03]: but make them permanent, permanent basins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore all of the improvements in
the soil quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a practice from North Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Zai system in Burkina Faso.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a traditional system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So small or big farms can do this,
tractor to manual or animal power,
[SPEAKER_03]: mono or mixed cropping, trees can be
added, irrigated or rain-fed, flat or
[SPEAKER_03]: raised bed planting, basins or mounds,
depending on whether you have a problem
[SPEAKER_03]: with drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Three Sisters is an example of a mound
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a picture in East Africa of these
trees being put in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a leguminous tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the farmers will actually lop off
some of the branches and use that as
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you talk, what about resource farmers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Average farm size in India is about one
hectare, a couple of acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do these, they can't afford to have a
tractor.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they going to do this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: They have these various things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have enough money, lack of
income.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to take the risk
associated with new technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we recommend is the use of service
providers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what has happened in India and
some of these countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Service provider, you take a young person,
provide him with the equipment that he
[SPEAKER_03]: needs, and then he comes to the farmers
and essentially does the no-till and the
[SPEAKER_03]: residue into the residue for that farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He may even be able to provide some of the
inputs and some of the things for feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, a lot of the farmers in South
Asia would do their plowing that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A farmer who had a tractor in the village
would do the first plowing or the second
[SPEAKER_03]: plowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did it on the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who were the biggest opponents for
no-till when we went into South Asia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were those farmers that had tractors that
got income from the tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we soon convinced them to actually
switch over.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I say we, I meant the national
programs and the scientists and the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that we worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing which is really important
is that you need an innovation network to
[SPEAKER_03]: get the adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to local machinery makers and
developers, public sector extension and
[SPEAKER_03]: universities, non-government extension
groups, scientists, innovative farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: credits, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need a really, this has to be
developed at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see it's not a simple thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something which you can come in
with a bag of technology and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, now adopt this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to get all of these actors
involved and stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way we did it in South Asia is by
having what we call champions in their
[SPEAKER_03]: country who were able to get all of this
thing happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Policy and institutions is also really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from the same save and grow
book from FAO to encourage smallholders to
[SPEAKER_03]: adopt sustainable crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fundamental changes are needed in
development policies and institutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a list of some of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be profitable to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise they're not gonna benefit from
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the enabling factors and the need
to be in place to allow farmers to
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment with new ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go back to when I first got into
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was in the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a graph that shows the
importance of planting date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at this, there's a sort of
a optimal planting date.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is wheat following rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that about November 15th
is the best date for planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have problems with it being too hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you plant late, what happens is that
the plants, the wheat matures at a time
[SPEAKER_03]: when the heat increases and you get
shriveling of grains and lower yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: By planting on time, you can escape that
heat stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course heat stress is gonna be more
important with climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We now, we could say the national program
breeders, plant breeders have now got
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties of wheat that can be planted as
early as the end of October without yield
[SPEAKER_03]: loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore have higher yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a diagnostic survey.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this area, we were getting low yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers were planting their wheat in
December and even in early January.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so late planting reduces wheat yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the main thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons was while the previous
crop got harvested late or they grew
[SPEAKER_03]: another crop before they planted wheat,
or they had long duration varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a number of factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those you can take care of,
change the rice varieties or well,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not so easy and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then below, but one of the big things was
the long turnaround time from when rice
[SPEAKER_03]: was harvested and wheat was planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that was excessive
tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers actually plowed 20 times
because the soils were fairly,
[SPEAKER_03]: had very poor structure and they needed
to, they wanted to turn it into talcum
[SPEAKER_03]: powder for planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, and that got rid of a lot of the
moisture or there was too much moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they were threshed the rice before they
wanted to do this plowing or there were
[SPEAKER_03]: power constraints.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we came up with what,
why do they do tillage?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine plowing with a bullock and
a wood and plow and having to walk up and
[SPEAKER_03]: down the field 20 times to get tillage?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can imagine how much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a New Zealand manufacturer of
equipment come to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the key components was this
colter, this opener, inverted T opener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see what they did is the local
manufacturers were able to put this opener
[SPEAKER_03]: on their drills.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could then plant into the residue
with, and apply both seed and fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had better distribution of
fertilizer, more efficient use of
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was good for fields harvested by
hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when in 1980s, a lot of the rice fields
were harvested by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you had anchored, anchored straw
and this didn't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then as the 90s, 2000s came along,
people started to have service providers
[SPEAKER_03]: doing combine harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Combine harvesting was leaving a lot of
loose residue on the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this, this system didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the engineers in that area said,
okay, well how do we overcome that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's a simple John Blackwell from
Australia came up you can see the no till
[SPEAKER_03]: drill at the back and the back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this does, picks up the straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: You plant in, you know, where there's no
loose residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the straw is put back down on the
soil surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of farmers and a lot of
organizations in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: that are now doing no till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this no till farmer magazine is
something which you might like to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this magazine, you also see
manufacturers of some of the implements
[SPEAKER_03]: for working on cover crops or residues,
loose residues in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: In place like South Asia and India and
China, there's a lot of local
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see in California, there's a lot of
conservation agriculture now being
[SPEAKER_03]: practiced there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of cover crops being covered,
used there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's growing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we want to prevent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may have heard about in New Delhi,
you could hardly breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to stay inside your house because
it got so thick with smoke that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: dangerous for your health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also a lot of that residue would fall
on the glaciers up in the Himalayas and
[SPEAKER_03]: increase the albedo to where the snow
actually melts faster now than it did
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we overcome this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we think no till is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And leave that residue on the ground as
you residue up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what have I done since 2015?
[SPEAKER_03]: I retired in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it was seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you retire, it doesn't mean to
say you become a couch potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I've been doing is I curate and
maintain a conservation agriculture
[SPEAKER_03]: website with Lucy Fisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll see if I can get this one to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at this website, if you go to
here, you look at the full research
[SPEAKER_03]: database.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I spend most of my time on at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've all used Zotero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Zotero, if you go to the
conservation agriculture articles,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 2,870 articles now in that
database.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm adding to them every month.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible how much research has been
done in this particular field at the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also have key keywords.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the DOI number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the articles there if you need to
get them, but you can find them at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I better stop there so we can
have some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also put out a newsletter and some of
you get my newsletter, Scoop It
[SPEAKER_03]: newsletter, where I pick the best articles
every month and send them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send it out to listservs and to
various people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: The obvious question is what about the
plant diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the plant pathology?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about weed control, but isn't
that a serious problem with a resident?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the interesting things is
that that's what you would expect,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually what you find is that if you
can increase the biological diversity in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil, those organisms actually can
help control some of the parasitic
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk to the people in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to the people where this is
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do see cases of where you have more
disease, more wheat diseases, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: in some fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking of rust and smuts and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rust is not one I would worry about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rust is one that is carried from the
air and that's why you have to use good
[SPEAKER_03]: germplasm and plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have rust diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then one of the interesting things
about the Green Revolution was the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that were developed by Simit or
by Norman Borlaug and that had very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very good rust resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you use integrated disease methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use varieties that have resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not something you can ignore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to ask a follow up
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might hypothesize, and I wonder if you
had experience with this, the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, which I think comes up a lot with
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that might interact with the
moisture and how the moisture changes over
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in upstate New York, maybe in
California right now, if you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: water on that residue, you might have a
very different condition than maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia where maybe most of the time
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine that the microbes would
behave very differently in the two systems
[SPEAKER_00]: at present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of articles in the database
that I have that look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the interesting things when you
have the residue and do no till is you get
[SPEAKER_03]: much better infiltration of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually have more water sitting and
ponding on the surface with blackwood
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then you would have certain
diseases that would come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see 200 million hectares,
I don't think it's as big a problem as you
[SPEAKER_03]: think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it is a problem, then you need to
then have a plant pathologist in your
[SPEAKER_03]: program, and you must have integrated
disease management as part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't ignore that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a weed problem, you need to
look at integrated weed management rather
[SPEAKER_03]: than just use a herbicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big challenges is if you start
looking at rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem with rice is that when you
do the puddling and you do the
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanting, first of all, it uses a lot
of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It destroys the soil physical properties
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have some impact on other
properties of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very labor intensive and costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of farmers are now having
problems finding people to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: transplanting or do the puddling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the crop that follows that
puddled soil is not very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a movement to go to direct
seeded rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to direct seeded rice,
the first challenge you have is weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to overcome the weed problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're finding when I say weed,
what is happening in the national
[SPEAKER_03]: programs?
[SPEAKER_03]: I left 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are coming up with solutions using
integrated weed management to overcome
[SPEAKER_03]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even rice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have rice no-till followed by wheat
no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a much healthier soil and a much
higher yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are problems of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are problems of some of these other
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need an integrated nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any reason why you don't have
to do intensive tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can do away with minimal
tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking ahead a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's about two and a half grams of
carbon, which is increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if there are any ways
to actually be able to harvest that
[SPEAKER_01]: resource and serve it to the benefit of
the other aspects of conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see with the no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, you're not burning the
diesel for the plant preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're also finding with the mulch on the
surface that you're increasing the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of papers now that show that
you're increasing the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think that you should be
growing biofuels on agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the whole issue of carbon credits
for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see how, when you've got 20
million small holder farmers in India,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you're going to get payments for
carbon sequestration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's something that you're in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've got to keep your job and the
other students associated with you that
[SPEAKER_03]: can look at that issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm saying is that we have a big
problem with tillage system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got many places where you see burning
the residue.
It's simple.
But also, a lot of times we expect to have
cows.
And then the cow pies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in those scenarios, you're not
seeing the carbon go back to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you sometimes look at,
say, a long-term experiment, that is based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the ideal system where the residue goes
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look in practice where a lot
of farmers would move the residue and
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing goes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are very different situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till without the residue is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to be aware of the fact that
farmers have animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they need to be fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have this competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you come up with something where
you have some of the residues go to feed
[SPEAKER_03]: your animals and some of it goes to feed
the soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a very complex issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many farmers that were doing no-till
for 10 years are now going into a patient
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage because they were having soil
defection problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are saying that these
will help with carbon formation and
[SPEAKER_02]: improve the nutrient specification as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any comments about this issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've heard is not that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that farmers that said,
I've tried rotational tillage but found I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they continue with no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, I can't be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think with no-till,
with residue retention, you actually have
[SPEAKER_03]: less subsoil hard pans and compaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The compaction comes when you do tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go and talk to some of the farmers there
and ask them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers down there have been doing it
for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the farmers say there,
the biggest problem was this in adopting
[SPEAKER_03]: it, the mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your father's saying, more you till,
the higher the yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my grandfather did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now they do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the big problem is that then now
using, they have to use say, they have
[SPEAKER_03]: been using herbicide-tolerant crops like
soybeans and maize with glyphosate and
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some issues in that respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
