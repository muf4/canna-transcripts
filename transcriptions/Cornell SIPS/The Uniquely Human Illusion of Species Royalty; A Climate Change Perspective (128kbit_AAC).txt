[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Evan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the Department of Natural
Resources for giving me this opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to go beyond my usual repertoire of
climate change slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to come up with a lot of new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seminar is going to really
reflect a lot of ideas that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: bouncing around in my head for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious to see your reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing probably is a little bit
of explanation about the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of us being unique, I do think
just that so many people would show up to
[SPEAKER_00]: a seminar to hear about their own species
being dethroned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of unique about humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only humans would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not my objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really hoping that when you leave
here, you'll really begin to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a lot to be gained in
appreciating what modern science is
[SPEAKER_00]: revealing about our similarities with
other species, that the differences are
[SPEAKER_00]: really a matter of perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our existential angst about being alone,
well, we are not really so alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not exempt from natural laws,
as I'll emphasize quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not supernatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think many of us academics,
I will argue, when it comes to our
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence, actually have that tendency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recognizing our limits might actually
help us tackle our biggest environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as was alluded to, I mean, I'm coming
up soon on my 25th anniversary of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those years, there's really been
two kind of broad surprises that I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the magnitude and pace of climate
change has been much more than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, in fact, started by doing direct
effects of carbon dioxide on plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that the climate change,
while it would come, much of it would come
[SPEAKER_00]: after my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect the Arctic could be
melting when I still had several years to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second surprise has been the
persistence of denial out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not talking about some valid
debates about we have climate change and
[SPEAKER_00]: should we or shouldn't we do something
about it, but this actual persistence of
[SPEAKER_00]: denial that it even exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's actually, of course,
quite a body of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of body research on climate
change, per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's a growing body of research
on why is there this denial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to cover one little thread,
and that's really going to focus,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, fairly relevant to this
department on evolutionary biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: the evolution of the human mind and how
this constrains our ability to tackle some
[SPEAKER_00]: of our global environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the word illusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had thought about the word delusion,
but that's got kind of a psychotic twist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to be kind to our species
and call it illusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we don't really have a take on
reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two components of that illusion I'll
be emphasizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we are exempt from natural
laws, which is kind of a pre-enlightenment
[SPEAKER_00]: era problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll argue academics are as guilty as
anybody of still having a major fragment
[SPEAKER_00]: of that exemptionalism going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to do with our intelligence,
this idea that there's no bound of our
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence in terms of the context of
the evolution of our mind, that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: think our way out of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analogy that I often think about myself
when I wrestle with this issue is thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, let's look at birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a special trait,
obviously, ability to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine eagles, for example, thinking,
well, I'm at the top of the, I'm the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taking that information, instead of
sort of recognizing, but still there are
[SPEAKER_00]: limits because I have a certain wingspan,
et cetera, thinking that you could fly
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere up to the heavens to see the gods
throughout the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually, I think, what many
humans, maybe many academics do with their
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second illusion related to the
intelligence is that this leads to a level
[SPEAKER_00]: of self-awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, of course, a whole continuum
of self-awareness out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among species, and we're, just as we can
surpass most other species in an IQ test,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of levels of self-awareness,
we are quite up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be at a point where it's
actually leading to an illusion,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking us away from reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicholas Humphrey, who's a theoretical
psychologist, calls self-awareness a
[SPEAKER_00]: magical mystery tour we stage for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this adaptive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that an illusion that does not
reflect ecological reality and that
[SPEAKER_00]: constrains our capacity to adapt?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my explanation of the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm going to crank through my
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of stuff to go through,
a lot on kind of these issues that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, sort of the evolution of the
human mind, evolutionary theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of last, I'll get into its
relevance to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, this is kind of just an outline
of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about our place on the
tree of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from our great chain of being
hierarchy perspectives to modern
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through a scientific
critique of the human exemptionalist
[SPEAKER_00]: paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who aren't familiar with
that, I have some papers I could send your
[SPEAKER_00]: way after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this leads us to a couple of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are complexity and intelligence really
unique and, quote, royal traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they traits like any other?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, flight or flight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or factory ability, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about the mystical mind,
how self-awareness and our, quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: free will leads us to a notion of being
unbounded and exempt from natural laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little person between our ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of us feel this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's hard to divorce ourselves
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, our complexity,
intelligence, self-awareness, really
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive traits, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to talk about the
evolutionary and genetic constraints to
[SPEAKER_00]: human consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, some realistic,
taking this information and developing
[SPEAKER_00]: more realistic approaches to addressing
climate change and other environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Aristotle's Ladder of Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has what was really viewed at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it was a static collection of
species that range in complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, microbial life was not even
known about this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, of course, is at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notice that intelligence is up there
at the top as well, not as simply some
[SPEAKER_00]: trait that we have, but as something that
really takes us into the spiritual realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a place where,
while today with modern ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: we recognize that humans interact with all
of these species and are part of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we often get led into this
notion that our intelligence is something
[SPEAKER_00]: quite unique and takes us to the
spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Aristotelian notion got perfected
during the Middle Ages into this so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: great chain of being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the greatest thinkers for hundreds
of years worked on the great chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: being, whose fits where.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of philosophers of the
day arguing, for example, that we knew man
[SPEAKER_00]: was at the top, and there had to be a god.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, there must be angels.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of philosophical articles
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. Thomas Aquinas took part in some of
this and was in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interesting to me, having been raised
a Catholic, where what the nuns told us is
[SPEAKER_00]: only humans have a soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, St. Thomas Aquinas didn't feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He felt actually all living things had a
soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: But humans had three souls, and other
species had one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's vegetative souls, sensitive
souls, which would be what we call today
[SPEAKER_00]: sentient beings that might have some level
of intelligence, but not able with our
[SPEAKER_00]: special rational thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of related somewhat to an
area of philosophy today that's called
[SPEAKER_00]: personal and non-personal minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A personal mind is a mind that has not
only intelligence, but a strong sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a non-personal mind can be an
intelligent being, but has a very weak or
[SPEAKER_00]: no sense of self-awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hierarchy got perfected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this list.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got royalty at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work by very serious scholars in
the Middle Ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fits where?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like where actors today are like such
big shots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just below beggars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, now we can wonder, where would
the graduate students, undergraduates,
[SPEAKER_00]: professors be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This all got completely turned on its head
with Darwin, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with a group like this,
can we ever say enough about Darwin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I ever work on, he's already
done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he really did revolutionize our
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, I would argue what he came up
with has not really sunk in even among
[SPEAKER_00]: many ecologists today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the main thing, a non-creationist
view of life, not a hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all the species that we see today
have gone through the filter of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection in sort of an equal fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been carrying on their genes for
at least some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them have been carrying on
those genes for billions of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas other species have been carrying
on those genes like ourselves for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000, 200, 300,000 years, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that we've all gone through that same
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a continuity, evolutionary
continuity that the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence between creatures was not a
difference in kind, but a difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our own Whitaker, the Whitaker Room over
in Corso and Mud, many of you are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the leading ecologists who
worked on the five kingdom evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: tree of life, perfecting what we know
about evolution, primarily from the fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: record, microscopy, dividing a single cell
of evolved organisms into prokaryotes
[SPEAKER_00]: without a nucleus and eukaryotes,
protozoa here with a nucleus, and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how this is dominated by
multicellular life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humans still get up there somewhere
near the top, probably the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you a perspective of there is
microbial life is now encompassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then along in the 1980s came a
fellow named Carl Woese, who really kicked
[SPEAKER_00]: us once again on this whole evolutionary
tree of life thing and brought us into the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular age, the molecular genetics age,
and turned much of this on its head by
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating the molecular genetics of even
just the bacterial branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found if the yardstick of what is a
kingdom is the difference between a human
[SPEAKER_00]: and a mushroom, if that's the yardstick
we're going to use, then within the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial branch alone, there had to be at
least a dozen different kingdoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he in fact discovered an entire new
domain of life, the archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was battled by many evolutionary
biologists who were primarily fossil
[SPEAKER_00]: hunters, and this didn't sit too well
because his results really show that
[SPEAKER_00]: document very clearly how much of life on
our planet has been microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he made a major stamp almost as
dramatic as Darwin's, I would argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the new evolutionary tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows up in Campbell's biology book
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making it into all the textbooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really talking about perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's three kingdoms of the old five
kingdom tree, the fungi, animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plants right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gives you definitely a different
perspective of a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, this new tree is really
based on the distances between these
[SPEAKER_00]: things really reflect evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this life is microbial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the five kingdom tree and much of
our talk about evolution in the past is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the eye of the beholder view of
the world and how things work,
[SPEAKER_00]: multicellular life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when you think about this,
I'm going to be talking in a moment about
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence as an adaptable trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see based on evolutionary time how
it's been really within the flick of an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye how long we've been here and how long
intelligence as a trait has been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really has not been well tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still think, but yeah, yeah,
yeah, but we win the IQ test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more complex than everything and et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But evolutionary biologists have been
trying to bring home to people for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something out of Stephen J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gold's book some years ago talking about
that complexity does not equal progress as
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution can actually move in either
direction, but it's clearly bound by the
[SPEAKER_00]: left wall of minimal complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upper panel is looking at pre-Cambrian
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom panel is looking at today's
distribution of species in sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartoon fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the number of kinds of species have
increased over time, the right tail has
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things spill out into that tail,
but things can also go the other way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they can't go against that left wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers and frequency of the
simplest forms have increased,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've also developed a tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small number of species forming the
tail do not indicate an evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence of progress, just the inevitable
consequence of the laws of probability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we with all of our brilliance set forth
a nuclear holocaust and we wiped out that
[SPEAKER_00]: tail, it would grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not be any of the same species we
know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligence might never show up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be just a happenstance of what
the conditions were during that early
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something to kind of keep in
mind about complexity and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But aren't humans truly unique in
complexity and intelligence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we win the IQ test and we're very
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But protozoa here, much of our genetics,
much of our genetic complexity in our own
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies, in all living things, is really
wrapped up, you know, we share with the
[SPEAKER_00]: protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of Earth life's complexity was worked
out in those first two or three billion
[SPEAKER_00]: years and has to do with cellular biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know about Darwin's last
book, A 300 Page Treatise on Earthworms
[SPEAKER_00]: and Their Importance to Cycling,
Recycling and Geology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In there he devoted 50 pages of 300 pages
of his last book to earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was looking for a human that,
you know, would be complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for Mona Lisa or something
and I don't know, I came up with Penelope
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've always thought I've never met
her but I would think of her as being a
[SPEAKER_00]: very complicated woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at Giuseppe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's going on in that mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm joking around but,
you know, what I want to point out is that
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity again is a matter of degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intelligence, oh, yes, the smartest man
that ever lived, some would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly one of the most brilliant people
of the 20th century, Einstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when Einstein was about, you know,
until he was about two and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, he probably would flunk, well,
he would not do as well in an IQ test as
[SPEAKER_00]: that monkey or most primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, until he was age five or seven,
he probably did not have the same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: self-awareness as an adult chimpanzee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of age dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly we do, I'm not arguing that
we don't have, you know, some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities with abstract thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to go through and talk about
complexity and intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these topics I've got on this
list are worth a seminar on themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to run through some things
that actually have come to light really in
[SPEAKER_00]: my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first is the human genome
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I was younger, the thought was,
the estimates for the human genome were
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 to 140,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to be the most, we had,
of course, the most complicated creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to have the most genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out we had 30,000, which is,
you know, good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 30% more than a nematode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's about 30% less than a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of blows that theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I know the geneticists out
there going, what about splice genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, we've gone beyond one gene,
one protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come up with our explanations for
why, you know, this doesn't hold anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't a good, the only indicator
of complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to point out a few things that
have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our genetic makeup we have found is not
that unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew we were closely related to the
chimpanzees and other primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't know that 99% of our genes
are similar to chimpanzees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, immediately the
thought was, when we found this out,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah, so that's all, that all has to do
with brain power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 1% more genes going into our
amazing brain power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that many of those genes have
to do with larynx development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, our frontal lobes,
while the average brain size of humans is
[SPEAKER_00]: larger than most primates, the frontal
lobe, which is, and the brain scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: here, that's where rational thought comes
from, is about the same as many primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neurochemicals associated with
emotional feelings and behavior are also
[SPEAKER_00]: observed in many species we previously
assumed functioned instinctively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxytocin, which we can detect in humans
during mother-child bonding, shows up in
[SPEAKER_00]: other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serotonin, dopamine, all kinds of
emotional neurochemicals show up in other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're instinctive, then we're
instinctive too, or else they are much
[SPEAKER_00]: more like us than we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many social animals have sophisticated
language skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I imagine this group would follow some
of the news about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from prairie dogs to dolphins
to, of course, primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were learning more about body
language and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abstract thought does now require language
for some research on preverbal infants,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other species have surprising levels of
self-awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that kind of really got to me is a
fairly recent report about dolphins who,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their first year of life, named
themselves, come up with a name for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but others of their
species who might leave them for some
[SPEAKER_00]: years and come back can remember their
names, which is beyond what many humans
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is, there have been
conversations, as we're cracking the code
[SPEAKER_00]: of dolphin dialogue, there's been
conversations between dolphins where they
[SPEAKER_00]: are naming another, the name of another of
their species is being brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many other species use tools in
sophisticated ways, and this goes way
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond primates, particularly bird
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And size doesn't matter when it comes to
brains, particularly bird brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigeons is a recent study showing pigeons
have numerical capacity up to the scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: many primates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is actually the modern
genetic sort of way of, the correct sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of way phylogenetically to describe our
place within our closest relatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see we aren't really above the
rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why don't we really celebrate this
kinship?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one thing I would like to
sort of bring out in this discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: today, is talk about that, how really,
instead of thinking of ourselves about
[SPEAKER_00]: being above everybody else, recognizing
the kinship, and yet of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing our unique capacity is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin had some thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He saw this coming, and animals who have,
we have made our slaves, we do not like to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat as equals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, continuing with our notion of
superiority, science versus the mystical
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, the spiritual mind, the unbounded
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've given, while we have superior
intelligence, it's not a royal trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: except in our own minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like other traits, dogs have the ability
to pick up certain scents 10,000 times on
[SPEAKER_00]: what humans can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a continuum of ability among
species with intelligence, and excelling
[SPEAKER_00]: at one single trait does not guarantee
evolutionary success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our intelligence is also constrained by
the context of its evolution, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have some slides to follow,
which are going to bring this into gear in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the context of what the world was
like, the climate was like, as our minds
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved, affects our ability to deal with
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trait, as I mentioned when I was
showing the new tree of life, is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: recent introduction, and whether or the
adapter or the long haul has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it may be maladaptive,
as it may lead to an illusion of
[SPEAKER_00]: separateness from other species that we
know is not true based on what we know
[SPEAKER_00]: about ecology, and an illusion of
unbounded and unbiased mental capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That self-awareness issue can really
become a bit of a trap for ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lead us into a place where we really
can't get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the ultimate achievement of
intellect, our self-awareness,
[SPEAKER_00]: or source of delusion?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did the smartest man in the world
have to say about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We experience ourselves, our thoughts and
feelings, as something separate from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A kind of optical delusion of
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delusion is a kind of prison for us,
restricting us to our personal desires,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to affection for a few persons nearest
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now I'm going to turn my attention
to getting into a little more details
[SPEAKER_00]: about the context of our evolution,
and how this might affect our response to
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human mind evolved primarily to
respond to local conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from a brain, an organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come from the spirits above.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not different than the ability of
birds and their wings to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's constrained by how our brain evolved,
and that brain evolved in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: natural selection, which was not dealing
with abstract global challenges on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the planet, local
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, I think climate change among
environmental problems is uniquely
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to deal with, compared to,
for example, fracking or local water
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution problem, which can be very
local.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, many people are afraid
of the reaction to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a policy, for example,
that might affect their local economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, a gas tax, which is going
to make their life, their local
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this kind of two-pronged issue
where people, many people, are more afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of the local consequences of a policy
reaction to climate change than they are
[SPEAKER_00]: to some abstract global threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all products of evolution,
human consciousness is actually pragmatic
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: While capable of abstract thought,
our minds are more interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose at a place like Cornell,
you do tend to find more people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: quite fascinated with the abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if you look at the human
species at large, we're much more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in what works, not why it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is the consequence,
again, of evolving, the mind evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: through natural selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing our intellect has done is create
complex social structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, there's one school of thought
that, in part, our complex social
[SPEAKER_00]: structures, whether it be governments or
religions, are in response to the anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: of this sense of agency and choice that we
have, this sense of self-determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that instead of having to make all
these choices ourselves, we let the group
[SPEAKER_00]: that we belong to make some of those
choices for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be everything from going to war
to not doing anything about climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change, or it could be on the positive
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our social structures can work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can actually, in many cases,
limit our capacity for choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many recent climate change studies have
shown, some surveys have shown,
[SPEAKER_00]: that even shown solid evidence of climate
change right in their neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the social group people are
with, they may or may not believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our minds evolved over a long period when
there were very few humans on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: and abundant resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 100,000 more years, Homo sapiens have
been around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during almost all of that time into
the last couple hundred years,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pressure on our resources was not like
it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was quite, our minds evolved in a
time when we could go out and get what we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed from the resources around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's some local issues,
some local times when, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jared Diamond in his book, Collapse,
talks about things can still locally
[SPEAKER_00]: become restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, we have that sort of issue
to get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now are on a planet where we have many
more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our minds evolved in a period of
climate stability compared to current and
[SPEAKER_00]: projected climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I've got a few slides to kind of go
through, emphasize a few of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about human population,
and I know it's not very clear from the
[SPEAKER_00]: back, but you don't need to see the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this graph in the upper right,
this is showing, going back to 10,000 BC,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the number of humans on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, of course, Homo sapiens have
been around at least another 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90,000 years, depending on the data you
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost no humans, no humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: During all that evolution of our minds,
it's only been in the very recent past
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've had this skyrocketing in
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this, you can see why our brains
have not really evolved to keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of population growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another way of illustrating
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time of Jesus Christ, there were
250 million people, it's estimated,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took 1,500 years to double that to 500
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took Homo sapiens about 120,000 years
to produce one billion people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's taking us just a little around a
decade to add a billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change, this is going back 400,000
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping it somewhere within the
confines of our genus and its evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the temperature trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, as we all know, greenhouse gases
correlate with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ice ages are caused by actually
astronomical features, Earth orbital
[SPEAKER_00]: changes, Earth tilt of the axis changes,
that are pretty well understood,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least they're triggered by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homo sapiens came back let's say around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that looks like some, well,
that's pretty rapid change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this one, coming out of the
last ice age into the Holocene,
[SPEAKER_00]: the relatively stable period rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks like a very rapid change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind, this is 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about 20,000 years to rise about
eight degrees centigrade, nine degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade, which is about 0.1 degrees
centigrade per 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.1 degrees centigrade per 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that figure in your head when I talk
about what's projected for this century.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my next slide I'm just going to show a
very recent period, just going back about
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 years, the Younger Dryas period
from here to here, and the Holocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 11,000 years ago or so,
end of the last glacial, we had a rise
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Younger Dryas of about four and a
half degrees centigrade, 8.1 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of a couple thousand
years, that too is less than something
[SPEAKER_00]: like half a degree C per 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medieval warm period was a very
dramatic period in the medieval times.
[SPEAKER_00]: People began colonizing Greenland and
farming there, then came along the famous
[SPEAKER_00]: Little Ice Age, so-called Little Ice Age,
it wasn't a real ice age.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a temperature drop of about
one degree C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm showing you these numbers to
put it in context of the climate change
[SPEAKER_00]: that's projected for our century.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did that Little Ice Age drop do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the impacts of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Communities were completely abandoned in
Greenland, Iceland, and Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average male height declined across
Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pope ordered witch hunts to figure out
who was causing this Little Ice Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a one degree C drop can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that CO2 and that graph I showed
you going back 400,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top, I had the CO2 trace going back
and forth, 400,000 years, back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: between about 200 and 280.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just focusing on the CO2 trace,
and this is what's happened in very recent
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, we've risen about 0.8 degrees
C, 1.4 degrees, just since the Industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the spooky part is the
trajectory we're on now in terms of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the business as usual scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's if we really get our act together
and start slowing this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look at the magnitude of these,
even sort of a best case scenario compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of the magnitudes I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do we think our minds can really wrap
around this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some challenges there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case you're feeling sort of special,
thinking about how we can impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change, and again, we're superior
because only we could do that to the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose many of you in this room would
know who did that before us, the
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria, the first photosynthetic
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took about 2 billion years ago,
invented photosynthesis, which took up
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, gives off oxygen, wiped out mass
extinctions of anaerobic species that
[SPEAKER_00]: lived on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: When multicellular plant life came on,
it rose the oxygen level even further with
[SPEAKER_00]: more photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not alone in being able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we're on our grand climate change
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase one is complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completed in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite clear floor warning, and maybe
this is my bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were clear, but maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not have the mental capacity to
avoid a magnitude of climate change that
[SPEAKER_00]: will not negatively affect at least some
humans and other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase two is in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we have the capacity to cope with,
that is, simply adapt to some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inevitable climate change underway?
[SPEAKER_00]: How good is our intelligence, our capacity
to work together, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase three is also in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we have the capacity to prevent,
mitigate a truly catastrophic change in
[SPEAKER_00]: climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a catastrophic change in climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, some people think it's all
just going to be warmer and better,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not catastrophic at all,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say it's a matter of degree,
and there's certain things that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and nice, and some that might not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just show you something from a
recent science that kind of spooks me a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a recent article by
Diffenbaugh and Chris Field in Science,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out actually in the most recent
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This puts into perspective what happens if
we burn up all the fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this graphic is really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: On here is something that should be
familiar to you, except it's not again on
[SPEAKER_00]: an even smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that CO2 trace going back 800,000
years here, up and back between 200 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 280 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of years before the present,
800,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the various scenarios, fossil fuel
use scenarios that we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: playing out this century, possibly up to
800 parts per million or so, and I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: you some numbers about what that could
mean, 5 degrees, 6, 7 degrees C rise in
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where we go if we burn up all the
fossil fuels, which has been estimated at
[SPEAKER_00]: 20,000 gigatons.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you at the beginning I've done a
lot of CO2 research on plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one thing, one sort of little silver
lining to some of the climate change work
[SPEAKER_00]: has been that when plants are exposed to
higher CO2 levels because they take CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthesis to grow, it can benefit
some plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we never went up to 2,000,
not very often, and in fact when you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves curl, they get starch grains,
and the plants don't do very well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that CO2 level, even if there weren't a
concomitant climate change, would wreak
[SPEAKER_00]: havoc on a lot of plant life on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine that this would, this would
diminish over time due to photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake and some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that level, you've all probably read
the information about what even this level
[SPEAKER_00]: might mean for sea level rise,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be close to catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that there won't be any humans left on
the planet, but they're all gonna be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the highlands of Ithaca, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got this cartoon there for a little
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing back, I'd like to bring in these
powerful big time thinkers here to support
[SPEAKER_00]: my arguments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwin, it's not the strongest of the
species that survive, nor the most
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent that survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the one that is most adaptable to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't put a lot of faith in
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we successfully think our way through
our self-imposed environmental challenges?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question I pose to you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come up with a couple pieces of
evidence looking for a way to leave you
[SPEAKER_00]: with some optimism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been heavy on the negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have turned a corner on human
population growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not think this would happen when I
was young and read Ehrlich's Population
[SPEAKER_00]: Bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually made some significant
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a recent science article
showing dramatic reductions in the global
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continental Africa, many nations there
still have fairly high fertility rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't really intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really, in all cases,
something where we're reaching the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: of our resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it was simply a focus on poverty
or social justice, gender issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: education of women as well as men,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a real example of something to
be optimistic about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's an intentional example,
which might have issues about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecological models now more clearly
recognize human societies as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecologists are doing this routinely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something from Terry Chapin,
mathematician, a climate change model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very strong emphasis on social systems
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very positive sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have begun to acknowledge and even
celebrate our kinship with other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few months ago, India declared
dolphins non-human persons with special
[SPEAKER_00]: rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several other countries have done the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you can't have them in captivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have them doing tricks for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety of things going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're learning a lot about framing
the discourse on climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk particularly to people who
we're trying to bring into the issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: not people who are very familiar and ready
to go at it and start fixing things,
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion is that the best we can do,
especially as we're a lot of nature lovers
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the natural resources department,
most of us are in a department like this
[SPEAKER_00]: or affiliated with a department like this
because of our passion for the natural
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually being, I would say, almost in
love with the natural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sharing that is probably the most
productive thing we can do in terms of at
[SPEAKER_00]: least getting people on the right course
rather than talking to them about how
[SPEAKER_00]: polluted the world is and how they've got
something they've got to do to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can come later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people don't want to destroy that
which they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of what is so wonderful about
the world is actually our connection with
[SPEAKER_00]: other species, our similarities and not
our differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a more concrete level, communications
researchers have done a lot on framing the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and they've come up with some
approaches that I think were discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: because they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually from what I've talked about
in this seminar, I think you can see it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to some of these evolutionary
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication now by emphasizing the human
and the local impacts, not the global
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts, and emphasizing practical
solutions and economically viable
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives to the path we're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the extent we respond to local,
well, the local impacts are changing
[SPEAKER_00]: mindsets here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people have to pay the cost of
adapting, dealing with climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: even among the farmers that I work closely
with, the most recent and intensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive survey in the Midwest of
something like 6,000 farmers, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4,800 farmers found that over 65% said
they quote, believed in climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them were convinced human were
causing it, but majority felt there was
[SPEAKER_00]: human cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot we can see around us as
individuals, local communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: governments, corporations attempting to
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of my friends in the room,
I've got Solarize Caroline there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart gets a lot of bad press and it's
got some issues now with pay rates for
[SPEAKER_00]: employees, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether this is just greenwashing or
how deep it goes, but just the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel like they need to do this is I
think a sign in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the UNIPCC, again,
I might be biased because I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliated in various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's an example of our
social structures actually doing a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is an intelligence and adaptive trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be up to us to demonstrate that as
so, particularly the younger people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until then, it's really not a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a belief, it's a faith, and it's a
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave you with this quote that I
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the science about what is
happening on Earth and aren't pessimistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't understand data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you meet the people who are working
to restore this Earth and the lives of the
[SPEAKER_00]: poor and you aren't optimistic,
you haven't got a pulse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some references here for those who
are interested, but I think I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it with that slide and take
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
