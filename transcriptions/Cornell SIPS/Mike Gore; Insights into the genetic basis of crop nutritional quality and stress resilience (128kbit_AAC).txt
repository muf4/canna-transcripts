[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large part of my research is focused on
maize, which we all love, but it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: global starchy staple crop, and that would
greatly benefit from biofortification for
[SPEAKER_00]: development of nutrient-dense grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I say this is when you focus on this
map here, and this is a map of maize
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption by mean percentage of daily
calories per capita, you can see countries
[SPEAKER_00]: in Sub-Saharan Africa that are having to
subsist very highly in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: caloric intake from maize, and this orange
country right here is Zambia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the nutritional
profile of maize, it often does not
[SPEAKER_00]: provide adequate daily levels of essential
nutrients that we need to survive as human
beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also feeding to animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that we work on in my
research group is iron and zinc,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pro-vitamin A, vitamin E,
and the B vitamin complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see here, maize is great in
terms of a vehicle for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates out to animals and human
beings, but it is very popular in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as an approach, you can have a
plant biofortifying itself, so harnessing
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes and alleles that naturally occur
in the population or through transgenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you could also complement through plant
breeding with chemical fortification,
[SPEAKER_00]: dietary diversification, or in a sense,
giving vitamins to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the arguments that I would like to
make is biofortification is targeted to
[SPEAKER_00]: rural smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sustainable, and it's renewable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these three other approaches should be
complementary to biofortification because
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no single panacea that can be
used to overcome nutritional deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: in our growing world population.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major traits or phenotypes that
we focus on in my lab is pro-vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the global prevalence
of vitamin A deficiency in the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: see the map here of sub-Saharan Africa,
and that overlays quite well with in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of caloric intake of maize daily calories,
and also in these sub-Saharan Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, people are subsisting on a lot
of other crops, such as cassava,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are, in a sense, low in vitamin
content as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impact of this, there are 7
million pregnant women, 127 million
[SPEAKER_00]: preschool age children that are vitamin A
deficient in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consequence also, vitamin A
deficiency causes 600,000 early childhood
[SPEAKER_00]: deaths, blindness in 500,000 children each
year, and all of this is preventable
[SPEAKER_00]: through improved nutritional food
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when breeding any crop,
the first question you must ask yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there a natural variation for this
particular phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in maize, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're just looking at the gradient
of light yellow to dark orange kernel
[SPEAKER_00]: color phenotypes, in a world's collection
of temperate and tropical maize throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, if you look at the total
carotenoid profile in the maize grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-carotene, which has the highest
pro-vitamin A activity, only accounts for
[SPEAKER_00]: 6% of all those carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to highlight that when we're
talking about carotenoids in maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're mostly found in the endosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you break out that 6% slice here,
on average, 1.7 microgram per gram are
[SPEAKER_00]: found in these maize grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harvest Plus, which is very much
focused on biofortification of our
[SPEAKER_00]: important food crops, has worked with
human nutritionists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're highly recommend a 10-fold
increase as compared to the average there,
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of this as a set breeding target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a breeding target that people
have been trying to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some breeding programs have actually
surpassed at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also work on vitamin E in my lab as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, I would kind of define
vitamin E more as an insufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at reports of
insufficiency in the world, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: in countries such as Brazil, the US,
Tunisia, South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the US, about 26% or 41% of
individuals have plasma alpha-tocopherol
[SPEAKER_00]: content in their plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is at a level that increases their
risk for cardiovascular disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so although few reports exist for
other developing nations, it is thought of
[SPEAKER_00]: that these concentrations are probably
even lower and more widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about vitamin E and more so
alpha-tocopherol, which has the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin E activity in the human body and
also animals, we see here of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: toco-chromatols found in maize,
maize grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have alpha-tocopherol in this
shaded blue color right here, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts for about 11%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost all of that alpha-tocopherol is
found in the embryo of the maize grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have a higher average as
compared to beta-carotene 8.19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do the calculations and working
with human nutritionists, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately close to a five-fold
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we would have to have as a breeding
target on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at where we were when
we began this one project about in 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first take-home here is a lot of these
compounds are all derived from a shared
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway, such as like the
aromatic amino acid pathway and the TGDP
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have an HGDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: HGA, which is coming off and being used as
the head group, and a phyto-DP,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is important for the tail group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, through the chemical action of
the enzymes themselves, give rise to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical variation for toco-chromatols
in maize grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two genes right here,
BTE1 and BTE4, had been, we, in our lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: had been found to be underlying large
effect QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the carotenoid traits here,
we see the two genes, Leike and CRIT-RB1,
[SPEAKER_00]: which have been published on previously in
2008 and 2010 out of the work here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell and Ed's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two genes themselves have been
used in the cement harvest plus breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program to develop orange high-pro-vitamin
A maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that seems to have worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these particular genes themself are
only capturing just a snapshot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in the maize germplasm pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're trying to now do here is use
large populations to try to map the
[SPEAKER_00]: locations of other QTLs, genes,
in the maize genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have HapMap version one and
version two that have been genotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: imputed and projected in the maize NAM
population here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with our colleagues at MSU and
Dr. Dean de la Penna's lab, we've run HVLC
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost 20,000 HVLC runs to quantify
the carotenoid content and composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same for token-chromatol-vitamin
E, token-chromatol-content and
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And expression profiling has also been
performed as well on all of the 26 NAM
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also at sixth of development stages
post-pollination times 40,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we want to really
understand which genes are turned off over
[SPEAKER_00]: the developmental program of the kernel
itself and to also put the QTL on a time
[SPEAKER_00]: axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to carry out this research in the
maize NAM population, what we first do is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is referred to as a joint linkage
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're identifying the QTLs in the
maize genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of the maize NAM
population as a map within a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're just using the recent
recombination that has happened in the
[SPEAKER_00]: construction of the maize NAM population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we're just identifying the
chromosomal segments in the genome that
[SPEAKER_00]: have that QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the GWAS, which now we're using a
higher quantity of SNPs, here what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: now using is the ancient recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is through the evolutionary
history of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the LD blocks compared to
the recent recombination map are much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we're going to receive
the higher resolution for trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: finally map and hopefully identify the
causal genes that are controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: variation for these important nutritional
grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our work, what we've found here,
if we just focus on the carotenoid traits
[SPEAKER_00]: first, we found that essentially 10A
priority pathway and two novel genes
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly underlie the natural variation for
these carotenoid traits in maize grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to walk you through this,
D, XS2, and 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two genes were involved in the
parental tail synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three genes upstream of the pathway branch
point right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: PSY1, PDS1 in mutans right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these four genes within the core
pathway right here, Leike, LUT1,
[SPEAKER_00]: CRIT-RB1, and Zep1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we reconfirmed Leike and CRIT-RB1,
which had been previously used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: CEMET harvest plus breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also identified a carotenoid
cleavage enzyme, which essentially is
[SPEAKER_00]: turning over the carotenoid compounds and
chewing them up, which is definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we dissect this even further,
essentially about six A priority pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are what we refer to as
expression QTL are explaining the majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of the phenotypic variation for these
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Leike, PSY1, Zep1,
CCD1, DXS2, and CRIT-RB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a sense, these variants that are
associating with the phenotype are cis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's explaining the fact that they're
expression QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other genes that were hit do
not appear to be expression QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps that the actual SNPs or the
causative variants are changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of the enzyme itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be like LUT1, DXS3,
and mutans, and PDS1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the two novel genes that we hit
here, one is an uncharacterized protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can obviously just hypothesize what
you think it may be, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: uncharacterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing about candidate genes
in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one was the MIB
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to point out that these two
novel genes here, though, were only
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with total carotenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this maize NAM population of 5,000
recombinant inbred lines, we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: really dissect down to the gene level,
the largest effect, QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you focus on this orange part,
so this is the amount of phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: variants explained by a priority genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray part is the amount explained by
those two genes that are novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are unresolved loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, we don't really know what
those causal genes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by seeing this, you could probably be
saying, well, why did you have to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: maize NAM population?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just done a candidate gene
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we didn't realize at the time is that
the known a priori candidate genes would
[SPEAKER_00]: explain the majority of the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the genes that are unresolved,
they explain about 1% or less of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those regions of the maize genome,
there aren't any a priori candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that we can certainly
follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a breeding context, they don't
explain that much of the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now when you think about breeding
for beta-carotene, which is the compound
[SPEAKER_00]: that has the highest pro-vitamin A
activity found in the maize grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: these five genes here are the ones that
you would focus on, BXS2, PSY1,
[SPEAKER_00]: Leike, and CRIT-RB1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can think of very much as this
is just reduced to a combinatorial
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just trying to figure out the
best allela combination to put together in
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding program so that you can
calibrate the composition and the total
[SPEAKER_00]: for the type of carotenoid phenotype in
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just these two genes that we have just
talked about previously that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the Harvest Plus breeding program,
they have been used to release new hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: in Zambia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an outgrowth of the orange
hybrid hypro-vitamin A maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some work that was published about
five years ago showed that this orange
[SPEAKER_00]: hypro-vitamin A maize was as effective as
providing vitamins to Zambian children
[SPEAKER_00]: that had low levels of vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't just that we were able to
select on the genes themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what was shown by nutritionists is
that this product, this orange
[SPEAKER_00]: hypro-vitamin A maize, is as effective as
giving vitamins to the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is one of the rare cases
where you work closely with the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the at-risk population, and you
understand their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that Harvest Plus
does very well so that after maybe eight
[SPEAKER_00]: to 10 years of developing a new hybrid or
a new embryo line, people will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the work now that we're
focused on is really on deployment of
[SPEAKER_00]: these genes and then understanding how
well these hybrids are performing under
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Christine, a former PhD in my lab,
worked for a year in Zimbabwe with CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is one of the field days that
they had where they were showing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public these new, at least, orange
pro-vitamin A in-bred lines hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then showing people how they look
after being cooked, and then they could
[SPEAKER_00]: taste them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an image from her drought test that
she was doing, and where about 300 hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: that were bred to be high in pro-vitamin A
were tested under heat and drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have all of this seed now in our
cold chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be analyzing it as well to see how
the composition of that grain was
[SPEAKER_00]: perturbed over time from the heat and
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on now to vitamin E,
this is a nice contrast here, because here
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that a priori, eight,
that is a priori pathway genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then six novels genes explain about
60% of the natural variation for
[SPEAKER_00]: topochrominal traits in May's grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have D-XS2, D-XS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you recall, those were hit for
karate notinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RADH2, HPPD1, SDS, VTE3,
HGD1, VDE3, and VTE4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the majority of the phenotypic
variation, though, is explained by a
[SPEAKER_00]: priori genes for tocotrinols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tocotrinol traits have high
antioxidant capacity, and that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the gene HDGT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found that novel genes were mostly
controlling the variation for tocotrinols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look down in this part of the
table here, so this would be like these
[SPEAKER_00]: snare proteins, fibrillin, this
transferase protein, and PhD gene here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with Dean de la Penna's lab in
Arabidopsis, dare I say, we've been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to confirm that some of these genes do
have a contribution to this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really nice, because we've been
able to take the gene from May's,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a line of Arabidopsis that no
longer has this gene functional to show
[SPEAKER_00]: the confirmation and recapitulation of the
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two genes that I would like to focus
more on now are the protochlorophyllide
[SPEAKER_00]: reductases, POR1 and POR2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a real surprise to us that we
found these genes to have a very large
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two genes, they're homeologs in
the May's genome, explain almost all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the variants for total tocopherols that we
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why this is intriguing is because these
two genes are involved in the chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have protochlorophyllide A.
[SPEAKER_00]: The POR gene is doing a reducing reaction
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the chlorophyllide A,
which lacks the vital tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's added through the GG here,
geranyl, geranyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the chlorophyll A and B
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where we begin to
hypothesize what may be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did analyze the embryo and the
endosperm of these developing May's
[SPEAKER_00]: kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found trace amounts of chlorophylls
that are present in the May's embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to remind you, the May's grain is
non-green, non-photosynthetic tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is chlorophyll A in it,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look here, this is days
after pollination here on this X axis,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 to 36 days after pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from the embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is average across the 25 NAM
parents here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the Y axis is a long concentration
of each of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tocopherols here, you can see is
increasing over time, but you do actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see chlorophyll A here, chlorophyll B,
and then a precursor of chlorophyll lide
[SPEAKER_00]: A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be more related to a
degradation product without the magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: pheophytin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to remind you that the
phytal group here is important for
[SPEAKER_00]: defining chlorophyll A versus chlorophyll
lide A right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you think about the amount of
chlorophyll that's found in the embryo
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the leave, the chlorophyll
tocopherol molar ratio is one to 800 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thus we feel that the chlorophyll
degradation is not sufficient as a source
[SPEAKER_00]: of phytol to generate the tocopherols in
the developing embryo of May's grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think is happening here is
actually a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hypothesize that the phytol for
tocopherols in embryos most likely
[SPEAKER_00]: provided through the chlorophyll
biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, just to draw your attention to
this plot here, this is days after
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the X axis and the correlation of
each of these different metabolites with
[SPEAKER_00]: the total amount of tocopherol here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we see a strong correlation over
the developmental time period for
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll A.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also chlorophyll lide A and
chlorophyll B, but we need not see a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong correlation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it is very weak for
pheophytonate A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this reaction right here involving
these pores is a strongly light dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we think is happening here is
that the phytol group is somehow being
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaved from the chlorophyll A and that
it's being used by BTE5 in the phytol
[SPEAKER_00]: re-salvaging pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what's leaving to tocopherols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, if the degradation of the phytol
was very important and very strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would think and hypothesize that the
pheophytonate signal here would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong, but we're not seeing that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this cycle to actually happen,
we have hypothesized that there are at
[SPEAKER_00]: least one or two more enzymes here to
cause this cycle to actually turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some leads and we've cloned
genes now that we think are filling out
[SPEAKER_00]: this pathway part right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing is that we have tested
that in this field, in the field season
[SPEAKER_00]: this year and also last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is a strongly light dependent
reaction, what we did is after
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, it was about five to 10 days
after pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our pollination bag on the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these foil hats that we're putting
on the ear so no light can penetrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: ear at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after, you know, comes October
and the first snowfall, we go out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take off those foil hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make sure that there was no penetration
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we analyze the samples with the
HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found here to test this
hypothesis is we think if it is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important reaction in involving these core
genes, that if you block out the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the amount of tocopherol should
decrease as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we saw in the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just reconfirming this year as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to complement that, we've also been
doing CRISPR of these two core genes as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you would expect, if you CRISPR two
important genes in a chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway, you would expect for
the CRISPR plants to be very pale and very
[SPEAKER_00]: green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are treating these plants as they
are our own children.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to ensure that we actually
get seed from them, and hopefully we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzing those by HPLC as well this
coming spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our hypothesis that we're trying
to confirm now with the chlorophyll cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the largest effect QTL for the
tocopherominal pathway has technically
[SPEAKER_00]: been resolved to the gene level and could
be deployed in breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see here, there's still a fair
amount of unresolved QTL right near there
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we're following up on our
PGRP pathway grant right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work is being carried out by Di
Wu and Ji Wu Li in our lab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt Pasezio has been talking about
this for about the past four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to leverage all of our
investment in understanding the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture of carotenoids and
tocopherominal, so pro-vitamin A,
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin E, and the important Xanthophils,
lutein and zeaxanthin, to improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's like winter and there's snow
on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about eating more highly nutritious
corn, of course covered in butter in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coming summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have done close to about 200
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have identified important genes
that are also key players such as Leike,
[SPEAKER_00]: CRIT-RB1, HDGT1, VTE1, and VTE4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about, you can have
these important haplotypes fixed as your
[SPEAKER_00]: cofactors in your GS model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can have the polygene effect
capturing that residual variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the prediction ability for
these phenotypes can be quite high in our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, in fact, do have a breeding program,
even though it's hard to believe sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: when I find time, we're actually out in
the field and it can be some very tasty
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping if you ever want to come join
us in terms of quality traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're going to begin to switch
gears to some of the high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping work that we've also been
doing in my lab over the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was driven out by having some
early discussions when I was doing my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: here with John Luke.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were, I was still trying to figure
out what is genomics selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would chat with John Luke.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be like, it's, you know,
your genotype and phenotype of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a population, this training
population, you train a GS model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then ideally, your genotype,
your breeding material, and try to predict
[SPEAKER_00]: what those phenotypes actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though you're doing that,
you still need highly accurate phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you still have to be doing phenotypes
as you retrain the models after say every
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four cycles as the allele
frequencies are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I began working on this,
because in Arizona, I was very focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to improve the heat and drought
stress tolerance of cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as with new nutrition, I think about
children and the vitamins they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, during the early part of
2010, through 2012, there had been
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated droughts, including in Texas here
in 2012, where a humble cotton farmer can
[SPEAKER_00]: just lose their entire crop from drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I quickly began realizing is
we needed a very effective way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic phenotyping for heat and
drought tolerance in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we began doing this when I was
working at the USDA was having this high
[SPEAKER_00]: clearance tractor right here to phenotype
canopy temperature NDVI, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a vegetation index doing
chlorophyll content, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, and then height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were testing this on a
recombinant ambrion line population of
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton, close to 100 recombinant ambrion
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had also phenotype agronomic traits at
the end of the season with a combine or
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton picker going through the field and
various yield components, fiber quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and physiological leaf traits,
epsizogacid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the epsizogacid concentration was here
at Cornell thanks to Tim Sutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing all this under drip
irrigation so we can have a highly managed
[SPEAKER_00]: stress environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would calculate how long and how much
of the irrigation should be applied for
[SPEAKER_00]: these two wet and dry regimes right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to do this phenotyping
over the entire growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say we would phenotype every Thursday,
and then we would do at four time points
[SPEAKER_00]: within that single day over the whole
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a sense, we really wanted to
understand how is this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: population responding to the imposed heat
and drought stress over time from at
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering to at the end of harvest when a
cotton picker would drive through the
[SPEAKER_00]: field and quantify yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we were able to do this is
essentially paint the genome to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL are turned on and off as a result from
the dry stress, the wet well water control
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the X axis here is the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this over three years,
2010, 2011, 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this X axis here is the position of
long genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these are a chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you can easily see here in
this very almost crazy painting if you
[SPEAKER_00]: will, is that you can see the time points
when certain QTL are turned on and how
[SPEAKER_00]: long that they're turned on for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of see if they're
turned on between years and across years
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red are alleles that are
increasing the canopy temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue are alleles that are decreasing the
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work was carried out by a former
postdoc who is now at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona as a new professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a nice candidate gene ABA,
but this is a large genomic interval here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a candidate gene you can always
hypothesize what may be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why ABA may be important is in this
context because when we had mapped the
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton leaf ABA content, the QTL mapped to
the same genomic location as this QTL that
[SPEAKER_00]: was turned on very strongly for canopy
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why that is important is as the stomata
are open, transpiration is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as ABA is expressed in the leaf and
becomes to a high concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual stomata close and transpiration
decreases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in effect, this could very much be
somehow linked to changes in the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in terms of variation in this
common recombinant inbred line population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is just indirect phenotype of a
trait such as really what you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get at is the amount of water in a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've been doing over the past two
years working with Wijun Liu and my lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and Piyush John and Abe Struck's lab is
developing these nanosensors that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: aqua dust to infiltrate into the leaves to
more directly quantify water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this is working is these have these
like small floor fur particles that are
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked on to these particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you infiltrate into the actual
leaf, they will expand and contract based
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaf water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the water potential is very low,
that means the plant is undergoing stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you would have shrinkage of
these nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these fret particles would begin
to interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would have a high fluorescent
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also did validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were showing here in this curve,
so this is like water potential from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've also maybe heard it referred to as
a pressure bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this is an actual work that you
actually have to like cut the leaf off and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in the pressure bomb and then
quantify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the y-axis here is a fret
efficiency of those particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see it's following this line very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this gave us confidence in telling
us that we are able to directly measure
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf water potential in the leaf using
these nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a confocal image here showing
the distribution of these nanoparticles in
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the aqua dust is
residing in the apoplastic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it's doing is providing a
measure of the local water potential in
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really, I think, one of the
first steps to really begin high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping of water potential
and its direct quantification of water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wouldn't have to do it through
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have to do it with a pressure
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in injecting particles in the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next part is going to be about
biotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happens when you hang out
with Rebecca Nelson.
[SPEAKER_00]: You begin working on northern leaf light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've become to learn and actually
call these lesions beautiful, because when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not showing up in our field in the
season, it is not beautiful, as we have
[SPEAKER_00]: found out this past summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus that causes these brown
necrotic lesions, these lesions can begin
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow and coalesce over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, NLB disease has
actually been beginning to increase over
[SPEAKER_00]: time since 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be high as a 1.9 billion
economic loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the case in 2015,
considering US and Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really a disease on the rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the challenges here,
and some of this work really began with
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse Poland when he was here as a PhD
student, same time was, is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you rapidly visually assess NLB
disease presence or severity, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative phenotype out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it often is very slow and imprecise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the case where this is our
NLB true positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our NLB true negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even just trying to see these lesions
by eye, assuming you're able to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive, one is very slow as you walk
through the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then quantitatively is also very
challenging when you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: severity, which is, in a sense,
disease leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here, this is the case of mean
intra-rater radiability, repeatability of
[SPEAKER_00]: only a 0.76.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like comparing the same
repeater to themselves, going from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, in week 10 to week 12, and then
seeing how close their ratings relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the inter-rater repeatability is
actually even lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not only slow, but it is
imprecise when you're trying to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitatively for a disease leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that we had, and this is
where, hanging out with computer
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, computer scientists and
engineers is very sometimes intimidating
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn their language and understand
what they're talking about at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as you get out your comfort
zone and you realize that they can do so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more to help your research,
then I'm hanging out with them all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and having conversations with them
every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was, and this is what a lot of
people refer to as machine learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is us using these CNNs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just think about using a CNN
is converting a pixel into a logistic
[SPEAKER_00]: unit, one zero presence absence of a
lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is essentially doing is
where we're applying these filters to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it's referred to as a
convolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pooling is really simplifying
the layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to convince this information
to allow more filters to be applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're extracting these multiple
layers of the non-feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then almost like an ensemble
classifier is combining all these features
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a prediction at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either the lesion is present or it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've been doing, and this has
been carried out by our wonderful pilot,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Hasmar, in the lab, is using the UAVs
to really speed up the large scale disease
[SPEAKER_00]: detection in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one of those UAV images right
here of some really nice lesions on these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with HOD's group at Columbia
University, Harvey Wu and Chad Deschanes
[SPEAKER_00]: and Tier here at Cornell, we've been able
to do highly accurate NLB lesion detection
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we have our trained CNNs,
we've been able to achieve an accuracy of
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 98% with a holdout test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were actually able to detect these
lesions, the presence of absence of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: very well out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to do severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make Rebecca Nelson happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what we've been trying to
do over the past two years, is make her
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're getting closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great people at Facebook have
developed what is called a MASC regional
[SPEAKER_00]: CNN, short for MASC-R-CNN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we began doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work is led by Ethan Stort in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see a nice lab photo right
here of us all happy and smiley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can run that MASC-R-CNN here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's running these classifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is you're conducting
object detection by drawing these bounding
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes around each class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're doing a segmentation
algorithm on each of these bounding boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: to classify a pixel as an object.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Ethan has been doing is really
trying to carry this forward into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant world from the Facebook world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have an image of a disease
lesion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is where it's been outlined by a
human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the MASC-R-CNN would
predict that there is one lesion here,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then drawing the area around that one
lesion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the IOU is the overlap in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one actually looks fairly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are cases when it does not look
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this looks like we have a piece of an
anther or a tassel here occluding this
[SPEAKER_00]: lesion right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where a human drew it very nicely
here and drew a part of this lesion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see, this piece of a tassel is
kind of confounding the AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to overcome that, we just need a larger
training set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ethan may have to drink more coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, so with the UAVs,
what we have begun working now within an
[SPEAKER_00]: EDDS group here is Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to really understand how
you use robotics for phenotyping and
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate them into plant breeding
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with Grish Chattery's group at
the University of Illinois
[SPEAKER_00]: Urbana-Champaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is on our TerraMEP project funded
by the RPE.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the intent was to develop this for
phenotyping biomass sorghum over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're now developing with our
lab is a comparative HapMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's trying to integrate the
evolutionary histories of maize and
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum to improve the predictions of
these complex traits in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jonathan here is here for one year
from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's beginning to do is develop these
Bayesian models that can use what is
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as forward training cross
validation, where you can say have a robot
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the field, but then you're
incorporating these time points early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season as part of your training set to
try to predict a phenotype at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this is height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using days after planting 30 and
45 days to train the actual Bayesian
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using that information to predict
height at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, as we've found, been able to
increase our prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about a height of a
phenotype phenotyping approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you begin to incorporate phenotypes
early in the season to improve your
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy so you can predict something such
as height or yield more accurately at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can think of this as saving time,
then you would know early on what crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: to make early in the season prior to
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Jonathan has also shown,
at certain later weeks after planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't much changing in the rank
order of those plants for height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having a robot makes you very happy,
as I have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ed would probably attest to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're really beginning to think
about and do here is trying to integrate
[SPEAKER_00]: these unmanned ground vehicles,
these unmanned aerial vehicles to really
[SPEAKER_00]: tangibly phenotype NLV disease presence
and severity from the understory to the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have now learned that the NLV
disease starts at the understory and it
[SPEAKER_00]: works its way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing it from the air,
it actually may be too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're now trying to work on is do
an in-sync phenotyping approach where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to integrate the information
from the ground rovers and the UAV to
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand the rate of disease
progression over the whole growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that in mind, and this is one
where hanging out with computer scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very fun, we're really thinking
about now a concept of a software-defined
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, where you are using the TV white
space and a software called FarmBeats and
[SPEAKER_00]: using that to eventually do end-to-end
image processing nearly in real time as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're collecting the UAV data or from the
ground rover to really understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases are breaking out and how you
would better manage your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is under the umbrella of CETA,
and this is with my colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: Makim, in computer science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of where we are beginning
to see and take hybrid phenotyping,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was once just thought of maybe we
would just focus on one trait,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really now beginning to think how
do we fully integrate this in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program, but how do we employ it to also
better manage our crop at the farm level
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do we sense and react at the same
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then you can think about having
like a UAV or a ground rover with highly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated candor sirs of like fungicide
or a pesticide that can have variable
[SPEAKER_00]: application through the field over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where to have that actually to
be possible would require something as a
[SPEAKER_00]: software-defined farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's a lot of people to thank and
funding agencies for the carotenoid work
[SPEAKER_00]: would be at MSU and Purdue University and
here at Cornell with Ed's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like CNN disease work would be HODs,
a group at Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peckin's group here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the EarthSense, that would be our
rover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the phenotyping early work was
involving colleagues at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona and USDA ALARC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I did not have enough
time to talk about the other 20 projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have going on in the lab,
because I didn't want this presentation to
[SPEAKER_00]: be just one slide for each project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also doing some, I think,
some great work in oat and cassava as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and other projects in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, I just didn't have the
time to go do a fast forward through all
[SPEAKER_00]: those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, take questions.
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a negative correlation between
vitamin E content or vitamin A content?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's actually something we looked at
very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so DXS2 and DXS3 are kind of the only
shared, I'll just call them precursor
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there isn't that much pleiotropy as we
previously had.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing in Harvest Plus is probably
going to begin, hopefully, breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: this is that since some of the
tocotriennals are very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidants, that you can breed for them
at the same time to help prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown of pro-vitamin A in the maize
brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been shown as sorghum
transgenically by the Pioneer group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually think we can do that
through breeding in maize as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Susan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to process the idea that
chlorophyll, if I understood it,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious how light gets to the
embryo within the kernel on the cob
[SPEAKER_02]: through the husk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, it must be obvious to
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a very low level of light that
can penetrate the husk leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how much light is needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it requires that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is something that we're trying to
figure out and follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have also done, I guess,
the counter part of our test.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how we had foil on the cobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also had years where we took off
almost all of the husk leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our hypothesis is that the tocopherol
should go up even higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I hope to have the answer
to you in like a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it a particular wavelength of light
that penetrates maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite possible since it is going
through like pale green husk leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned using the evolutionary
history of maize and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do exactly by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, so that's what I get for
bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're actually creating here is a
comparative HapMap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can think about the diversity
of sorghum, right, pie, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is using a machine
learning model where we have all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different sorghum pop gen parameters such
as row, you know, other recombination
[SPEAKER_00]: rates and, you know, other genomic
features.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is as we look at the
centenic regions between maize and
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum, we're, say, getting pie and gene
expression from maize as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to better predict the diversity
of patterns of sorghum using that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if this is the case,
where you are able to harness the centenic
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are more stable and shared,
and so the idea is perhaps there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the shared, if you will,
controlled of complex trade variation at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been playing around with this in
maize and rice for the control of,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, like iron and zinc variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually kind of turning out to be
very cool and very powerful where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: orthology between the two, and then we're
like, okay, there's a GWAS hit here,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a GWAS hit here, and then we're
able to kind of tease that out by just
[SPEAKER_00]: having like rice and maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can kind of think of it as the
same way when you're using maize and
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Jen, why I can't hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I like have to walk all the way
back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, for the NLB lesions,
can you distinguish them from other
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic stresses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've actually, I guess,
taken the easy route where we've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on lesions, but we know all those
lesions are just caused by the one
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as we begin to expand out and have
this to be something that's more
[SPEAKER_00]: transferable and more valuable,
we need to think about having the test of
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's like multiple diseases
present, and in the combination of A,
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic stress as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, though, and the thing
you have to keep in mind, at this present
[SPEAKER_00]: time, the humans are training the AIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the human can't distinguish the two
or the three or the four, then it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very hard to train the AIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, over time, as AIs train themselves,
they may be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are no other questions,
let's thank Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
