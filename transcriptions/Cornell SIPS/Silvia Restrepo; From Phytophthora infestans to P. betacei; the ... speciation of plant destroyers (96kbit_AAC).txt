[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very generous presentation, very kind
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so glad to return to Ithaca and to
the Plant Pathology Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met my husband in the Department of
Plant Pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son was born here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have very good memories of my time in
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they probably know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband will join me here in Ithaca by
the end of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really glad to come here and
see so many friends around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk today only about
phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry for the bacteriologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also work with viruses at some point
of my career, but I'm only going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about phytophthora today and only in the
case of solanaceous and phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worked also in other crops with the
interaction with phytophthora in avocado
[SPEAKER_00]: and other crops, but I'm going to focus
today in this interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my PhD, I work with the bacterial
disease, the cassava bacterial disease in
[SPEAKER_00]: South America and Africa, and developing
some resistance to the CBV caused by Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Mona Saxonopolis, but over many holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I came as a postdoc to
Bill's lab and then to Chris Mark's lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, I worked with phytophthora in
Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were studying the interactions
between the host and the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were interested in the compatible
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of labs were dealing with the
resistance, trying to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided to focus on the compatible
interaction where the disease is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started doing some studies with
potato and we found a role for the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: and hydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my first collaboration with
DTI, with a great Martin and people in his
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a role for these enzymes,
the carbonic and hydrates, that when we
[SPEAKER_00]: silenced these enzyme implants,
we saw that the pathogen, that
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora infestans grew more quickly,
indicating that suppression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonic and hydrates can increase the
susceptibility to P-infestans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was interesting, but more
interesting to me was that the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: group of teens suppressed during the
compatible interaction were
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to understand how or why we
can imagine that the plant shuts down the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis so the plant can dedicate
all the efforts to the resistance or to
[SPEAKER_00]: resist the attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to Columbia, we approached
this question with a more broader focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used this metabolic reconstruction
as a novel approach for this
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization of these interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a reconstruction of the
metabolism of the plant during the
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very, very, I think it's
amazing to see how the metabolism of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant changes during the time course of
the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here is a metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how the metabolism changes
drastically, and then it recovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it changes again, then it recovers,
and then finally the plant will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant is trying to adjust the
metabolism to resist to this attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a connection with the
photosynthesis through these pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing with these metabolic
reconstructions is that you can explore
[SPEAKER_00]: each pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's suppressed, or activated during
the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that probably one of the key
to this photosynthesis suppression was
[SPEAKER_00]: lying in the glutamate synthesis
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that glutamate is involved in the
chlorophyll synthesis and other steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we found a very good key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I couldn't continue this
study because we didn't have fonts for
[SPEAKER_00]: this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while I was here also in Cornell,
we did something that was probably very
[SPEAKER_00]: risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a transcriptomics analysis in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people probably thought at
the moment that we were crazy to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptomics analysis with plants in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, you are going to have so much
background of the expression, you will not
[SPEAKER_00]: see the differences in the response of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that our field in
freewheel had more flags than plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had to identify each of the
plants with the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we repeated these experiments five
times over the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could find some expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with a big background, we saw a lot
of expression coming only to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over that background, we could see
that some genes, and I'm showing only two
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, that showed an expression in the
resistant cultivar over the susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We silenced those genes, and we saw that
silencing those genes, they reduced the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in the resistant cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my studies here at Cornell and
with this study of these interactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have two take-home messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is like, we have to try to
integrate functional genomic information
[SPEAKER_00]: and biochemical knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see and understand the
properties that arise from the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the metabolic systems components
and in response to the environment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if the metabolic
reconstructions are the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are models, and models have their ups
and downs, and they're good things and bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we can see a broader picture
of the interaction with these metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that study, we collaborate with people
that have these metabolic reconstructions
[SPEAKER_00]: very well adapted to their systems in
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first time we were trying to do
it in a more complex genome, like the one
[SPEAKER_00]: in phytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one, and we'll continue
these studies in this, is that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: study your plant pattern interactions as
close to real crop conditions as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the highly controlled
environments, like the ones in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, grown chambers, may render the
plant highly responsive to non-treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: subtle environmental cues that will hide
the true responses to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed with our field in free will,
the field experiments, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: field-grown plants and used field-grown
plants does not preclude the detection of
[SPEAKER_00]: important difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to do your experiments as close to
real conditions as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2004, I moved to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colombia, my main focus of research
was phytophthora sensulata.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it sensulata, because when I
arrived, I tried to, I think I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: on only one species, that was phytophthora
infestus, and then we, end up with two
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you work in Colombia,
and Rebecca knows this very well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are complex environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have potatoes all year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, when you have the potato
field, you can have in the garden of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, all the other hosts of the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice, because you have the reservoir of
the inoculum going all year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have Cape gooseberries,
you can have Solano chitoense,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have peppers, you can have Solanum
betasum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have all the hosts of the pathogen
to the potato fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not surprisingly, when you start your
crop, the phytophthora shows up
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to study the pathogen in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last study of phytophthora
infestus, when I arrived in 2004,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last study dated like 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to see what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we studied the host, we did a
continuous monitoring of the populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show you some studies in the
population studies, genomics of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We studied the pathogenicity of very large
determinants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to end up my seminar showing
you some alternative ways to control
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora infestus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we wanted to establish all the
hosts in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these huge diversity of
Solanaceous crops in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to see which were the plants
to host phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could show them in these
Solanaceous crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in potato, we have the yellow
potato, that is Solanum fureja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some breeders call them Solanum tuberosum
subspecies fureja, that is the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: small potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tomato, three tomatoes,
and I'm going to talk a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: three tomato case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lulo, that is Solanum quitoense,
Cape gooseberry, that here you can hear
[SPEAKER_00]: all other names like Goldenberry,
I think, or Cape, I call it Cape
[SPEAKER_00]: gooseberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one species of Solanum, that is
Solanum enviana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started our population study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let me give you a quick guide
to understand the population of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, this is a clonal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, well, it's, the infestation is
heteroparic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to have the two mating types to
go to sexual reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually in South America, you only
find one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some countries, you find only the A1
mating type.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other countries, you find the A2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't find, it's very rare to find
the two of them in a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we study this pathogen as clonal
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all members that, a clonal leader is
all members descend from a single
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have US1, US2, US3, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the time US1 was first
described in the US, and so on in Ecuador,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clonal lineage is defined by
several markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The allosome genotype, the RFLP
fingerprint, mitochondrial type,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be 1A, 1C, and the mating type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have an isolate, you have to
run all the tests to see to which clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages it belongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my first study, when I arrived,
we published it four years later to my
[SPEAKER_00]: arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: We characterized the population in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, everything was EC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one found in Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it corresponded to the clonal lineage
EC1 that replaced the US1 population
[SPEAKER_00]: previously described 15 years before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the strains were A1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found among more than, in all my
life, I think I collected more than 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only found one that was the A2
mating type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was associated to Fisalis peruvian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I described the disease, I swear,
I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I couldn't infect Fisalis
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even came to Cornell to put it in a
field with a strong pathogen pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never got infected again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a mystery that still haunts me
at night, that is the phytophthora of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't see any other A2 strain in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was with the traditional markers,
the EC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used genes to describe the
population, to see how many haplotypes per
[SPEAKER_00]: gene we had in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used mitochondrial genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used nuclear genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an avirulence gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it was pretty like very
clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one haplotype most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Venezuela, it was so nice because
it was like the white and black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had one haplotype in Venezuela
and the other one in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some diversity, but most of
them were very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw this in the south of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: An explosion of diversity of haplotypes in
the south of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna come back to that story
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use what everybody was using
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2019, the microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, from only one clonal lineage,
EC1, we saw this explosion of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each color represents a genotype with the
microsatellites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in different locations of
only one state of Colombia, the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have one RFP fingerprint with 76
MLG's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to understand why we have all
these diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if corresponds to different levels of
virulence, we still have to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was nice because we could see or we
could answer the question if the
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypes were correlated with the region
or the location or with the genotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't see any association or any
relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the haplotypes that are in
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the haplotypes that are the
circles, they have different origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see them in different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could isolate different genotypes of
the pathogen from one genotype of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potato, of the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was not a correlation between
geography, neither geography nor the
[SPEAKER_00]: potato gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good thing after all this work is
that we, Carlos Newster, a plant breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: potato breeder, we could release last year
three new varieties resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these years, all these monitoring,
all these trying to identify the different
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals and variants help us to
identify the resistance in these varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: of output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also monitor the resistance or
susceptibility to different fungicides in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most common fungicide is
methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a very high rate of resistance
to this methanoxin in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very susceptibility to other compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was very amazing because in
Colombia, they spray by calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spray once or twice per week,
regardless of the conditions, regardless
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know that we are,
at least at that moment in 2019,
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't know that we had this high level
of resistance to these methanoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also studied the populations of tomato,
the populations of phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: impressions associated to tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found, and you see the ones in
tomato with this dark blue, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really separated from the ones from potato
that is in the light blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even you see in this network that they
could even be in a way to speciation,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't explore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are really not connected,
some of them, to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: population of phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: We studied a question that was proposed
very long time ago that the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated from tomato and potato have host
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we indeed showed that the strains
isolated from potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are inoculated in potato,
they cause more disease, higher level of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the isolates are isolated from
tomato and they are inoculated in tomato,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see a very strong host preference to
tomato than to potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we saw what was the resistance of
susceptibility of these tomato strains
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the US strains to three
different molecules, methanoxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: simoxanil, and fluke, we saw that we had,
again, high levels of resistance in our
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to methanoxin compared also to the
US strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colombia, we have high levels of
resistance to methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during those experiments, and this was
the work of Juliana Gonzalez here present
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Freilab, they discovered or they
described also in the Freilab a phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: that also was described a long time ago,
that is the methanoxin-acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow your isolates in different
concentrations of the fungicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that you can kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you take inoculum from a super
little concentration of methanoxin and you
[SPEAKER_00]: plate it in a higher concentration,
you see this very rapid acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to the fungis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it occurred, and it was Juliana's
paper during her undergraduate studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it occurred in different phytophthora
species and genotypes and seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: unique to this methanoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't show with other molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did a more in-depth study,
reanalyzing whole transcriptomic profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: of strains that were submitted to this
methanoxin in silico search for
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative full one subunit RNA,
full one subunit in the genome of BI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably phytophthora was using other
subunits to resist to this fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also did some QRT PCR profiles and she
analyzed also the small non-coding RNAs to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there was some epigenetics
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came up with this nice model that
first she saw that there is a pleiotropic
[SPEAKER_00]: drug resistance that triggers a primary
cellular response that maintains the
[SPEAKER_00]: pleiotropic drug resistance, but they were
also evidence of some epigenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite you to read her paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nicely written and it's a very nice
model of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let me go back to the story of
these phytophthora populations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: South of Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will remember that we have this
explosion of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to explore what was going on
with these populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, there were these species
described in South America and Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in Mexico phytophthora epomide,
phytophthora mirabilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in South America, we had this newly
described species that was called P.
[SPEAKER_00]: andina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably we were dealing with two
species in the South of Poland,
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora investens and phytophthora
andina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to know a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to literature and saw that
in 2000, Mario Eugenia Ordonis,
[SPEAKER_00]: a colleague of mine in Ecuador,
published this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was reporting another population of
phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't say investens, it was
sensulato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to P. investens, attacking wild
solanus species in A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attacking these species, he was A2,
the mating type for the first time in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecuador, with a new mitochondrial
haplotype, 1C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were neither pathogenic on
potatoes nor tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2004, this paper showed that
they discovered, additional to the 1A
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial haplotypes, they discovered
another lineage that was an EC2 lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: with A2 and 1C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, we had two clonal
lineages of P. andina, EC2, EC3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they didn't call yet P. andina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they were novel populations,
EC2, EC3, US1 with different mitochondrial
[SPEAKER_00]: haplotypes and different mating types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this paper was published on the
phylogeny of phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call it phytophthora andina,
a putative new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, and this is very important,
that ambitious gene sequences pattern of
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear DNA in P. andina would indicate a
hybrid origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because something was going on on the
nuclear DNA of this group of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my friend, Ricardo Oliva,
published this paper describing the
[SPEAKER_00]: species, phytophthora andina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we have this set of
strains, one EC2 associated with wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and the EC3 associated with
Solanum betasium, the tree tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, I didn't like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper, I talked to Ricardo several
times, and we sent a letter to the editor
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that there were not evidence to
define a new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because first, we saw probably two
different species of P. andina,
[SPEAKER_00]: one to the EC3 and EC2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we knew that there was something in
this diversity that was not a hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were probably talking about two
different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we took the data from the genomes of
the mitochondrial genomes, and we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were really different, these two,
one C and one A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in P. infestus, within the same
species, you can have different
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondrial haplogroups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these were really, and these were also
clustering with different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently, they were very divergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we run some genes, we couldn't
differentiate P. andina of P. infestus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this letter to the editor,
what we were saying is that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think there were enough evidence to say
that P. andina was a single species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colombia, a group in the south of
Colombia showed that with AFLP,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would show the separation of the ones
associated with Solanum betasium and the
[SPEAKER_00]: one with P. So we were dealing with
several species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to get several lines of
evidence to show that we were dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: different species, actually with three
different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing we did is to grow these
three species, what we believe they were
[SPEAKER_00]: the three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment, we call P. andina the
ones associated with the wild species of
[SPEAKER_00]: Solanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: P. infestus and P. betasium is the one
associated with the EC3 group associated
[SPEAKER_00]: to Solanum betasium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the EC3 group, and this is the
EC2 group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that when you use three tomato
agar, the P. betasium grows, P. betasium,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, grows very well compared to the
other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't grow at all in potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our first line of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did a lot of morphological
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that usually, well,
P. infestus sporangia look like this with
[SPEAKER_00]: the papilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the sporangia of P. betasei,
that is all of these, you couldn't see,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you see all spores, but you couldn't
see sometimes the papilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see some intermediate sporangia
without papilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also saw some difference in the
morphological descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did some phylogenetic studies,
and we could see that P. andina and P.
[SPEAKER_00]: betaseis were separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are in red the strains we
collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in green, we have the P. andina from
Solanum betasum that was described in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricardo's paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that they were separated with
different tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measured the content of DNA in the
three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that in P. betasei,
we have the double content of DNA than in
[SPEAKER_00]: the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here the summary of the
content in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have more DNA in the nuclei of P.
betasei than in the other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in population studies,
again, when you take the K, that shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: best feed, you can see the three
populations separating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can hear with this EAPC study,
you see really that they will separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: the three species separate with the P.
andina associated with EC3 clustering with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones isolated from three tomato in
connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we did all the infection
assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculated every body, every genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three species, we didn't have the
wild Solanum plants in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we couldn't inoculate, but we
inoculated in tomato potato and three
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed again that P. betasei only
can infect Solanum betasum but cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: infect the other host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that P. infestant doesn't go very
well in three tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final line of evidence as a
biologist is to show that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did all the crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hard work, Bill knows that,
to do all these crosses and see if we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the formation of all spores of hybrid
viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have pre-mating isolation or post
zygotic isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, I'm going to show you only the
results of the P. infestants P. betasei
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that the hybrid are absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some all spores are formed, but they are
not viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hybrids are absent and we have the
reproductive isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all these lines of evidence,
we could publish that we have a new
[SPEAKER_00]: species within the clade 1c associated to
the Solanum betasum in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So P. anina in reality is two different,
like was two different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: P. anina corresponding to the EC2 with
different microchemical genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And P. betasei, the one EC3 associated
with Solanum betasum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were in face of an ecological
speciations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three species are reciprocally
monophyletic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the final proof to have a new
species and the most probable scenario is
[SPEAKER_00]: speciation with a secondary code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and we, after that, we saw that
it is now clear that we needed a unified
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptual framework to properly define
the species in plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And characterize the divergent processes
in these plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to show this in this paper in
the annual review of phytopathology that
[SPEAKER_00]: studying the processes involving
speciation, it boils down to understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: the barriers to the genetics exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to show the reproductive
isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time is pre-mating because
there is one of the both of them cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: infect each other's host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this pre-mating isolation
because they are really isolated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you can have post zygotic
isolation when you don't have the viable
[SPEAKER_00]: all spores of viable hybrids showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to connect molecular taxonomy
with reproductive isolation to properly
[SPEAKER_00]: define the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we only show phylogenetic
species without showing if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier to these exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathogen host range appears to be
constrained by the pathogen effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: repel pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we haven't studied the relation
between the plant immunity genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: shaping the evolution of new plant
pathogen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the times there are the story
of ecological and geographical drivers we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to better understand of these events
that cause the reproductive isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we came back to the field to
see if this new species was only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: south of Colombia or was in other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that it's also is in sympathy
with phytophthora infections in the
[SPEAKER_00]: central part of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with more strains, we again
could demonstrate that we have the three
[SPEAKER_00]: different populations, P. infestens,
associated with different solanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the P. infestens, the tomato
strains that we have to study them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more because they separate from
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably remember that we have
twice the content of DNA in the nuclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went and sequenced the genome of
these new species and show that most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genome was a whole genome duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome of P. infestens is huge,
but it's mostly due to the repetitions and
[SPEAKER_00]: to all the transposons you find in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in P. beta-sa you find a whole genome
duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the context of the phytophthora
infestens are duplicated in the genome of
[SPEAKER_00]: the P. beta-sa, of P. betas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we studied all the effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different kind of effectors,
the apoplastic effectors, the critical
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, and the Rx RL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that some of them are in both
species, but some of them are unique to P.
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-sa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have to show if these unique
ones are the ones that allow P. beta-sa to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive in solanum beta-s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have in the three categories,
some of them that are unique to P.
[SPEAKER_00]: beta-sa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are shared and some are also unique
to P. infestens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them, and we found an
explosion of effectors in these genome of
[SPEAKER_00]: P. betas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the final minutes, I'm going to talk
about also we try to collaborate with some
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemists to find novel solutions to
control the disease, or control
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we focus in this pathway, the de novo
pyrimidine biosynthesis in phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two ways that phytophthora gets
the pyrimidine, with the de novo
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis, but they also have the salvage
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hypothesis is that phytophthora
uses the de novo synthesis during the
[SPEAKER_00]: biotrophic stages of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it goes necrotrophic,
it will go to the salvage path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to demonstrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why focusing on this path?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these enzymes have been attractive
for drug development in humans and in
[SPEAKER_00]: plasmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this compound has been used
to inhibit the fourth enzyme of the de
[SPEAKER_00]: novo synthesis pathway in some treatments
to autoimmune diseases in humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also other compounds have been used to
control the plasmodium falciparum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the malaria paraster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know that phytophthora is very
close phylogenetically to this malaria
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, to plasmodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays closer to this than to fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very close to the malaria
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer the first question,
we try to see the expression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes during the time course of the
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could show that the de novo enzymes
are all activated during the biotrophic
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the salvage ones are downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the salvage ones is the contrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, during the salvage pathway,
the de novo synthesis enzymes are
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm starting again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the de novo enzymes are activated
during the biotrophic and then
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated during the salvage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The contrary during the necrotrophic part
of the disease, that the de novo are
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated and the salvage are
upregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took one of these compounds I was
talking about, the one that was used
[SPEAKER_00]: against the human enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we first showed that the enzyme is
localized in the mitochondrion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tried to inhibit the growth of
painkillers with this compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we compare with the crusade that is in
front this side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we put increasing the
dose of the compound, we could inhibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very comparable to the fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something very important is we want to
show that the enzyme from the potato and
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme from the pathogen are different
sensitivities to the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, you see the scan, we show that
they have different sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is good because you will not inhibit
the enzyme of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will only inhibit the enzyme of the
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not inhibit the enzyme of the
host, only the one in the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my final take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colombia, agriculture is a very
important sector of the economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting for more than 16% of employment
and 7.5% of the gross product.
[SPEAKER_00]: With significant challenges, low
productivity, no data driven, low adoption
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of technology, no impartial
extension services, and only a very few of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gross domestic product is invested in
research in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highlighted the importance of
continuously monitoring the pathogen's
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the funding we had, you see that we
could only monitor the populations in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004, 2012, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do this continuous monitoring
of the pathogen population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to do that with the
appropriate markers that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: discriminating variants at the local and
global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that also with the Santa Monas,
and it's really nice how you can adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of discrimination adjusting the
use of the markers that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the importance of working with
breeders to select the pathogen's
[SPEAKER_00]: variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over my life, I work with breeders in
cassava and potato, and we also end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with releasing new resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to understand the relationship
between the genetic structure for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and the distribution of
pathogenicity and variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during my life, I also work with
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you some pictures of my
research with cordyceps, with amanitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with morels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found this in the grids of the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really interesting because we
could grow some in feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also studied the
microbiological diversity in endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have sampled palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have sampled plants in a very extreme
environments in the Paramos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is always thank you to my
collaborators around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but we can collaborate and
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it seems to be alabloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also published a paper before I knew
there was a new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published this paper with Nick Runewald
in Oregon State showing the high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygosity of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's an alabloid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for that wonderful
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also take my hat off to you for being
able to continue throughout with managing
[SPEAKER_02]: universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really, I mean, so much of that
is fascinating, but the fact that your
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium can grow on tree tomato agar,
but really cannot grow on hetodextrose
[SPEAKER_02]: agar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems sort of like either there's
something that it needs or there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something that it doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there sort of a straightforward
nutritional problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has to be with nutrition,
not only with the effect of repertoires,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been able to isolate pebetase
from potatoes in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put a little of that potato into the
tree tomato agar, does it crush its
[SPEAKER_02]: ability?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, probably something in the potato
that you cannot inoculate, like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: go in leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be, I think it's not only the
effect of repertoires, as I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something else.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your range of tree tomato?
[SPEAKER_05]: And is the topsoil of pebetase throughout
the range of tree tomato?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, but I can say that in the
metric system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tree tomato can go to very low,
well, not lowlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say from 1000 to 2000 meters above
the sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could find all phytophthora all
over the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because when I did this sampling,
I started in the Magdalena River,
[SPEAKER_00]: very like zero meters above the sea level
and went up to Bogota, that is 2600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could find isolates all over the...
I was doing another project in Collector
[SPEAKER_00]: Triton, but I was sampling also
phytophthora and we could see the
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora betase all over the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about south of the Argonauts?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done that, but then a paper was
published in Peru, showing different
[SPEAKER_00]: populations in using the phylogenetic
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some branches, and I think one of these
branches, they don't call it pebetase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think one of the clusters is
pebetase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we discussed that with my
friends in C.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do that, but then BTI
hired me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in the diversity in the
infestations that you see in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you attribute that to just the fact
that it can persist year round and all
[SPEAKER_03]: those folks are there, so it just
multiplies a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think there's some other factor
in saying that diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's plant biodiversity that we
have and all these solanum species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't... Well, most of Colombia is
not explored because of the problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: security we've had in them, but every time
I go to the field, I describe the new
[SPEAKER_00]: species of Fondue, of Amanita,
and I'm sure that in the plant side,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be also an explosion of
solanum species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when Mexico, and Bill described this
very well, in Mexico, you also have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of solanum species and they could describe
different phytophthora species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes with the host.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam?
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing is that there's no sexual
compatibility across the laptop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think whether you might see
afterspeciation, gene acquisition,
[SPEAKER_05]: patient, or whatever, that could
reestablish sexual content, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't file for merging,
it'd be really relevant to think about
[SPEAKER_05]: potential for divergent sets of factors
that come together as one species.
No,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's something that is probably very
doable right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with... I don't think there is
a good P&D genome right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do a lot of comparisons with P
&D because the genome that is available is
[SPEAKER_00]: not in good shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good thing to see the
coalescence and all the divergences of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effective repercussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can do that right now with the
genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't see any on the online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then let's thank Sylvia again,
and may I remind the students in post-docs
[SPEAKER_04]: there's lunch with Sylvia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere, somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
