[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon,
depending on where in the world you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to welcome you all to our third
webinar for the fall semester from NECI,
[SPEAKER_02]: the National Extension Climate Initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Curriculum Working Group's
webinar series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today's theme is electrification and
climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can hear from Brian Stewart,
Mark Pullman, and Sarah Brock from their
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to read bios that's all in
the registration information, but we know
[SPEAKER_02]: these people are amazing, and I'm so
excited you could join us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the National Extension Climate
Initiative?
[SPEAKER_02]: We serve as an anchor for extension
professionals, researchers, and partners
[SPEAKER_02]: to collaborate and collaborate on
climate-related issues, share resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: discuss barriers and opportunities for
advancing climate change programming and
[SPEAKER_02]: extension, and engage in professional
development opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are 100% voluntary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to join one of our working
groups, this is from the Curriculum
[SPEAKER_02]: Working Group, but there's also the
communications, the justice, equity,
[SPEAKER_02]: inclusion, and diversity, professional
development, partnerships, and policy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the evaluation committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find more at
nationalextensionclimateinitiative.net.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the fourth of the series.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had one on youth and climate in
September, 1890 land-grant institutions in
[SPEAKER_02]: October, and we have one on resiliency in
December.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put these into the link as soon as
I'm off for my part, but you can find it
[SPEAKER_02]: on our seminar series and on the
recordings on our YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is to segue that this will be
recorded and uploaded to our webpage
[SPEAKER_02]: around seven days after the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please use the chat for logistics and the
Q&A for questions of the speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We endeavor to start and stop on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not read bios.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aspire to be a resource of many
resources from which you can draw upon for
[SPEAKER_02]: your own regional work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hope you find at least one person
today that really resonates with you
[SPEAKER_02]: because we advocate for a new kind of R&D,
which is research and duplicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a heads up, this is what will be
happening in December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim Davis will be talking about building
climate resiliency through disaster
[SPEAKER_02]: preparedness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Megan will talk about preparing agents of
change for tomorrow in Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jack Voigt, who is an undergraduate
student, will be talking about some work
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's been doing for AmeriCorps on
filling gaps in coastal communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put those links in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there is another webinar about
efficiency and electrification that's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in November 19th on Cornell's
campus, which has similar and different
[SPEAKER_02]: topics, including pilots working on mobile
homes and farm energy audits, among other
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to stop share.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brian, do you want to launch?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Brian Stewart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as mentioned by one of the co-founders
of Electrify Now and this whole topic
[SPEAKER_03]: about whether electrification can be
thought of as a climate action or a
[SPEAKER_03]: personal benefit is near and dear to me
because it's basically at the heart of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we try to do in our communications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the short answer is both of
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm going to try to do today is
just talk to you about my experience of
[SPEAKER_03]: telling this story now for over five years
and what I've learned and what I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: most effective in ways in terms of telling
this story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this sort of dichotomy between climate
action and personal benefit is at the
[SPEAKER_03]: heart of the communications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we have that's
fortunate about this story is that because
[SPEAKER_03]: it means that there's multiple motivations
for people to get involved in this once
[SPEAKER_03]: they understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another dichotomy involved in
this, which I think is every bit as
[SPEAKER_03]: important, which is about the kind of
interplay between individual action and
[SPEAKER_03]: systems change.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think back to the origins of the
environmental movement in the 70s,
[SPEAKER_03]: if someone was saying, well, what are you
going to do personally in order to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: help protect the planet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the things that we had available
to us were about using fewer resources,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of depriving ourselves in some ways
of things that we wanted, like turning
[SPEAKER_03]: your thermostat down or taking a cold
shower or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about using less of things that are
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have this whole different
paradigm with electrification where your
[SPEAKER_03]: individual actions are accomplishing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But more importantly, you're sort of
disassembling the system that's at the
[SPEAKER_03]: heart of the climate change problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the potential to be building
parts of this new system that should
[SPEAKER_03]: replace it that promises a better future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I would like to always
keep in mind as I'm having this
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation is that I want to supply a
context that's both global because this is
[SPEAKER_03]: a big problem, it's a global problem,
but bring it back to a really personal
[SPEAKER_03]: level and realize that people have
different motivations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might be really motivated by a
problem that they're trying to solve,
[SPEAKER_03]: or they might just really feel excited
about embracing a solution that looks
[SPEAKER_03]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both those things are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then although facts are maligned as a
motivator for people to actually take
[SPEAKER_03]: action, I think that it's important to use
facts to our advantage and connect them to
[SPEAKER_03]: these more emotional drivers like health
and safety and comfort that are equally
[SPEAKER_03]: important in terms of the reasons why
people might actually take action.
[SPEAKER_03]: But connecting those things is helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a way for us to myth bust,
which is important to do without giving
[SPEAKER_03]: too much credence to the myths.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, you can really
understand this, but unless you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: good way of taking action, it's not that
helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I like to remind myself is that we
need to be able to explain people what
[SPEAKER_03]: these things are that you could do,
but also remove barriers for people as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as possible so that it's easy as
possible for people to do it because these
[SPEAKER_03]: things can feel complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a starting point, I've really
changed my thinking about how to begin
[SPEAKER_03]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to start with a picture of the
climate change problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really talk about climate change
that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really mostly assume people understand
it and are somewhat motivated because of
[SPEAKER_03]: their understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really launch into this from a
standpoint of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this came from my work with AARP,
where they were reluctant to go too hard
[SPEAKER_03]: on the carbon emission standpoint because
it felt political to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were comfortable if I talked
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as I couched it in terms of these
benefits that were economic and health
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits to their customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I realized that that's just a good way
to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are huge advantages to doing this as
a homeowner in particular, which is our
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of target audience, because it's
going to reduce your bills and make a
[SPEAKER_03]: better living experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also reduces air pollution in a
really dramatic way and carbon pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So depending on your point of view here,
all those things are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't shy away from this one fact,
though, which is so important to land
[SPEAKER_03]: because I don't think people really get
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some ways, in fact, when we started
Electrify Now, it was partly out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: frustration that I felt that it seemed
like all the popular media just wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about plastic straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was no conversation in the
public media five years ago about the
[SPEAKER_03]: importance of energy and the fact that
it's at the heart of this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really changed,
which is encouraging.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think people still need to be aware
of the fact that it's burning fossil fuels
[SPEAKER_03]: that are at the heart of this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there are other issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Land use, food production, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to downplay them and plastics
waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm not poo-pooing at it's just
that if it weren't for this fossil fuels
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, we wouldn't be here having this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also one of the things that's
most actionable as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to remind people that on the heat
side, there's this mythology that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: all grown up with the natural gas as a
clean burning fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is, the more we learn about
it is similar or potentially even worse
[SPEAKER_03]: than coal in terms of its climate impacts
because of methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Methane leaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a major source of air pollution,
which is virtually invisible to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also true that renewable natural
gas, although it's getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: airplay from the utilities, is not going
to save the day here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as renewable
methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not equivalent to renewable energy
because it still has massive environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bad news is we have to get off of
this thing that we've grown up with and
[SPEAKER_03]: which has been important to building
civilization for the last 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good news is there's an
alternative here that is incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable and is hugely economically
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost of creating new energy with solar
and wind is now lower than any other
[SPEAKER_03]: source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is true all over the world to
varying degrees because of local
[SPEAKER_03]: economics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on a macro level, this is absolutely
the case, which is one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: we are going to go here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, we need to go here as fast
as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is another story that wouldn't
have been true 20 or 30 years ago would
[SPEAKER_03]: have made this conversation impossible to
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that's been happening sort
of quietly behind the scenes is that
[SPEAKER_03]: electric appliances have become
unbelievably more energy efficient in our
[SPEAKER_03]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to point out these minimum
efficiency standards from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, if you look at this,
you'll see that gas furnaces and water
[SPEAKER_03]: heaters and all gas technology,
they're required by law to be 2% more
[SPEAKER_03]: energy efficient than they were 30 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: This technology literally hasn't changed
since the time of your parents buying
[SPEAKER_03]: these devices when we were children.
[SPEAKER_03]: But electric devices and particularly
those that can include heat pumps are by
[SPEAKER_03]: law at least 30% more energy efficient
than they were 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in actual fact, if you look at the
devices that we buy, they're more like 50
[SPEAKER_03]: or 60 or 70 or 100% more efficient than
the things that we would have been buying
[SPEAKER_03]: 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is true for anything that's
electric.
[SPEAKER_03]: The electric light bulb is kind of the
poster child for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these devices that we'll talk about in
terms of homeowners in particular all have
[SPEAKER_03]: massive efficiency benefits that are not
possible on the gas side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one of the reasons why if you look
at energy consumption in the United States
[SPEAKER_03]: at a macro level, it's essentially
unchanged in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though our population has increased
by 18%, we have 51 million more people
[SPEAKER_03]: living here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our homes are bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're almost twice the size that were
being built 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's 15 million heat pumps that didn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two and a half million EVs consuming
electricity that didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these data centers that are sucked up
huge amounts of electricity that didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: exist 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these other devices like
smartphones and computers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this that our electricity
consumption is flat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though we've added all these
consumption, it's because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiency that we're seeing with the
electric devices and this has not played
[SPEAKER_03]: itself out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is way more efficiency to be gained,
which is why I'm not concerned about this
[SPEAKER_03]: sound by the people say, oh, there's not
enough electricity to go around.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need more supply for sure, but it's not
as dramatic as people think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that is important for
people to realize is that while our
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity supply has been relatively
constant, the emissions from electricity
[SPEAKER_03]: go down and down and down as we add more
renewables all the time and get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: really polluting coal plants, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why at a macro level, this story
about electrification is so compelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why you hear this sound by that we should
be electrifying everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been sort of talking about it
primarily from a climate change
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, but it has these other
benefits that are almost too good to be
[SPEAKER_03]: true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Energy cost savings that we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about where air pollution comes
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, it comes from burning
fossil fuels as the main major source of
[SPEAKER_03]: air pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge consumer of water so that
fresh water, so we'll have more available
[SPEAKER_03]: flesh water if we get off of fossil fuels
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: This all leads to healthier people and a
stronger economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of reasons at the macro level to
be excited about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think it's important to use
this context framing and what it means
[SPEAKER_03]: personally, because you can be thinking
about that and go, oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in my home, in most people's homes,
60% of the carbon emissions that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible for as individuals comes from
burning fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually very possible to
eliminate all that, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the other 40%, which comes from
the food you buy and the things that you
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase, that's harder to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that takes other people to do that
for us, but we can take care of this
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The four biggest ones in most people's
lives are their electricity supply,
[SPEAKER_03]: their gas cars, their furnaces and their
water heaters.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the four biggest sources of
carbon pollution for any individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that would be on part of
this is if you fly a lot, that would be up
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for most people, these things make
everything else pale in comparison from a
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon emission standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the exciting thing is that when you
combine renewable energy and
[SPEAKER_03]: electrification, all these things can go
to zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's possible to do this today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get renewable energy into your
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's multiple ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get an EV and charge it with that
renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're creating zero emissions for
your transportation, same for your heating
[SPEAKER_03]: and your water heating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's economic benefits to these two
that we'll talk about, because when you
[SPEAKER_03]: roll this all up, what you see is that at
a household level, the average in the US
[SPEAKER_03]: is about 20 tons of carbon emission.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you electrify that home today with the
grid as it is, no renewable energy more
[SPEAKER_03]: than we have already, you would slash
those carbon emissions dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you add this renewable energy
thing, which is possible to do at an
[SPEAKER_03]: individual level, and it's where we're
headed as a country.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of states have laws now that require
this by very near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we're headed, that this home
would go from 20 to zero and along the
[SPEAKER_03]: way, save amazing amounts of money in
terms of energy costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs about $7,000 a year to run a home
on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about your electric bill,
your gas bill and the gasoline bill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the gasoline consumption for two cars,
which is average, that can be cut in half
[SPEAKER_03]: nearly by electrifying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, it's important to educate
people about the technologies that make
[SPEAKER_03]: that possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to be spending as much
time on that today, but this is one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I think is really important
for my work, is just to make these things
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because while they're not necessarily new,
most people are not familiar with these
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies that are fundamental to the
electrification movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each of them have their own benefits,
which you can talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can feel daunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to try to keep it simple for
people by showing them how they can clean
[SPEAKER_03]: up their electric supply, and then
thinking about all the things in your home
[SPEAKER_03]: that burn fossil fuels from your
lawnmower, which we'll hear more about
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my pet peeves, all the way to
your furnace, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those things can be replaced with
electrical alternatives that are better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can electrify your transportation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course, there's a justice
component to all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to electrify everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be hearing more about that today
from another speaker, which I like to
[SPEAKER_03]: remind people that's a certainly important
part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to this climate action versus
personal benefit thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talk about heat space heating and
heat pumps, the fact is that these devices
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to make you more comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many homes don't even have air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes along for the ride.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, if you replace your furnace
with a heat pump, but it also provides
[SPEAKER_03]: more consistent air temperatures that are
more well spaced out in your home so you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have as many cold spots,
etc., because it operates at a lower level
[SPEAKER_03]: of energy, but more continuously.
[SPEAKER_03]: That also means you get better air
quality, that more air through your
[SPEAKER_03]: filters, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's noticeable in homes that are heated
with heat pumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: From an economic standpoint, it's the
cheapest way to heat your home.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just no other technology that
competes with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between a gas furnace and a
heat pump will vary from place to place
[SPEAKER_03]: and home to home.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, it is the lowest cost way to
heat your home and by far the lowest
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon pollution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to point out to people,
because this is another myth, you do not
[SPEAKER_03]: need gas backup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in very cold parts of the country,
it's possible to electrify homes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alaska, Maine, it's happening with these
new efficient versions of heat pumps that
[SPEAKER_03]: can operate at very low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if you have a renewable energy
in your home or this is what's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen in the future, these devices that
are electric will produce no carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: emissions and that's just not possible to
do with the other technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people may say, well,
this is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I going to be the first person doing
this if I do this in my home?
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is that Americans are waking up
to the fact that electrification is a good
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and heat pumps are just better.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is data about sales of heat pumps in
the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that five years ago,
furnaces were massively outselling heat
[SPEAKER_03]: pumps and that's completely turned around.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2024, it's more like 60% of sales are
heat pumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do this, you're not alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're part of this trend that's
developing around embracing these
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people think that they understand
electric vehicles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they're just expensive and
maybe a little bit better, but the truth
[SPEAKER_03]: is they're safer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fewer fatalities associated with
electric vehicles.
[SPEAKER_03]: They perform better in every way and they
have these dramatic cost savings that make
[SPEAKER_03]: the sticker price that you might be
worried about pale or basically go away as
[SPEAKER_03]: an issue when you look at total cost of
ownership over five years, you'll save
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because of this fact, these are two
cars that are essentially the same cars.
[SPEAKER_03]: One's a gas and the other's electric.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see you get for $10 of fuel,
you can go three times as far with the
[SPEAKER_03]: electric version.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is why over the lifetime of this car,
you're going to save a ton of money as
[SPEAKER_03]: well as massively reduce your carbon
emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, all that can be zero if you're
charging with renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why, again, people are waking up
to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, EVs were about 8% of sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Oregon, it's more like 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't be alone if you do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just finally like to end by
saying, I think it's always important to
[SPEAKER_03]: give people idea about resources they can
turn to to help them to do this in their
[SPEAKER_03]: own home.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are three really good ones that I
use a lot, but of course, it depends on
[SPEAKER_03]: where you live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then finally, electrification is just
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's a powerful climate action.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's going to give you personal
benefits, but it's just better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why more and more people are waking
up to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: By doing this, you can be building your
part of a better future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we have a couple of
minutes for questions here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to talk fast to get through
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of material to cover,
but I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian, what is the most exciting thing
from your frame of reference about what
[SPEAKER_02]: electrification can do for us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the most exciting thing
about it is this no compromise aspect of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think people are used to this
idea that if you want to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: that's good for the planet, you have to
sacrifice somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I applaud that idea of living smaller and
consuming fewer resources for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's fair to say that that
idea has not been successful in the world
[SPEAKER_03]: in general as a solution to our problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I love about electrification is it's
a little bit of a cake and eat it,
[SPEAKER_03]: your cake and eat it too kind of solution
from the standpoint that it's the most
[SPEAKER_03]: powerful climate action that people can
take period.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing else like it in terms of
how much impact it has.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really come along with any kind
of major sacrifices and really not really
[SPEAKER_03]: any behavior change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's the other thing that I
talk a lot about is that people don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: to change your behavior, but a Navy isn't
a behavior change.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still driving the way you used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that now you're creating fewer
problems by having access to personal
[SPEAKER_03]: mobility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can have this whole conversation
about should we be transitioning to more
[SPEAKER_03]: public transportation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really solves problems that people
have in terms of just being able to do
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're doing, but in a way that
produces fewer downstream issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of questions now in the chat
and they're all about losing incentives or
[SPEAKER_02]: changes incentives or maybe an increase in
incentives with the new administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts about how
important?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking from the federal to the state
level and the personal and business level,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are your thoughts on are the
incentives necessary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need to rely on them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they might get bigger?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I'm as fearful as anyone
that we're going to lose momentum on this
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've gained over the last five years
under the Biden administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't get credit for how much
they did in an amazing way that we still
[SPEAKER_03]: won't see the effects of it for a year
still.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say this trend towards
electrification started and really started
[SPEAKER_03]: picking up some momentum well before these
incentives were available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not fearful of it changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fearful of it slowing down because we
don't have time for things to slow down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also feel like this is a time where
the states are going to have to step up
[SPEAKER_03]: and do as much as they can to plug the gap
between what is may start to deteriorate
[SPEAKER_03]: at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we need to switch.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some questions if you want to
answer them in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And could you also put the links that you
showed on that next to your last slide
[SPEAKER_02]: into the chat as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark, will you please share screen and
come on board?
[SPEAKER_02]: And while Mark is doing that, I just want
to comment that my 87 year old mom just
[SPEAKER_02]: bought an EV car because her 22 year old
Corolla was dying and she was fearful and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was without incentives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really inexpensive used car,
Chevy Bolt, and I'm not trying to advocate
[SPEAKER_02]: for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying there are so many benefits
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most inexpensive cars out
there right now and it happens to be
[SPEAKER_02]: electric and it happens to run off of the
solar on her roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying it's not high tech,
scary or expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mark, take us away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for inviting me to
speak on this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Mark Pullman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a board member of the LOSN,
which is Lake Oswego Sustainability
[SPEAKER_04]: Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to speak today on our
campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're calling Electrify Your Landscaping
Healthy Yard Care.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's clean, it's quiet, it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit about LOSN.
[SPEAKER_04]: LOSN is a community based nonprofit
volunteer organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we network with nonprofits,
businesses in the area, local government
[SPEAKER_04]: and schools.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our purpose, we've been in existence
for about 12 years and our purpose is to
[SPEAKER_04]: promote sustainability in Lake Oswego.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lake Oswego is a small suburb of Portland,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Portland has a population of about 630,000
and our population is about 40,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are so surprised to find that the
utilization of gas powered lawn equipment
[SPEAKER_04]: or landscape equipment is quite
detrimental to our community and to our
[SPEAKER_04]: climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: One hour of running a gas powered lawn
mower is equivalent to running 300 miles
[SPEAKER_04]: of a car going from like LA to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one hour of leaf blower use is the
equivalent of driving 1,100 miles or from
[SPEAKER_04]: LA to Denver.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mind boggling to my mind, but it does come
from the California Air Quality Management
[SPEAKER_04]: Board and is quite believable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is smog forming pollutants,
all comers.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the main disadvantages to gas
powered landscape equipment is the extreme
[SPEAKER_04]: noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Noise created by gas powered landscaping
equipment is about four times louder than
[SPEAKER_04]: electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look at decibel levels in the
environment, it is a logarithmic
[SPEAKER_04]: measurement, which means for every 10
decibels that you go up, it's twice as
[SPEAKER_04]: loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most electric landscaping equipment run at
a decibel level of about 55 to 75.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most gas powered landscape equipment run
at about 75 and go up to as high as 120.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of which, the gas powered landscape
equipment has a low pitched hum or sound
[SPEAKER_04]: that penetrates walls and windows much
more efficiently than the higher pitched
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds do and can affect up to 90 homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas electric equipment, it does have
some low pitch sound, but it can affect
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe six homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: A decibel level above 85 can be harmful
when exposed to that over approximately 15
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So OSHA, EPA have put levels of which
unprotected ears should not be exposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: decibel levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see that down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gas powered landscape equipment exude a
lot of toxins, volatile, organic,
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds like benzene, butane,
formaldehyde, and also a very dangerous
[SPEAKER_04]: particulate matter, small particulates
called hydrocarbon PM2.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Electric landscaping equipment doesn't
exude any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When using the gas powered blowers in and
of themselves, they do stir up dust and
[SPEAKER_04]: fecal matter and other stuff that's on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll talk a little bit about how to
avoid that in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparing gas and electric landscaping
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Electric, it's instant on and off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gas, you got to pull a cord.
[SPEAKER_04]: For starting the engine, often we'll have
to prime it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to refill the gas and oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to transport the gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to fill the gas cans and transport
them, often in your car.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sloshes around in the car with all
the smell in there, whereas you don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: to do any of that with electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have to charge batteries and
transport those batteries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't have to winterize your
equipment with electric landscaping,
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas if you don't winterize your gas
powered, you're going to have a gummy mess
[SPEAKER_04]: in the springtime and you're going to have
a big bill cleaning it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Annual maintenance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spark plug changes, air filter changes,
fuel filter changes are all gone with the
[SPEAKER_04]: electric landscape equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiple tools can be run on the same
battery so you don't have to buy separate
[SPEAKER_04]: batteries for the different equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And batteries are becoming longer and
longer as far as the run times go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally changed my gas powered lawn
equipment to electric several years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I absolutely love my lawnmower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You turn it on, you turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no smell, no gases that come out
and you have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's easier to push.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all in all a plus for your
landscaping equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you'll hear that they aren't powerful
enough for our landscapers, for our
[SPEAKER_04]: industrial landscapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, many companies are creating
powerful electric equipment anywhere from
[SPEAKER_04]: ego to steel to Makita.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these have all been field tested by
AGSA, which is the American Green Zone
[SPEAKER_04]: Alliance, and are certified for our
landscapers for their use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, another comment is that the purchase
price of the electric equipment is higher
[SPEAKER_04]: than the gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like we were talking about EVs being
more expensive than the gas powered models
[SPEAKER_04]: at this point, although they are going to
be lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you'll note that when looking at
this is just one brand steel.
[SPEAKER_04]: The steel BR500 is a gas powered blower
and the steel BGA 200 is an electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll notice that the CFM is almost
identical.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a little less wind speed out of
the electric than you do from the gas,
[SPEAKER_04]: but very, very minimal differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, people say that they are too
expensive to replace and operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: When looking at the economics of replacing
gas blowers with electric blowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take one example here of an electric
blower that costs about two grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll give the landscaper the benefit
of the doubt that they have a gas powered
[SPEAKER_04]: blower now and they're going to replace it
with electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they they put out two grand at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 10 and a half months, they you will
find that the electricity hold on one
[SPEAKER_04]: second here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get my pointer out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll note here that the steel 500 costs
500 nights, 600 bucks, and the electric
[SPEAKER_04]: blower costs $2,200.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you look over the cost over five
years, you're going to save a heck of a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of money with the electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: It costs about $13,000 for your gas elect
your gas and your and your oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas the electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: This includes your electricity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So annualized cost is about $500 for $600
for your electric and $2,700 for your gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So over 10, 10 and a half months,
you've actually paid for your elect your
[SPEAKER_04]: electric blower and savings of about
$2,500 a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another another penciling out of costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a blower that costs $2,500 here
and we have a gas blower that costs $530.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two year fuel cost running at 1920 hours
for which is four days a week,
[SPEAKER_04]: four hours a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: With your electricity costs about 384
bucks versus the gas and the oil and the
[SPEAKER_04]: like 5600.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ultimately, you're over two years,
you're spending twice as much with your
[SPEAKER_04]: gas blower than you are with your
electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next problem is that they say is
the upfront costs are too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to put our small business
owners out of business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we need to do is we need to look
at some sort of a financing situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we know that equipment is not paid for
upfront, all at once out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually financed over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we need to do is we need to take a
look at loans, perhaps for our small
[SPEAKER_04]: business people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small business administration has micro
loans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have in Oregon, we have a new a new
loaning situation where, where we are
[SPEAKER_04]: making micro loans to landscapers and for
individuals who are winterizing their
[SPEAKER_04]: homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're, we're looking to to use that in
our small community too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also need to look at community grants
for the small landscapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also know that large retailers such
as steel often will give interest free
[SPEAKER_04]: purchases and payments over the course of
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, you pay for it with
the savings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people say, oh, they're still too
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is what is the cost of inaction,
the human cost?
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect these things expel toxins,
which can cause cancer, pulmonary disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: heart disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: The the decibel level of these things
cause hearing loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just don't want to, we just don't
want to tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what can we do as individuals and as
groups?
[SPEAKER_04]: To alleviate this problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that we can simply not use blowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can use brooms and rakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can buy electric tools, which are
affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you've seen, they're affordable,
clean and effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can hire landscapers in our in our
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people have landscapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can hire landscapers that who
use electric tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those we have a list and we've
worked with quite a clean PDX.
[SPEAKER_04]: To create a list of landscapers who use
only electric equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very difficult to get into them
because they're they're filling up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also buy our own electric tools at
our home and loan them to the landscaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the landscaper gives us the the labor
and we give them the tools to do the work
[SPEAKER_04]: in our particular home.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also purchase batteries to charge
at our home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can own the equipment and
just change out the batteries as they
[SPEAKER_04]: come.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also care for our care for our
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xerces Society has a campaign for
leaving the leaves because they care for
[SPEAKER_04]: our soil and plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They avoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to avoid herbicides and
pesticides, which can be harmful to our
[SPEAKER_04]: children, pets and wildlife.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can leave these leaves,
which actually builds the soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: builds mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We clean the hardscapes, but leave the
leaves in the planters.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also take action and become
involved in local and national groups that
[SPEAKER_04]: are working toward a better cleaner home
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the Xerces Society and the Leave
the Leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can certified habitat, backyard
habitat can certify your backyard for for
[SPEAKER_04]: renewable and sustainable yard care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've created a gas free landscape
program here in Lake Oswego.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have electrification fair.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an electrification fair and
encourage the use of rakes and brooms we
[SPEAKER_04]: call it the sound of silence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've also created a community action
group, which we're doing letters to the
[SPEAKER_04]: editor on an ongoing basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're forwarding those letters to the city
council.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an electrify your landscaping and
healthy yard care committee within LOSN.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we ask for donations.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the local area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have our signs that we would
like people to put up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also worked with other groups in the
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Watershed Council, Lake Oswego Watershed
Council has a urban forest tree summit
[SPEAKER_04]: that we just participated in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also invited to our electrification
fair, both landscapers who utilize utilize
[SPEAKER_04]: electric tools and also and also electric
tool manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a sustainability fair within Lake
Oswego also.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you'd like to know more
information, here's our here's our
[SPEAKER_04]: website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Lake Oswego Sustainability Network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was wonderful, Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just curious, Mark, what is your
favorite difference from using an electric
[SPEAKER_02]: landscaping equipment as opposed to gas
powered?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is your favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what what's the nicest thing about
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the instant on and off and the and
not having to manage the gas through the
[SPEAKER_04]: through the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our usage drops at our home in the
wintertime, of course, and even utilizing
[SPEAKER_04]: stay bill in in the gas really didn't
help.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always were we always were all gummed
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was always a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Sarah, will you start sharing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll ask one more question of you,
Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just talk about a little bit how
you're advocating for the landscaping
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses to to move over to electric
equipment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have to say, I live in an
apartment building and I notice a big
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between electric landscaping
and gas powered landscaping around me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're we're actually going to the
end user.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to people who who are hiring
the landscapers and encouraging them to go
[SPEAKER_04]: to electric landscapers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we've reached out to landscapers in
general, find out if they have the option
[SPEAKER_04]: for electric.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we put it on our website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also looking working.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also beginning to work with Seeds
for Soul, which is which is a funding low,
[SPEAKER_04]: low interest funding group to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just beginning that process and
we'll probably work on that next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bringing bringing the community together
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of adopt adopt a landscaper,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will donate some funds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll ask the city to donate funds and
then we'll get some micro loans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And between the three of us, the three of
them be able to help the low income,
[SPEAKER_04]: small landscapers weather the storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I just want to say that I'm going to
put into the chat a cost comparison that
[SPEAKER_02]: NYSERDA has done for greenhouse gas
emissions and the cost for different kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have to go onto the second tab
of of the first link, like it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: download an Excel spreadsheet,
but it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like me to take it away,
Jenny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last speaker of the session for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Sarah Brock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a program in New Hampshire that we
call the Energy Circuit Riders program,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to explain what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way through which we are trying to
help funds and action get into our more
[SPEAKER_00]: rural communities in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a fairly rural state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason I'm here is because
Jenny's mom is on one of the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: committees I work with in rural New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to represent the Northeast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Clean Energy New Hampshire is a
nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are striving towards a decarbonized
energy system for New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, that means that we work on
anything related to renewable energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy efficiency and electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a North Star that relates to
equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't talked a lot about that today,
but the three sentences that are run
[SPEAKER_00]: through my mind all the time are these
guiding principles that rates and costs
[SPEAKER_00]: must be affordable for all, that the
system should distribute the burdens and
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, economic and environmental
burdens and benefits fairly, and that the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy system should be secure and
resilient and reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run our education outreach technical
assistance side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our Energy Circuit Rider team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do a lot in policy advocacy and
stakeholder engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a whole lot of members across
the state, individuals, industry members,
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities, planners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are in a relatively small state,
and we sort of are the organization
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on this, that we don't have many
other peers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My team, the Circuit Rider team,
provides direct hands-on technical
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance to communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a program that started in the
North country of New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Melissa here, who's our
original Circuit Rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept was that a lot of the
communities, particularly in our Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: region, are very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking 500 residents or 1,000 or
1,500 residents, three member volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: select board running the town,
and maybe a part-time administrator
[SPEAKER_00]: opening the mail and processing taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no capacity to help the town put LEDs
in town hall or consider a solar project
[SPEAKER_00]: or any of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the projects that we were seeing
some of the more populated towns be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some grant funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hired someone to be a traveling staffer
who could provide some expertise and some
[SPEAKER_00]: project management support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was incredibly successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We managed to expand that to four
municipally focused Circuit Riders that
[SPEAKER_00]: each live and work in their regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the North country,
we call the seacoast in the Southeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a couple of those counties in the
Southwest now each have someone on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground working out of their home that is
going to select board meetings and
[SPEAKER_00]: planning board meetings and creating
energy committees and trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: projects done that save money for the town
and therefore trickles down into the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept here and the work that we do,
which started with municipalities and as
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see has grown, really has to do
with the rural nature of our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We experienced some of the highest energy
burden in the nation because we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very reliant on oil and propane to
heat our homes and cold climates mean heat
[SPEAKER_00]: pumps were slow to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we are certainly seeing a lot
more adoption of heat pumps for primary
[SPEAKER_00]: heating now, which I'm thrilled about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also just have very small communities,
which means at the municipal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little capacity to get projects done,
but also very little capacity to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: word out about programs that could help
residents to take action and we see
[SPEAKER_00]: programs rolled out in the state that just
don't get beyond a couple of populated
[SPEAKER_00]: centers in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our team effectively is bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identify what the programs are,
we develop the technical expertise and
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity internally, and then we're
translating and supporting our partners
[SPEAKER_00]: through these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, because you're not here to talk
about municipal energy projects
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily, my team is trained to do
anything and everything that's necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: to support a town through the process of
identifying and then having the voters
[SPEAKER_00]: approve an energy saving project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those projects do have to do
with electrification in some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we are shifting their electrical
source to solar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens a lot on putting solar on
the town hall or on the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: covered landfill sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of efficiency projects, a lot of
increasing number of electric vehicle
[SPEAKER_00]: procurement and electric vehicle charging
projects, but a lot of talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll breeze through this, but you can see
sort of a glimpse of the kinds of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also work with small businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a grant from USDA to provide
technical assistance for businesses who
[SPEAKER_00]: could be eligible for the renewable rural
energy for America program, renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: energy for America program, one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a program that allows small
businesses and ag producers in rural parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the country, which is most of my state,
to access currently 50% of project cost
[SPEAKER_00]: for renewable energy and energy efficiency
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are out talking to business owners
every day, helping them navigate the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, both of applying for the grant
but then also just putting the project
[SPEAKER_00]: together generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we deal with the same capacity issues
where these are small business owners who
[SPEAKER_00]: do not have the time of day to go
researching and getting contracts with
[SPEAKER_00]: contractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to hold their hand through
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's just another spattering of the
kinds of projects that we've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to helping, so the Inflation
Reduction Act was obviously game changing
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about this,
but one of the most impactful from our
[SPEAKER_00]: work has been the elective pay program,
which for those of you who don't work with
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities or nonprofits, this allowed
agencies like municipalities and
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofits that don't have tax burden to
still access the clean energy tax credits
[SPEAKER_00]: through a direct payment from the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has meant that our communities and
our nonprofits have access to an unlimited
[SPEAKER_00]: funding source that's non-competitive to
help move projects along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been game changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a number of other programs
and funding, often linking back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: IRA, that part of my organization's
mission is to make sure that dollars land
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our neighboring states have state
agencies and federal funding czars whose
[SPEAKER_00]: job it is to make sure that all federal
funding that could land in the state does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that in New Hampshire for
various funny political reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my organization sort of tries to do
that as best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these funding sources come across
where we're analyzing, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's eligible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they know they're eligible?
[SPEAKER_00]: What needs to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of technical assistance do
we need to deploy on the ground to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure those dollars land in the hands of
the folks who are meant to receive them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking into the next year,
I cannot speak to whether this was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change her last week's election
results, but in New Hampshire,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been anxiously awaiting our state
Department of Energy's program to deploy
[SPEAKER_00]: the home electrification and appliance
rebates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's a nationwide
program, but every state has been asked to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with their own plan to deploy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Hampshire, this is going to mean,
I was just looking up the dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to mean somewhere around $70
million landing in our state, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot that will go directly to residents,
individual end users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is specific to
electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the part that my team is most
excited about is rebates that will help
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase heat pumps and other,
you know, all of the appliances you heard
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian talking about earlier, there will be
significant rebates for on a level that we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen that combined with a couple
of other incentive programs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down the pike in New England should
make it possible for us to go out and be
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering this electrification measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we heard Brian share.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have the structure to do
that well in New Hampshire in these rural
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have been working with our energy
committees and our local partners to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about when this lands, how do we make sure
that these programs, which are designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be utilized by low income residents,
actually, can we get those programs to
[SPEAKER_00]: those low income residents and hold them
through their hands through the process of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually utilizing them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know from history, that these
programs are difficult to deploy
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively in the populations that you
want them to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're thinking a lot about that
proactively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of what we are doing right now,
we have a funding tracker that we track
[SPEAKER_00]: with our partners as these programs come
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are researching them and trying to
identify who needs to know about them and
[SPEAKER_00]: who needs to go after them as a coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have worked with statewide partners to
make sure that when the partners in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state go after them, that they know who
needs to go after them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also working with the federal
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often it's ending up that my program is
being tapped to as a write-in so that not
[SPEAKER_00]: only is the program being applied for,
but there's some money being set aside for
[SPEAKER_00]: technical assistance as part of the
program rollout plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that that's necessary in
New Hampshire for these programs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really advocating with our
communities to have shovel-ready projects
[SPEAKER_00]: to put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means figure out where in town the
EV charger is going to go, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know when the grant program could
land that would make money available to
[SPEAKER_00]: help you implement that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually when grant programs are
announced for communities, there's a six
[SPEAKER_00]: or eight week turnaround, which is not
enough time for most small municipalities
[SPEAKER_00]: to come up with the idea, get a contract
with a vendor, and put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated federal grant proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're supporting communities in
developing folders of shovel-ready
[SPEAKER_00]: projects so that they're ready to jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are forming and strengthening local
volunteer energy committees and
[SPEAKER_00]: commissions, which is a model that's very
common in the Northeast, where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: elected in New England, we have these
select boards that are elected in most
[SPEAKER_00]: towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the select boards can appoint energy
committees of volunteers who then can go
[SPEAKER_00]: off and do the busy work of putting
together projects to then present to the
[SPEAKER_00]: voters at an annual town meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we create these committees,
we support them, we help them do their
[SPEAKER_00]: homework for their select boards and their
voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help those committees set up capital
reserve funds so they don't have to wait
[SPEAKER_00]: till the next town meeting necessarily to
take action on a clean energy project.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all somewhat unique rural New
England problems, but we are actively
[SPEAKER_00]: working proactively to address them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also doing some kind of
creative organizing on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with some of our local
partners and a local utility here to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at bringing batteries to local emergency
shelters in some of our hill towns where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can have prolonged outages and we put
solar on these roofs and can we maybe rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on batteries instead of diesel to provide
that backup power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started working with local libraries as
hubs for information around
[SPEAKER_00]: electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: The libraries are very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see this as a way to have more
reasons for people to come in the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they need partners because they are
not experts in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with some libraries right
now to see what kind of programming we can
[SPEAKER_00]: help them run to get the word out about
programs and electrification
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some towns piloting a coaches
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rewiring America runs a coaching training
and we've got some volunteers who have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone through that training and we've got a
growing list of residents who have done
[SPEAKER_00]: some electrification on their own and are
willing and excited about talking to their
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're standing up a program that's
doing some matchmaking in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that goes well, that's something
we're hoping to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing coordinated public
outreach campaigns in various communities
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy committee that Jenny's mom is
part of has done a lot of solarize and
[SPEAKER_00]: weatherize campaigns with my help in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a model that we found really
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing more work with
resident-owned communities, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile home communities in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of those communities that
are owned by their residents and are
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly looking at community solar
projects and electrification across their
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some grants to help with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting creative to get these
programs and these solutions out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hands of people who need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Takes a lot of coordination and effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thoughtfulness at the local level in
my experience, but there's a lot that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just admire your program so,
so, so, so very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are connecting the dots in ways that
are so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially for rural communities,
because New Hampshire, like the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: state is like a million people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a specific kind of place-based
learning, collaboration, and integration
[SPEAKER_02]: to connect the dots for funding and
implementation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can other places think about what
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can they research and duplicate what
you're doing in order to meet,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in Florida, they'll have
different kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Oregon, they'll have different
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Iowa, they'll have different problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just feel like you're connecting
the dots in important ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we, how can we follow or be
inspired or like, how has it come together
[SPEAKER_02]: in your head to make these kinds of things
connect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything that I'm working on
started with the question of what do we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see and why isn't it happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Circuit Rider program was created
because someone looked at these little
[SPEAKER_00]: towns in the North Country and said,
none of these towns has has switched out
[SPEAKER_00]: their streetlights for LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes perfect financial sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just the, the capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we identified the problem and
we, we tried it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We plugged the hole in a teeny little
pilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we extended it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Solarize and Weatherize programs were
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why is there, we got data from the
state and it said that nobody on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut River was subscribing to the
New Hampshire Saves program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we put together a program and
we talked to the installers who were
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to do business there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked to the NH Saves folks and we
put together a program and we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we changed the narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think wherever you are in the
country, surely you have one of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: why isn't this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And get the people around the table who've
got perspective on it, including the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to reach and come up with a
solution that's worth trying at a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: that's possible to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: David, will you come on and ask your
question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, Sarah and also Brian and
Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question, speaking as a member of the
National Extension Climate Initiative,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sponsoring this and represents
the resources of the land grant university
[SPEAKER_01]: system, broadly speaking, what,
what can we and the sort of bridging
[SPEAKER_01]: organization between community and academy
and the academy, what can we do better
[SPEAKER_01]: that would help the work that you're doing
in places on the ground more effectively?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also just curious whether any of
you already have connections with
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative extension people in your
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just note briefly that in New
Hampshire, our extension runs a nature
[SPEAKER_00]: group community program that I just love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a volunteer matchmaking program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked to them at length recently
about whether some of what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to tap volunteerism toward the end
of conservation in their case,
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't be sort of mirrored or dovetailed
with the idea of developing some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: coaching program or volunteering program
around electrification and helping people
[SPEAKER_00]: access electrification resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I think there's more to be looked
at there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one area where we're seeing
connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Lake Oswego in LOSN, we are connecting
with state and national groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an electrification action
committee that we're connecting with
[SPEAKER_04]: Electrify Now and creating a coaching
electrification coaching group to help
[SPEAKER_04]: people electrify.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I'm pretty
unfamiliar with this extension kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: concept and how we might work better with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love the fact that it feels like
it's kind of embedded in communities all
[SPEAKER_03]: over the country, which is such an
important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everyone here has been touching
the speakers on this kind of local action
[SPEAKER_03]: idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way local action works is by
connecting well to what the communities
[SPEAKER_03]: like Sarah spoke to that very eloquently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, without people on the ground,
you can have the best programs in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world and they won't get any traction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to explore it more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to talk to you maybe and others
more about what that might look like,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm pretty unfamiliar with what
that extension program is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent you a chat with my email
address.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody else is welcome as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Colin has one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York State has some similar programs
called the Regional Clean Energy Hubs with
[SPEAKER_02]: a link.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have found that there is generally good
awareness for various energy and cost
[SPEAKER_02]: savings programs, but low participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been your program's best
practices for moving someone from
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness to action?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's more important, education and
outreach or program design and incentive
[SPEAKER_02]: structure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I've asked that question,
Colin, it tends to be in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like to have the contractors
there and the program leader people,
[SPEAKER_00]: design people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ideally, some just humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fit in that category of maybe the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just map it out, start to
finish the path from awareness to action
[SPEAKER_00]: and every little place on that path where
you could fall off or where something is
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we design the program to smooth
that and have an answer for every moment
[SPEAKER_00]: where it gets confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've run, I mentioned the Solarize and
Weatherize campaigns, but where I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: most success in getting uptake in an
actual program, it's when we like hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze the program in that respect and
pick a geography and pick some partners
[SPEAKER_00]: and run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some of those cases, we were
negotiating with the contractors to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweeten the deal a little bit and have an
extra incentive or some discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, we were simply just
promoting the program and helping people
[SPEAKER_00]: feel better about participating and giving
them a sense of now is the moment we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all doing it together in my community
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where partnering with the
energy committees and doing it a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: communities at a time was very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that skill made sense at the level
that we were operating in rural New
[SPEAKER_00]: Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just add on that the reason I know
Sarah is because she worked with my mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: town, which is Cornish, New Hampshire,
to have a competition with the neighboring
[SPEAKER_02]: town, which is Plainfield, New Hampshire,
to see who could weatherize more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there had little tickers, you know,
like who was winning, who was getting
[SPEAKER_02]: more, and then they did the same thing
with solarizing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who has more solar panels?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was as they got each
town had incentives because if the town
[SPEAKER_02]: got to 10 participants, the cost of the
weatherization or the solar panels went
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they got to 20 participants,
right, the cost of the solar panels for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody and for the weatherization went
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so not only did you get everybody to
sort of cajole everybody else in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also started getting everybody
talking about the issues and finessing the
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and actually making a better
product for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking towns of like 1,400
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about some huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one building in New York City has
1,400 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't get my building to like even
put a solar panel on our roof,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was so joyful and fun and silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And real, like, and I say silly with most
endearing means when I mean real,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was just so real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just put that out there because like
Brian said in the beginning, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can take an austerity politic as the
only way of getting through this,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we can just improve our air quality,
improve our water quality improve our,
[SPEAKER_02]: our efficiency and savings, all of these
things like, like, why are we resisting
[SPEAKER_02]: it, which is my question, ultimately for
all of us, but does anybody else want to
[SPEAKER_02]: give their perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally went off and I shouldn't have,
and we are over time, but I feel like this
[SPEAKER_02]: group is rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do, I would love to respond to
that, Jennifer, real quickly, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel, and someone asked this in one of the
Q and A's, you know, it's the,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of things in this space,
the upfront cost is often the thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: is the hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that can, that can take many
different forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the upfront cost might be scary
when you're comparing it to a lower cost,
[SPEAKER_03]: also fuel piece of equipment that's going
to cost you more over the life of the
[SPEAKER_03]: product, but the upfront cost is lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one impediment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another impediment is particularly if
you're talking to more of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: another version of that, particularly for
lower income folks, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, like the idea of a new water heater
is just like, so not in the cards because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're trying to keep food on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those upfront costs just become like
completely showstoppers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of feel like the incentives were
one take at this, the IRA, the whole idea
[SPEAKER_03]: that IRA was the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: The very least it would encourage people
to buy more efficient equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is going to be better in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the, best case scenarios,
these more efficient versions of heat
[SPEAKER_03]: pumps and other devices are competitive
with gas equipment or fairly close because
[SPEAKER_03]: of those upfront incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one way to get at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other way that I just still
scratch my head about like why this isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: more of a thing is financing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you think about nobody buys a
car with cash, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost everyone finances their cars when
they purchase them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's relatively easy to buy
these expensive devices because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: spreading the cost out over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just weird to me that there isn't
more like prevalent examples of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the number of people who actually
finance their HVAC equipment is teeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things cost almost as much as a
nominal bill and yet people have to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: cash for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, that's another frontier I would love
to try to crack the code on somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, you probably have more experience
with that, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Upfront costs, that's a big hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just underscore the, the weird aversion to
financing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing that for a decade and I
think until it can be as easy as on bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I've started to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I used to do some work in
Vermont and Green Mountain Power over
[SPEAKER_00]: there did a great job building some of
this into their rate structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when they really started to see
the adoption, but it was years of having
[SPEAKER_00]: great programs through the local banks,
just no uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I, could I just also mention as a
resource, there's a really dynamic group
[SPEAKER_01]: of family consumer science educators in
extension that pay attention to household
[SPEAKER_01]: finance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to solve the problem by
creating the new financial tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are a really good group to help
people understand what tools do exist that
[SPEAKER_01]: might, that might from the consumer side
make it easier for people to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of going this kind of route.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dave, did you put a link on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you say I'm looking for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it right here yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not put a link, but I will if,
if I can before Jenny shuts us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, I'm going to talk to you
anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a really great tag team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of ideation and, and doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody knows that you can
contact me with ideas of things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be presented next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we are trying very hard to get
multiple voices in order to cross
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilize and innovate as well as
implement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be sure to send me an email and you can
also join NECI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all a volunteer crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's many different ways to
participate, but more important than
[SPEAKER_02]: joining NECI is figuring out how to make
this happen in your own community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say, thank you so much
for our speakers today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have my heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope you all have a great rest of
your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recordings will be online within about
seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I hope to hear from you all soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
