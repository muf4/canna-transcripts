[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is my title.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk all this stuff first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this propaganda about some base
funding we have at Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to really congratulate a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think there's faculties,
my professors, but a lot of the students,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, graduate students, postos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell is a wonderful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I was completely transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did my master degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did plant breeding, PhD in quantitative
genetics, plant breeding, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: good enough, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the two years, my postal with Ed and
with Cornell that really transformed my
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an easy to say opportunity
because, you know, a lot of things going
[SPEAKER_00]: on here are the leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question cannot be answered here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you would expect the other place
to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a wonderful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we start be able to move up to
my career is because of Ed's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: postal training, big vision, thinking that
there are a lot of problems still need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be resolved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all being solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's small problem, technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's major large scale problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing I have to mention too
is it was, I think it was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seminar I gave at the postal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Launch seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was another professor
sitting in the audience, Mike Scanlon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were supposed to collaborate
as a postal with Ed and with Mike's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I get a presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I did okay, Mike, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike, later on, when I went to
K-State, Mike, you know, engaged me into
[SPEAKER_00]: his epi-commeristem NSF project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first grant got me tenured and
second grant get me professored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that says how much connection you can
build while you're in Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be two years,
three years, four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's research, but it's a network of
scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the transformation of the thinking
that really can help you later on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about some of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My talk typically geared towards graduate
students and postos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I talk, a little bit like a
teacher instructor style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgive me, the professors.
[SPEAKER_00]: My position is quantitative genetics in
maze breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I modify this position title to address
significant question in plant breeding by
[SPEAKER_00]: combining cutting-edge genomic technology
and a quantitative genetic theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of quantitative genetic theory
always give people statistical genomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, obey the various components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really relevant if you talk about
the, you know, cutting-edge genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I left this group, Ed insisted me
have to sequence some genes and run some
[SPEAKER_00]: jail, which I appreciate a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you are somebody who just
playing the data, you don't understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated, the gene structure of
developmental biology unless you do
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't have to touch papers
or do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really changed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, too, we have a long history of
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is George Sprague that started the
synthetic populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Russell developed the B73,
which is, you know, Steve Stockson said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Bill started the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill derived a lot of B73 and Anna Haller,
a lot of wonderful histories in Iowa State
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily in genetics, there's
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the tradition that you'll see
Eberhardt and Russell, Eberhardt and
[SPEAKER_00]: Russell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, you know, John English analysis
paper on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Kendo Lamke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, I just started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we believe that the power of
quantitative genetics, it is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional, you know, I think Ed write a
lot of breeding 4.0 and quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic genomics, some of the postal
writing, the review papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's still a very valid framework
to combine what we learn from genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: this biotech, genomics, and testics into
plant breeding is provide the engine,
[SPEAKER_00]: the framework to push everything forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research and training of grad students
really have four areas, complex trait
[SPEAKER_00]: dissection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do GWAS, try to clone some genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily easy, you know,
gene cloning product is really in-depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some gene we cloned and
then genetics, some breeding strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the side, we do study some
genomes and the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the study, this is in
collaboration with Mike Scanlon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this actually gave me something
to talk with Woltec, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about recombination,
methylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't go into details, but it's all
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about this thing from the
chromosomes and then the genes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes, DNA structure to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always switch to the species we
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is actually, sometimes we have
this framework to understand we do not
[SPEAKER_00]: want a student to only stay in one
breeding or one kinetics, one
[SPEAKER_00]: bioinformatics area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have a taste of all different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The book I like to share is this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this book, maybe some of the
professors read this book in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the Triple Helix written by
Dick Leventing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually really helped us from the
way we, you know, start of doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: project until we published this paper last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really carry this book with me
on my flight to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote people, especially you are not
in developmental biology, to read this
[SPEAKER_00]: book, Triple Helix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title is, you know, really try to
understand the genes, organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of historical debate
about this, you know, nature, nurture,
[SPEAKER_00]: IQ, gene control, environment,
social science, and the natural science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a wonderful book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not actually, after reading this book
25 times, I do not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 times for sure, I do not necessarily
agree with whatever this book says.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the insights we gain really
help us understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the modern summary from the genome
to the environment, to the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the genotype by environment
action, there's also something called
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental noise that gives you this
final organism, or you can call that
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype on this label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time, if you look at the
historical textbooks of plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we profile the environment effect out
before we study genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about the intramine-based
heritability calculation, we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have the environmental variance,
classifiable environmental variance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: denominator because we calculate
intramine-based ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through this, reading this book,
it connected me with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: better appreciation of developmental
biology with the environment, what has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little joke that we say after
study genetics, most of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people in the room,
we talk about genetics, gotta be genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other people think about the
management, environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, well, the genetics, we can study
this easily because if we have maize has
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 chromosomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have three sets of seven,
21 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice have 12, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this genetic material is
organized on the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we call this chromosomes of the
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a, you know, central meter
and a telomere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that there was a joke from start by
Jody Edwards, but really help us
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's classify everything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the first chromosome of the,
it's a radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think of a radiation, let's just
think of temperature easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation is a day lens, day lens
cycle first.
[SPEAKER_00]: A temperature, the rainfall, these are
three major things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the soil type, crop type
management, but the whole framework is an
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, is the crop modeling framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole crop modeling, sometimes it's
difficult to understand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my lab members actually took the
workshop crop model episode, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still hard to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least we agree that it's the day
lens and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, you know, top two reasons that
affect the plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different from animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the plant specific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another classic textbook examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have taken any class
that showing this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the EIRO.
[SPEAKER_00]: This EIRO, this was done a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture is supposed to show three
terms, reactant norm, phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: plasticity, and genotype by environment
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: On each X axis here, there's seven
different cuttings, clones, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: planted in low elevation, medium
elevation, and high elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the flowering, they all flowered
at a low elevation, and the plant height
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered in descending order.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see that this picture was supposed
to show that there's so much shibai,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that there's no clear pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not be able to predict the
performance of a plant just because
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the same plant here, it's even got
stunted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even not flowered, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here, it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go to the high elevation,
they change again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing this three term,
reactant norm, phenotypic plasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a numerical representation,
they would show these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the low elevation, medium
elevation, seven segmental lines going up
[SPEAKER_00]: and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was supposed to used by this big
clementin to show that it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: track.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was actually hidden pattern
behind this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you photoshop resulting, we will skip
that, but this is just to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this experiment was done in 1948
for younger scientists or grad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, in 1948, when it's published,
it says, experimental study on the nature
[SPEAKER_00]: of the species, environmental responses of
the climate, races of Achillea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was done a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This elevation is back in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in timber line, and it's this high
elevation, manther, medium elevation,
[SPEAKER_00]: low, a stem fold is low elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at this paper title called
evolution in changing environments,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment is changing a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is a classic book to show
this three important terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this, another picture was used in
the textbook, but it typically this was
[SPEAKER_00]: taken from one of the early study of Bill
Russell, Wilbert Russell from Iowa State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just to show that as a two maize
varieties, this variety one has a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This variety two has a slower response,
but in general, it has less plasticity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most stability farmers would prefer
variety two over the variety one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety one was a older variety unless
it's under the very favorable condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: other than most of time, farmer will
prefer this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also in the plant breeding
genetics, there's a Everhart Russell
[SPEAKER_00]: model, stability parameters, joint
regression analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, there's other models published in
Ophelia, but that this picture shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we actually study this G by
E, we actually, look at some of the paper
[SPEAKER_00]: written by a historian.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the historian wrote a paper called
the R.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher, the origins of genotype by
environment interaction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this paper, he cited that R.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher and his nonlinear interaction of
heritage and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher at that early years, his main goal
is to partition the variation into
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leftover goes to the G by E or arrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He studied mainly the human height
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are studies where he can partition
iris and perfectly in genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: environment almost negligible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher also liked to do transformation of
the data so that the G by E interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: will be minimized, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Lancelot Hogeben, he's in their
dependency in nature and nurture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a developmental biologist,
but he's also a statistician, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be strong statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually communicated with Fisher about
this nature nurture debate, genotype by
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the classical debate,
so actually, so this too, because we trace
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the biometric concept of G by E to
Fisher, partition, and we trace back the
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental concept of G by E,
this D, developmental, to Lancelot
[SPEAKER_00]: Hogeben, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show you that actually, when I give
talks that has animal scientists sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: in the audience, I was very proud that
Fisher actually is also a plant biologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Fisher, the Fisher 1918 is
regarding the funding paper in
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still providing the guidance to human
genetics these days, after this
[SPEAKER_00]: post-genetic era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this paper published in 1923 is
relatively easier paper, so that if I say
[SPEAKER_00]: easy, I say, well, now we could
understand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher 1918, talking with Jean-Luc,
I still couldn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you people sitting in the
audience, I trust Connell, must understand
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher 1918.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be very proud of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then please help your other colleagues
understand Fisher 1918.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started 10 times, I never finished,
because you can only understand the first
[SPEAKER_00]: three pages, then you're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Fisher 1923, Fisher 1923 contained
the first NOAA table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first NOAA table ever been
published, table three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fisher was doing experiment with 12
potato varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any potato breeders or
scientists sitting in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a 60 from the manure treatment
for the 12 and 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then any deviation from summation
formula, this will be the 5 times 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the interaction degree freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because Fisher has the
replications, you can have the random
[SPEAKER_00]: error, residual error with this degree
freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sum of squares means squares and
deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first partition,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fisher did a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that Fisher did this
study, well, was he expecting to find a G
[SPEAKER_00]: by E in manure treatment response,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But he actually lay out his reasoning,
because if you want to do a G by E with
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, with temperature, it's difficult
to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually did this manureing experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did not find any, because look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that time, we don't have F test.
[SPEAKER_00]: F test was invented by Snedeker,
but given the credit to Fisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: F.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the standard deviation of this
mean square of 4.22.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not much different from 3.53.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interaction was not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually influenced a lot of animal
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the animal breeding typically lush.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this school of breeders, we say we're
going to focus on breeding values.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to focus on genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ignore that environment
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore that G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually why we made so much
progress in plant breeding and animal
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we didn't understand the
environmental effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a famous picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This experiment was done by somebody else,
but this picture was used in the letters
[SPEAKER_00]: between the Fisher and Hogeben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to understand this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Drosophila mutans,
low bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ultra bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this under 16 degree and then 25
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hogeben was focused on the individual
development, not the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the 16 potato right at the hole or
6-manurin treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said, look, if you say,
where is the environment effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look under the context of the ultra
bar, this is my environment effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 16 to 25, I get this difference,
this segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under this low bar, my environmental
effect is this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is my genotype effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: My genotype effect under 16 degree is this
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my genotype effect under 25 degree is
shrink to this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just asked this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Fisher and Lancelot, they have
different focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could not agree on certain things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the historian Samurai, this biometric
and developmental origin of G by E says
[SPEAKER_00]: that in that time, the biometric tradition
is to partition the variation populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Courses of variation, it's not developed
on genes, courses of variation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how much variation can be partitioned
in a statistical approach and biometric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the developmental biologists,
we focus on individual, they focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: individual development, causal mechanisms,
specific genes, and how everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then interventionists, they are
generative mutans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this developmental part of G by
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tradition is still being followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, we understand this whole
thing is functional, depending whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do details or you want to describe
the population as a whole, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our study is typically not large scale,
but it contains enough essential element
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to couple these two concepts
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually, as I said, I was at Kansas
State Amaze geneticist for six and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were growing the sorghum,
TX430 in the P. You remember T and P. This
[SPEAKER_00]: picture taken the same day, this flower,
T flowered earlier than P, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to nursery, try to get
more plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people have experience in
mental nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here, P, earlier than T.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked to plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, oh, that's easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: T is early here, P is early here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing new, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, why does that happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to ask why, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you calculate this just crossover
interactions, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I had a position change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa is further north of Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting to see the T first,
the P second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in one of the Iowa, and then this is
14, P is earlier than T.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they switched again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually serendipity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes if I think I move a
different place, I might not see this
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not have the discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could plant summer in Kansas
or Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could plant winter nursery,
but you could not plant the winter in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas or Iowa, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we talked to the crop modelers,
the physiologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked us to say, what if you plant
the same population?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a real population.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Puerto Rico, we thought they're going
to happen the T first, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened in Puerto Rico,
T first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just keep changing the two
parents, keep changing the orders of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just, a lot of,
if you're breeding or applied research
[SPEAKER_00]: focus, you know that was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ask why.
[SPEAKER_00]: We happen to do some genetics and ask why
that's happened, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know there's a lot of people doing
the gene regulatory pathways, networks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple pathways, autonomous
pathway, gibberellum pathway, this
[SPEAKER_00]: photo-period pathway, mainly of the
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's FT.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to synthesize flow region to
obtain this vegetative to flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us to grow the topical material,
we typically cover it in the trash cans or
[SPEAKER_00]: the black forms to induce a flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's early stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that some of the photo-period
synthin happens in the early stage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, let's actually show this whole
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like, let's try to discover
patterns underlying the apparently complex
[SPEAKER_00]: G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the reactinorm plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Joe Gage is an expert in
reactinorm and he published a good paper
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Puerto Rico 1112.
[SPEAKER_00]: This T is a blue and the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the highlighted dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is 250 reels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not complicated design anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just mapping population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You track the flowering time change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, T is early and T here, P is late.
[SPEAKER_00]: This T is early and then change again,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional analysis, you can sort
this by instead, this was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: arranged by the photo-period, they learned
from Puerto Rico to Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the data, you're older by
your data, categorically, you say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, in these three sites, that blue,
which is T, is later than P. And then
[SPEAKER_00]: things changed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The photo-period temperature changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, if then you numerically,
taking the average we call environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, it's average of the population
flowering time transformed into X-axis,
[SPEAKER_00]: this now became a joint regression
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the X, Y-axis using the same data,
it's just the X-axis using the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental mean and then the Y-axis
depict all individual lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everything looks nice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just saying that if the whole
population flowered early and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: here, if the whole population flower late,
they're here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going live.
[SPEAKER_00]: This figure is actually nothing new
because in genetics, in plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joint genomic, joint regression analysis,
there's nothing new here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is new with that in this general
context of predictive phenomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to understand, okay, I talk about
multiple chromosomes of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a genotype somehow squeezed
into a one-dimensional space, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze this environmental as the
fertility or richness or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: How?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just squeeze into the environment
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now our performance is actually on the
Z-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually have a landscape,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the X, Y, and the Z going up and
going down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say, well, if we actually can sample
this whole landscape by sample certain
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, its performance under certain
environment, we actually give the data
[SPEAKER_00]: points actually to map all this up and
down, and then we can predict what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plant breeding, we also have a term
called a target population of genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: target population of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This term, just say we're mapping within
something is tractable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot throw up new terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to be, this whole thing
will be distorted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the general idea about when we have the
data, we realized after many years of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing most of time in scientific studies,
what we do is a pattern discovery,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just discover patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want your paper published,
you look at figure one, figure two,
[SPEAKER_00]: figure three, it just accumulates your
lead to support your final conclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: because you see patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not random, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A statistic test is against randomness,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your pattern finding is a whole
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, in this whole area,
we try to, a plant breeding, we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: tested environment, tested the genotypes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, we do not want to study
GVAE because we're not like companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough funding to have
multiple sites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, within our sites, we want to be
homogeneous, and then we can just get some
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are in charge for breeding for
large geographical regions, you do have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with GVAE, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then this is the untested
genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The key thing is, for our research,
is to connect the tested environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: the untested environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This untested environment can exist in the
future, let's say, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't planted it yet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have problems getting it into the
field, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this connect the tested genotype,
untested genotype, this is relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have experts sitting the, you know,
you can actually, you know, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the papers, you know, as group
published, you can connect a tested
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype to the ancient, the maze,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, can predict its performance,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This side is relatively straightforward of
genomic selection, but it's testing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the untested environment,
you can connect with the court models,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of earlier papers from
Hasselhoff, with Mark Soros' group is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very influential paper published to say
how you connect the environment together,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really want is a future genotype,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Future inbred cultivars or the future
hybrids and their future environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have to establish all these
connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our research, actually, is really,
this diagram was first time showed by I
[SPEAKER_00]: think Fred Van Eewink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just learned how to do this thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal is to connect the environment,
tested and untested, so we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: forecasting, we can do predicting in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at a day lens, Iowa, Kansas,
Puerto Rico, and we look at temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that if you plant in the
summer of Puerto Rico, it's a long day
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Puerto Rico is a long day environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a short day, but you look
at the day hours, it's 14 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, 14, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, we use 12 and a half or 13
hours and long day, short day separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for sorghum, also true for
rice, I think, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then temperature, we couldn't see any
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We clustered the temperature, there's
something going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use performance of reels to the
two-way clusters, we feel the Kansas
[SPEAKER_00]: together, Puerto Rico, Iowa, and then
Puerto Rico 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Iowa 14 summer planting is clustered
together with Puerto Rico 11, Puerto Rico
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Iowa 13 was clustered with a Puerto
Rico 14S.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all different patterns we can
figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost ignore this slide because
we're going to show you what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened is that we studied the
temperature like day lengths alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day lengths, this is a 3D correlation
plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day lengths here, day lengths also
here, and it is this average environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: mean of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're talking about the whole
population try to correlate that
[SPEAKER_00]: performance with the day lengths and then
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlation is not very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature profile is not high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do something called the
photosomal time, GDD times day lengths,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have this beautiful shade pattern
of correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these dots going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, low temperature is mimicking
a short day environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature and then the day lengths as a
compensation between them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually is also not new because that
in the modeling, we know this PTT
[SPEAKER_00]: photosomal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thermal time, green degree days,
or day lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But making them together, but the key
thing is next slide, we search a window to
[SPEAKER_00]: find this critical window where PTT can
predict the population mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, here is actually summarized
everything we try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that in an early group stage,
so that's why we all like to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: biologists these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tell us what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's temperature same thing,
day length same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the determination of the transition
from vegetative to the reproductive stage
[SPEAKER_00]: was determined here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we basically, I'll show you this
search process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is a 2D scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning of the search window,
end of the search window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we basically try to calculate a
large number of correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlation, here we call population
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about environment mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a population flowered early or late.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, if I tell you that Puerto Rico 11,
12, they're flowered early, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: chances are flower late, so that's the
dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the photosomal time, basically we try
to find if I start at different stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: where do I find the most correlated window
that can give me the predicted flower time
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, we'll show an animation to
see how the search going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, if now, remember earlier,
I have a figure, I said this is nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: new because it is really nice and new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a typical, if you have the
population grew out, you already done the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an environmental mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if I didn't do the experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is to replace this environmental
mean with an environmental parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the struggle we went through
trying to replace this parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you replace this x-axis,
now it's called the photosomal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's photosomal time during a specific
group stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that photosomal time,
I can predict the flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change the x-axis to make it predictive
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how we call this critical
environmental regressor through informed
[SPEAKER_00]: search.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the earlier papers and also the
modeling papers, they just have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They function.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just don't understand what is
being calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they give a lot of insights to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to take out the evidence of the
model saying, among all these parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the most sensitive parameters?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's photosomal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically have seven numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seven numbers is the x-axis,
this value, projected x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got seven environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the means.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change the search window of the green
of the photosomal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see which one gives you high
correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can define a three-day window.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can define a seven-day window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we have a window, if you know
how to program, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start and end.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start animation, this horizontal
position is not going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This position is going to not change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's changing this x-axis window.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically try to build lots of
correlation to find where the best
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation can replace the environmental
mean so that in the future, before I do
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiment, I know I can predict
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out it's 18 to 43 days that
calculated the photosomal time can be
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.996.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially one.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me, how about the rainfall?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about others?
[SPEAKER_00]: People say correlation, causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a correlation 0.996,
you don't care about the correlation,
[SPEAKER_00]: causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else could you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things to ask why that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have backup of the theological
research or developmental biology
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have that done, now we can
actually do a joint genomic regression
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis through the reaction norm
parameter estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, because now you have this
x-axis, now if you derive this x-axis from
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiment, it became
performance-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you stay in the typical
environment, you can do forecasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each genotype, its performance along the
x-axis became captured by the intercept.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do an intercept here and a slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything just intercepts a slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you predict the tested genotype
under testing environment to predict an
[SPEAKER_00]: untested environment, that's easy because
you can read off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can predict under the tested
environment, you can have some genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some genotype will have this performance
intercept slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other genotypes, you use GBLAP,
predict intercept, predict a slope,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you just read off your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hide your data to do tested
genotype under tested environment to the
[SPEAKER_00]: untested genotype untested environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key here, people ask why this
correlation 0.95, 0.87, 0.88, 0.86 so
[SPEAKER_00]: high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this reaction norm does not only
contain GBAE, but it also contains the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype effect, but also contains the
location effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in this location always flower
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relation generates flower early.
[SPEAKER_00]: This high correlation, we predicted it,
contains both location prediction,
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental prediction, plus the
specific prediction for each genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if you read this picture,
it says the observed GBAE is a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: process of the plasticity containing each
genotype plus the environment input.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, before we sold everything out,
it was up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: After you sold it, you can do predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time to understand this,
but let's see another companion thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do a genomic regression
analysis with a genome-wide marker effect
[SPEAKER_00]: continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to say that in genomic prediction,
genomic selection, we have two terms,
[SPEAKER_00]: one called GBLAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That individual's performance was
predicted through GBLAP through the mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: model additive relationship matrix,
but you can also assign this breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: value to each marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each marker can give an RBLAP to have the
marker breathing values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'll show you that this is through
the marker effect continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, earlier flies, each line is a
genotype, is an individual, is an
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, each line is a marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the marker has its effect changing
down or up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the input of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we change the numerical,
but if we add it here, that's where we
[SPEAKER_00]: derive this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, these two values are almost one,
essentially highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do prediction from the marker
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give me an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just summarize the marker effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do the predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This equivalency between the GBLAP and
RBLAP was realized by the reaction norm
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have more slides to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in most of our genomic selection
paper, I think we do a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean-Luc can do a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always sometimes ask empirical
validation, but the data is empirical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people always ask, what about you do
additional experiments?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that earlier analysis,
we have the Puerto Rico IVA 14 and an IVA
[SPEAKER_00]: 13, Puerto Rico 14 summer plant in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we planted IVA 15 and 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our model stopped before IVA 15 and 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're going to predict what has
happened in IVA 15, IVA 16, and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The IVA is really nice because the IVA 14
is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: IVA 16 is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spans this crossover region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the temperature and their lens
has interaction itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental factors have interactions,
and they interact with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you this G by E interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this empirical validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlation coefficient is 0.8,
and it is 0.88.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're a little bit off our target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because the window we selected is
somewhat fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could, in the future, select a
dynamic window, we believe that we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: a better target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the empirical experiment we ran in
two years to prove whatever we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture also facilitates you to think
about the breeding companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know the historical average of each
site, you can optimize your sites to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate environmental that optimized
Howard X-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the testing in these
locations forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some location might give you redundant
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can optimize the testing sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't specify this in the paper,
but it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we say a lot of research we do to
explain or to predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, in the nature explained,
we can do to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means we do genetic study or
developmental studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generate the mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do gene cloning, magnet studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we do GWAS, select significant
peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, we do the black box
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think about the machine learning
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, there's a human nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even sometimes, we can predict.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still ask, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we can predict?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you publish a paper saying
explanatory machine learning, people like
[SPEAKER_00]: it, because they can connect with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these two actually should be joined
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same slide about the
regulation networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same set of data, we can do basic QTO
mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do QTO mapping, you'll see this
five genes give you the peaks at different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can do multi-environmental
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get this one, single environment
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the epistasis is also significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is here, although
prediction is based on genome markers,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's major genes that generating this
effect allow us to be predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see this slide again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because two parents have genome sequence,
we can actually relate these QTO peaks to
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific gene that other groups have
cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the different alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the geopics to show that when we
say claim is the gene underlying its
[SPEAKER_00]: peaks, we have some competence to say
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you can do genetic mapping of
reaction norm parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in other groups too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this reaction norm now is the reaction
norm generated from an environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an environmental mean anymore,
because we believe that when you use this
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction norm generated from environment
index, any gene you showed up should be
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene that directly responsive to this
environmental parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find this same thing, same peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interaction is also significant for
the intercept, for the slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The performance across the geographic
diverse environment is a phenotype too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just see a transformation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we read the earlier paper by Thomas
Younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: His group did an investigative summary to
say that sometimes you can have gene
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of a technistic hypertrophy or
conditional neutral or differential
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitivity or no G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means QTO can be up here,
down here, detected and undetected,
[SPEAKER_00]: both detected by different effect or
non-detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we actually follow the same logic,
we can actually say this other seven
[SPEAKER_00]: locations, you can see this QTO is about
ME1 in certain locations as a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: effect versus the other reference allele,
sometime has a positive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because we think that differential
sensitivity, conditional neutral or
[SPEAKER_00]: testing hypertrophy, this all is just
depending which segment or which gene
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because plant are mathematicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to learn all this time
integration or time averaging or the rate
[SPEAKER_00]: detection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to do differential
equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the categorical seven locations,
but if you plot this photosomal time,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we are showing this genetic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a constant across environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic effect is changing the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the big A, big A, big A,
big A, small A, small A?
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes the size and directions along
this environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a genomic marker effect also
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not plants, they try to have
different environmental input.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to flower, but make a decision to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change their effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we say unifying developmental and
biometric aspect of G by E is enabled by
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic analysis because we think that
developmental G by E or developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was happening here,
but if you just analyze in the final
[SPEAKER_00]: results, that's the biometric G by
partition, the variance, components,
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate heritability, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what happened here is individual,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's got united.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a lot of statements saying that
integrated analysis of genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: environment can reveal the magnetic scene
to play under the observed phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this So this is mostly for the
breeding company, large companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could actually sometime optimize your
testing sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also think about how to use the
winter nursery observations because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you figure out the G by E, you can
leverage some information from the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear, we say this prediction is site
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whole genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This IS is in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually, if you can really
think about how you design and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about data mining, you have the data,
you mine the data, you see the pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how you do this pattern direct
your future experiment, how you decide
[SPEAKER_00]: which genotype to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pick the most representative
genotypes for the whole landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to pick the environment based on
historical 15-year average, the testing on
[SPEAKER_00]: your genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this paper published.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really happy about this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper contains tons of stuff we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real mapping population,
but we were able to get this published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work for other traits,
other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far I'm working for farm time,
plant higher air height, grain yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work all this stuff on all the crops we
have data to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the rice study we did
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that it's not photosomal
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a temperature profile actually give
you this negative .99 predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is ongoing research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then does this work for other traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really got asked many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's physics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have these first two chromosomes
is the radiation is thinking about day
[SPEAKER_00]: length and the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, earth's been rotating, world's been
revolutioning around the sun and rotating
[SPEAKER_00]: by itself is a tilted axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us the seasonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why whatever people like crop modeling,
why it would not work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all the plants show up in the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to adapt to the seasonal changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature changes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just say, well,
finally we think that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological observations have to agree with
the physics, law of physics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did something about optimized
design of genomic section of the hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there earlier we showed the
testing environment can be optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the testing individuals can be
optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll skip that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, we say instead of the to
explain, to predict, we believe that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do to explain and to predict,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So under our narrow context, we say you
can establish a unified framework for
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic prediction under untested
genotype, untested environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think more, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about a 3D structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could say there is a unified synthesis
framework, at least synthesis framework
[SPEAKER_00]: that can combine genomic selection,
GWAS, and G by E all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to say GS, GWAS under G by
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to say GS, GWAS, and G by E,
because remember that 3D picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and genotype and performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of time when we do GS or GWAS,
either we slice through this 3D to do our
[SPEAKER_00]: GWAS or GS, or we squeeze or summarize
this 3D to a 2D, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These three things actually can be all
think about together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, you know, we work on,
I learned genomics, I learned quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, and learned developmental
biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to talk to everybody,
so because we can actually help us to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain and to predict, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got funded by different agencies,
and then Xianran Li and Tingting Guoxing
[SPEAKER_00]: Li, major contributors of this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Mike Scanlon,
who also funded SAM project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was wondering, what was your power
and resolution to detect QTL when you just
[SPEAKER_04]: went by different environments rather than
using photothermal time?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to do that, to discover what
the genes were, did it help to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: photothermal time or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Resolution in power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question, because after the
study published, we keep thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys gonna be thinking too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said the minimum environment to study
G by E is 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have an intercept and a slope,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, what about individual two
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you study G by E?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fit your two environment under the
context of reaction norm, the answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the average and difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as good as you have three dots to
have regression line, but it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: approximation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then go back to single environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you study G by E with single
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people know, because you have to have
two environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, any major QTL peaks you
detected in a single environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow pointing to these plasticity
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the single environment is sitting on
the x-axis of the environmental index
[SPEAKER_00]: change, your question is great,
because in single environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: besides the major environment index
changing your flaring time, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: local specific environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say there's a drive spell,
or let's say there's some extra nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: change your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your detection power will be low,
because every phenotype is shifted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole pathway, the network, this
perceptron goes to that signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you feed that signal into the
general framework of the range of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, yeah, it should be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I answered the question,
but for us to do this research,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did do this individual and together to
help us to see why some signal
[SPEAKER_00]: persistently showing up in different
environment, because that's capturing the
[SPEAKER_00]: main drivers of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other signals will disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because other things twisted it along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, for photo thermal time,
your day length and heat, they're huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they control a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, they're useful for prediction,
I guess, because if you know where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to grow something, you make a pretty
good guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just kind of curious how your
other environmental chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will, things like precipitation,
affect your predictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do they improve it if you know them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they just totally pretty much
worthless in this framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to get the data to give us,
let's say, with a relatively fixed photo
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal time of day length and
temperature, and then different rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is that the pattern
discovery, predictive power, only if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have detectable patterns in the data could
you then be able to detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, for the photo thermal time and
also for plant height, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment we ran, typically we irrigate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or typically, unless they became an
outlier of the whole other experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take them out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So otherwise, we haven't to be able to use
the rainfall pattern to improve this
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is possible, especially for large
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ran a lot of, you know, gated the
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have large data, you could
improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it says that because the environment is
continuous, but the developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology, at a certain time,
it's become critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can capture what is happening
there, and then you can have some
[SPEAKER_00]: predictive power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, you know, I'm happy to
acknowledge that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said plants are mathematicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: For flowering time, clearly they have to
be good mathematicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't flower at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: For yields, it seems like mathematics
breaks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many, many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, what if fertilizer comes
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what if rain comes later?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the fundamental process is you
take your environmental parameters and you
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out some kind of combination of
them that gives you your correlation of
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.99 or better, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you use that for slope and
intercept.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, given the number of things
that affect yield, there's a multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: testing problem in terms of, you know,
I mean, because you have water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have, I mean, you showed,
sorry, I'm going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shut me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You showed, like, you have one interval,
either one to four, one to seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: one to ten, two to seven, you know,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have one interval.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, why just one interval?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's three different critical
intervals that determine flowering time,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'm sure I could take just your
two numbers of temperature and photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period and get a higher R squared than
0.996, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you could get to one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you start thinking about,
you know, all of the other aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility and moisture and solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and they're spread out
across week number one, week number three,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, now week number one, day number one,
day number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there's a multiple testing
burden where no matter what, even if I had
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 environments, I could get to an R
squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember that crop model will handle
everything you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then here we're just saying that among
this large geography region, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: most essential components?
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow you to have the general predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do want to go to that finer scales,
yeah, you do the crop model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, instead of one axis, you take that
one period, you have multiple period,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all information, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever crop model, they take
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with the crop model is
that we, as geneticists of plant breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: we couldn't understand what is being the
critical, essential stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some, because the weather pattern
is continuous, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The day lengths won't change like this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature might change, but the
average temperature, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to just show, actually,
the reason why we could the statement you
[SPEAKER_00]: made about what if we find a multiple
windows?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great, because that's what our
study showed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as we can find the windows,
one index, two index, combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: index, machine learning can find the some
things, get the better prediction,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the purpose of this paper,
to say we can make predictions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern existing in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the data, and then we can do the
major ones first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, you know, there's a paper
published in Nature Genetics just last
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a crop model, it's a friend of an
e-vehicle of Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have better predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you cannot tell what was being
predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll end there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
And we'll thank Jimmy again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.

University.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
