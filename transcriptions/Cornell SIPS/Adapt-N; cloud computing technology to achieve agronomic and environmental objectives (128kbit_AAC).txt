[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a story about nitrogen
management on maize, corn, and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: research, development of a tool,
extension of that tool, and then recently
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercialization of that tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of background about
nitrogen, especially on corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of two components of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the production, the agronomic
aspect, and then the environmental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers spend a lot of money on
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they spend more on nitrogen than
they do on seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: NU sufficiently remains quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that nitrogen gets lost,
doesn't end up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of uncertainty associated
with nitrogen management, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing weather variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have all these what we call
negative externalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high energy input because of the
Haber-Bosch process to manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse gas emissions, very
considerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you some data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then persistent water quality
problems, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been throwing a lot of money at
that for years without really any
[SPEAKER_00]: progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about the hypoxia problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this dead zone basically in the
Gulf of Mexico that develops in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: summer every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the EPA has goals to get that down to
about 2,000 square miles but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: persistently averaging about 5,000 even
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not really making any progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where most of it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, corn production areas,
especially on poorly drained soils that
[SPEAKER_00]: have tile drainage, that causes a
hydrologic shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the EPA has through the Gulf
Hypoxia Action Plan and goal to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: those losses by 45%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you get 100% of the farm farmers
to really manage the nitrogen very
[SPEAKER_00]: carefully, it will be very difficult to
reach 45%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never going to be able to get 100%
of the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EPA is pushing it onto the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they each have their own goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should mention, of course,
that the Chesapeake Bay, very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not an easy problem to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we have the greenhouse gas
emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrous oxide is the largest
contribution from agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of global warming, 44% methane is
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon dioxide is third.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methane is probably a little higher now
that they increased the GHG component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a little interesting factoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, nitrogen application on
agricultural land has as much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas impact as the US aviation
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the planes that are flying around
have a similar impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a considerable problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're managing it very inefficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is really if we can really
match the nitrogen that the plant needs
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't over-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just provide exactly the amount
that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a critical plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the optimum nitrogen rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is some data from Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn after corn, corn after soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your optimum end rate may range from
100 to 250, actually probably 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say, well, most likely you're
going to be needing this or this amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have this huge range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not random.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are underlying factors of this
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil types, especially weather,
rotations, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ADAPTEN does, it aims to manage
this variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can tell you in this year on
this field, you maybe need only about this
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in another year, you maybe need about
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just improved dynamic recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really goes back into the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people collaborated on this,
even people like Jeff Wagonet and John
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson, for those of you who have been
around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to take advantage of a
lot of that investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1998 was really the idea that we analyzed
a lot of field trials and used our model
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically replicate the results of the
field trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to then say, well,
we can turn that around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use the model to make better
predictions of the seasonal nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since most of that variability is the
result of early season weather patterns,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you can still have an opportunity to
intervene, so maybe when the corn is about
[SPEAKER_00]: this high, you have an opportunity to
really improve the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we got some funding, computational
ag initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then about 10 years, we started to send
out email recommendations through the
[SPEAKER_00]: extension system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 2008, we developed what's then
called the ADAPT-N tool and was more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less a cloud-based tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011, we started to do extensive field
trials, basically in many places,
[SPEAKER_00]: many states, especially New York and Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this past year, we licensed the
product, and it's now been commercialized
[SPEAKER_00]: for a startup company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That company, by the end of the year,
will have nine employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you've been living in a cave for
the past few years, you know that cloud
[SPEAKER_00]: computing is changing the way we live,
the way we shop, the way we communicate,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we bank, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our clientele, farmers, consultants,
people like that, are very mobile people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sit in an office very much,
so they are very much going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from cloud-based mobile
technology, and that's what we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you bring in the opportunity
to do adaptive, real-time, localized
[SPEAKER_00]: services that we all, in a way,
use when we use all these great apps and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that, then we can really, hopefully,
make some progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have ADAPT-N.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be ADAPT-N.cals.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God, now we have ADAPT-N.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You now have to pay to get an account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has allowed us to really bring
this up to a much higher level in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sophistication, and it's growing and
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the great things about Cornell,
if you get involved with licensing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have some equity in a company,
and they fund some of your research,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to put up a slide like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to disclose that you have some
kind of a relationship with that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm doing to you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case somebody from the committee
on conflict of interest is in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does ADAPT-N do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not gonna go into any of the
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically takes information on weather,
soil, crop, and some economic factors to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate a nitrogen rate recommendation
for a particular field at a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here what all those
factors are, and I'll show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: screenshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: One key component is weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're using the high-resolution
weather information that's generated at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast Climate Center on the 11th
floor of Rockfield Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been a very critical partner in
all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high-resolution part of it is very
critical because you can see this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-day precipitation graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, for example, that this
part, southeastern Iowa received about six
[SPEAKER_00]: to eight inches of precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you go only maybe about 10,
15 kilometers to the north or the east,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they only got maybe like one or two
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's highly variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have good high-resolution
weather information, you're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to make a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we've seen that these very
heavy precipitation events defined as
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than two inches have increased
over the past 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we're seeing more of these
heavy precipitation events, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast and certainly also in the
Corn Belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is 1958.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the year of my birth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correlation does not equate causation,
remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't do this, although I probably
did contribute to it like all of you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, just a couple of screenshots to give
you a little bit of a sense of the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find your field on a map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can drop your shapefile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that means anything to you,
it's a GIS-based file system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the field identified,
and then you basically populate that with
[SPEAKER_00]: some information about the soil and the
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, here you indicate what soil
type it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be by name like a honey or a silt
loam, or it can just be by the textural
[SPEAKER_00]: class like a silty clay loam or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that links it to very extensive
soil databases that we have as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tool, indicate whether it's artificially
drained and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You provide information on the tillage
methodology, how much residue is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, how much organic matter is in the
soil, because that's actually a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop information, whether it's sweet or
grain or silage corn, what the maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: class is, what the date of planting,
the population, the rotational effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what's the previous crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it sod, is it soybean, is it wheat,
or things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some other information,
percent legume and all that, if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice also the pane here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say manage multiple zones or
multiple fields the same way, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: click on this, and then the same
information applies to multiple fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of things are really very
important to the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: As researchers we're like, eh,
whatever, but it's very important to the
[SPEAKER_00]: user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then of course how much nitrogen you
have already applied, so maybe a pre-plant
[SPEAKER_00]: application or a starter application,
in the Midwest maybe even a fall
[SPEAKER_00]: application, and then how much when,
what's the formulation, is it anhydrous
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia, is it urea, is it UAN,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much manure has been applied and what
the content of nitrogen and all that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the manure is, of course we're a dairy
state, very important feature of this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular tool, and irrigation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so just to give you a little
bit of a sense, a little bit of flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you would run the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently it's all at a large data center,
actually one in Virginia and one in Idaho
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, these famous kind of
big data centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you use, very inexpensive by
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you get a recommendation for this
particular field is 140 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives you a level of confidence you might
say, and then gives you a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: background information on how much
nitrogen is currently in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much is still needed, how much has
been lost so far through rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: especially or maybe ammonia
volatilization, how much water is
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in the soil, how much
precipitation have we received,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's even an irrigation advisory that
will be part of that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can enter different dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's October what, 16th?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna be applying nitrogen on
corn today, but you would be maybe on June
[SPEAKER_00]: 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can enter June 16th or any
other date and you can then generate a
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for that particular date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go back and at the end of the
season do what if scenarios, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some functionality that makes it
attractive to a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you know, it rolls up the
nitrogen recommendation for each field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this farmer would have to purchase this
much nitrogen total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some of the functionality
that helps them manage their fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives them max and them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it basically allows you to look
at each field individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just click on this, then the whole
individual field comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just nice functionalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you may be an agronomist or a crop
consultant who is working with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have their summaries, you know,
so these are multiple, for a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant this is actually, this may be
100 or so or even 500 fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so try to make it attractive for
them to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the daily alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of you doing the simulation,
we do it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the new weather information comes
in, it gets run and then you get an email
[SPEAKER_00]: or text message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically get a daily update on the
nitrogen status of your field and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen might be needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, I mean this is when you
bring in the professional programmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really, really looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also give a lot of insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be very transparent about what the
recommendation is based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, some of these graphical
outputs, and I'll show you just a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is precipitation and nitrogen loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the precip and here's the
nitrogen loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this was quite wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this field lost about 80 pounds of
nitrogen because they had applied a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-plant nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cumulative precipitation, leaching and
gaseous end losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably by next month we'll have the N2O
losses associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mineralized nitrogen and temperature,
of course they're highly correlated as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more graphs, I just want to give
you a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's kind of this broader
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one I wanted to highlight,
and that's Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Walmart has a goal to reduce their
carbon footprint by, I think it's 20
[SPEAKER_00]: million tons per year, which is really
quite ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart did an analysis of their top 10
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind that they're also the
nation's largest grocer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling a lot of groceries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only in the US, they're a global
company, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revenue's equivalent to the GDP of
Belgium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a big player, largest
employer in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Walmart says we want to reduce our
carbon footprint, people start to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart looked at the top 10 products and
found that about 45% of their carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint is associated with nitrogen
fertilizer for the top 100 products,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so they want to reduce that impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're looking at tools like ADAPTEN
to be able to achieve that, which we're
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at an event last week in
Bentonville, and they featured this
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, Tim Richter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an Iowa farmer who's used ADAPTEN,
and he talked about his experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: the tool, which was fortunately very
positive for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's organizations like EDF and TNC
who are really trying to promote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ADAPTEN now is doing is it's
pushing this up the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has agreements from Kellogg's and
General Mills and PepsiCo and Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_00]: and Campbell's Soup, Smithfield Murphy
Brown, large pork producer, for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: start using these kind of tools,
which is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not quite there yet, but we're
getting close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting development was in the
past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had this tool out there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto and DuPont Pioneer come out with
an ADAPTEN type version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, okay, that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't too happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had just licensed the product to this
little startup company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's actually been,
I have to say, especially DuPont Pioneer
[SPEAKER_00]: is somewhat unscrupulous about these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pretend like they invented this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, come on, you guys, you had your
agronomist use our tool for two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and we talked to your chief
agronomist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you didn't invent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least be honest about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's actually been a real
upside to this, because now all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden, everybody thinks that this
approach has a lot of merit, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: big guys jumped into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's actually really benefited us
to see these big companies getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: this technology, because it gave a lot of
credibility to what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is currently where ADAPTEN is
being used, at least as of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a mixture of individual farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consultants were even working with some
larger companies that are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to use ADAPTEN now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to give you a little bit
of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done, especially in New York
and Iowa, we've worked in other states as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, is do strip trials, where you
basically, you go onto farmer's fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you compare the ADAPTEN recommendation
with what the grower normally applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a direct comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for demonstration purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you some good data, and it's kind
of like a boxing match.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a winner and a loser, and so you
can kind of put it in those terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll show you some of the results
from New York and Iowa, and these were all
[SPEAKER_00]: the wonderful collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually, we kind of summarized
the data just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 104 strip trials, so over a three
year period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see the difference in total
end applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, this is the ADAPTEN rate
versus what the grower would normally use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the vast majority of cases,
in 87 out of 104, the ADAPTEN
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation was lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So less nitration was applied,
which is a good thing for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a few cases, we recommended more,
and that was mostly in 2003 when we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: very wet growing season, and a higher rate
was justified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the delta yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, when we said put less
nitration on, but they were able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the average, achieve the same yield,
that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same yield with less nitration,
so less environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a few cases where we said put
more on, that needs to be justified by
[SPEAKER_00]: higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in general the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, the yields were
significantly higher when we said put a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more nitration on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was justified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the nitration still ended up in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the delta profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the vast majority
of cases, in about four out of five cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to show greater profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that's a win-win
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say to farmers, look, we can
increase your profits on the average,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can decrease the amount of
nitration that you apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So limiting the environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically by being more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some of the summary data I just
wanted to point out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you can see the end fertilizer
inputs for Iowa, New York, the three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always were able to reduce the
inputs except in 2013 in New York when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was wet, we said put, on the average,
put a little bit more on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the average, we were able to
significantly reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen that goes into, onto the field
and into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields were in a way positive,
primarily for those, for the cases where
[SPEAKER_00]: we said a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the profit on the average,
about $35 per acre increase in profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll skip the Wisconsin data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can do increased profits,
reduced environmental inputs, and we did
[SPEAKER_00]: some model simulations to look at the
leaching and nitrous oxide losses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel really good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not perfect, but it's a lot better
than what's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel that transparency and
insights, even though it's a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: product, is really valuable still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers and consultants like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it provides incentives for better
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a lot of farmers who are
looking at the losses that they had from,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, an early season application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lost, like in that graph,
they lost 80 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're doing the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, boy, I lost about $50 an
acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should change my strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being transparent and informative helps
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is my last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't mention each of these people
individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've had some great collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very grateful for the multiple
funding sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question, Dee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually relatively difficult to work
with individual farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some who are very high
maintenance, do a lot of correspondence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to focus a little bit more
on the larger companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you can get,
say, Cargill or General Mills to support
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working with Walmart directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asking Walmart, why don't you
sponsor 50,000 acres of the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: Adapt-N?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the way we try to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to get used to the idea that
they have to pay for these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a soil nitrate test and you send
it to a lab, you have to pay for that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cloud computational tools,
it costs money to develop them and to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cost is relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the size, it's generally in
sort of the $152 per acre if it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit larger operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have proved the profit of about
$35.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if we can get more sponsoring,
then that would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the funny things about nitrogen
fertilizations, it's very political and
[SPEAKER_00]: very state-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come up with a tool that kind of
transcends all these individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: because every state has their own
recommendation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of bizarre when you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leftover from many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you come in with a tool that says
the state boundaries don't matter anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because we account for very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variations in soil and climate and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You meet some resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting, especially in the
scientific community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I won't talk more about that
because I can talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
