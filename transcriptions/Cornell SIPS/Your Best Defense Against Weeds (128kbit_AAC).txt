[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds in lawns is the single most popular
complaint we get from most homeowners and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we need to get people to understand
is that the weeds are invading because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're more competitive and they're more
competitive because we are not creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing environment that makes the grass
more competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've just got a few weeds here and
there, hand weeding is always an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where mowing ties in with weeds
because when you mow too low, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are less competitive and when the grass
plants are less competitive, the weeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: more competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can tolerate some small patches of
weeds in your lawn, you shouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: really do much about weed control,
but if you let the weeds get too prolific,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll have more weeds than grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people find that objectionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to find that balance and a lot
of that is mowing properly, feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, irrigating selectively to keep
the grass competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure you've got the right grass for
what it is you're willing to do for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to set your expectations and then
recognize what you're willing to do to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that lawn.
