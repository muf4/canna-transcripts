[SPEAKER_06]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for attending today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am really excited to present on this
topic because what I'm passionate about
[SPEAKER_02]: this, I believe this will help you in your
careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will help you anywhere you go in your
life because presentation skills are
[SPEAKER_02]: skills that you can use anywhere in any
type of job that you get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there are basic communication skills
a lot of times and then just persuading
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody to do something The things that
I'm presenting here, I've actually used in
[SPEAKER_02]: several areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the areas that I actually use is
for personal friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was trying to convince him to go to
Switzerland with me and he did not want to
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't like traveling internationally,
but I know that he did like some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to my presentation skills
and I thought, how do I persuade him to go
[SPEAKER_02]: with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put together an actual presentation
and I emailed it to him and I convinced
[SPEAKER_02]: him actually after 10 years to go to
Switzerland with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only in business, but your personal
life, you can use this also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's estimated that there are 30 million
business presentations given every single
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, what a lot of those
presentations, all they do is to convince
[SPEAKER_02]: the audience that they had wished they'd
never had attended the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to give you some tips on how
to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How not to put your audience to sleep,
but more importantly, to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: convince them to take action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Warren Buffett.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people have heard of Warren
Buffett?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Archibally, he's one of the most
successful investors in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Warren Buffett said that you can
improve your value by 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: By learning communication skills or
presentation skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Mr. Buffett has a single certificate
on his wall in his office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it is, I'll give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not his business certificate,
it's business degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from a class that he took on
presentation skills at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: his career, a Del Carnegie class.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while I couldn't get Mr. Buffett to
personally endorse my class or
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation, I'm sure that he would like
your efforts to increase your presentation
[SPEAKER_02]: or communication skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: MBA programs have long understood and the
value of presentation skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Chicago and Stanford and Harvard,
Wharton, Columbia and Berkeley Haas,
[SPEAKER_02]: and many other MBA programs have included
presentation skills in their programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the unfortunate things is that
people are definitely afraid of
[SPEAKER_02]: presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there was a study done by Harvard
Business School where they asked people,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you rather give a five minute
presentation or for five minutes have
[SPEAKER_02]: electric shocks put through your wrist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what most people chose?
[SPEAKER_02]: They chose to have electric shocks put
through their wrist.
[SPEAKER_02]: In another study, people were asked,
what is your biggest fear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Presentation, giving a speech was number
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Death didn't even make the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jerry Seinfeld said, if you're at a
funeral, most people would rather be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the coffin than giving the eulogy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna help you to, again,
get over some of the fears by giving you
[SPEAKER_02]: the tools and techniques to become a more
competent presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the greatest idea in the
world, but if you cannot persuade enough
[SPEAKER_02]: people, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science, even math, the most fundamental
goal of endeavors is a social activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if somebody has a new theory?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: They go and tell their colleague,
hey, what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's published and it's peer
reviewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a social type of activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to convince others that our ideas
have value and merit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can't, an idea may just fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is for the online presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now as people feel free to enter into
the chat window, some of the challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: that you face, but for the audience that's
here in the room, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges that you face when preparing
presentation content?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just shout it out.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: The balance between overwinding my
presentation or underwinding my
[SPEAKER_04]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, what was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: To find the balance between overwinding my
presentation slides and underwinding them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over, okay, so- Overwording or
underwording.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, overwording and underwording,
yes, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's another one?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's another challenge that you face
when preparing a presentation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The audience knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fitting my presentation to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: The audience knowledge, absolutely
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was another hand up over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, how much that you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: One person said I would have prepared a
shorter presentation, but I didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparing a short presentation often takes
more time than a longer one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of visual aids do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: What type of visual aids that you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Linking topics or slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes, the transitions between
different topics, all the very valid
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to talk to you about
Aristotle and his ideas behind persuasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aristotle was a philosopher that lived
2,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had thoughts on the three most
important aspects of what makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: persuasive argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science has actually validated a lot of
those ideas since that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three ones that he really believed
were important were, in Greek,
[SPEAKER_02]: ethos, pathos, and logos, or credibility,
emotion, and logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He believed that you had to have three
components of a persuasive argument,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you needed to have all three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go and talk about each one of
those components and how they fit into a
[SPEAKER_02]: persuasive argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I have to tell you my background is
in computing science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really thought that this was all that
mattered, logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me over 20 years to actually get
myself off of that and realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: emotion is really important, and
establishing credibility is also really
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: To prepare a persuasive presentation,
you need to be able to establish your
[SPEAKER_02]: credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about making it
memorable with structure, and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: power of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about each one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, let's talk about
credibility, establishing credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for establishing credibility,
you need to provide your credentials
[SPEAKER_02]: upfront.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give your audience a reason on why they
should believe you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really important upfront because
if you do convince your audience that you
[SPEAKER_02]: are believable and credible, that makes
the rest of the presentation that much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you could establish credentials
upfront for yourself, or maybe it's your
[SPEAKER_02]: group, or maybe your company, whatever it
might be, but establishing credibility is
[SPEAKER_02]: really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving your audience a reason to listen to
you, and generally, you want to spend the
[SPEAKER_02]: least amount of time to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spend too much time, you come off
egotistical, look at me, I'm so great,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you do want to establish credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some ways that you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that results are more important
than experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say, yeah, I have 30 years of
experience, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can tell people what results that
you've gotten in the past, that's more
[SPEAKER_02]: important than experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example of what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes me 30 seconds at the beginning of
my classes that I teach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach classes on presentation skills at
Western Digital and outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, my name is Justin Strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have 30 years of presentation
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an instructor and author of
presentation skills at Western Digital,
[SPEAKER_02]: and my classes typically get 4.9 out of 5
stars.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 seconds, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm off to the rest of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have experience here, but more
importantly, results.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, oh, wow, other people have
really enjoyed your class and they've
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten all a lot out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your credibility statement is going to
look a little bit different than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you do need to establish your
credibility, hopefully, at the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: of your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will see you more credible if
somebody else refers to you as an
[SPEAKER_02]: authority on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out that that person doesn't
necessarily need to be an expert
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a study done at a real estate
office where the receptionist would answer
[SPEAKER_02]: the phone in one of two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first way was, I'll put you through to
Mary.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is one of our real estate agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second way was just slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, I'll put you through to Mary.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has 20 years of experience selling
homes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The receptionist is hardly an expert on
real estate agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, just that one small change
results in 20% more customers and 15% more
[SPEAKER_02]: signed contracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could get somebody to introduce you
at the beginning of your presentation and
[SPEAKER_02]: refer to you as an expert in the subject
and however you want to establish your
[SPEAKER_02]: credibility, that will definitely help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to skip this one over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go on to the next one, which is
logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one I think of, and I still
think of when I first, what data do I
[SPEAKER_02]: have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What logical arguments do I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you want to do is
provide structure to your logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example of a presentation where
it had a really good structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Jobs is one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is what I feel is one of the best
product managers that had ever lived.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a product manager at Western Digital,
and I view him as one of the product
[SPEAKER_02]: manager heroes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, his iPhone introduction, the first
presentation when they first revealed the
[SPEAKER_02]: iPhone, was considered one of the best
business presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some of the reasons why.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a structure in his presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A structure went like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, he presented what is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked about all of the phones that
existed at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Blackberry, I think a Nokia,
there was a Palm Trio, and let's see,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a Motorola.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the phones that existed at that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, they have some problems
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a fixed keyboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a fixed keyboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a screen that's relatively
small, and they're not really very easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a stylus that is difficult,
and you always lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, but what if you had a large
screen that took up the whole phone,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you didn't have a fixed keyboard?
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to worry about a stylus
that you could lose, and everything just
[SPEAKER_02]: worked together like magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, what is the current situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: What could be?
[SPEAKER_02]: What if you had this, and then he
introduced the solution, the iPhone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very simple structure in his presentation,
but really served as a way to describe his
[SPEAKER_02]: solution to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of different structures that
you can use, but the point is here is that
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have a logical argument in data,
when you put it into a structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's easier for your audience to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there was a Stanford study that
said people are 40% more liable to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember data that's structured rather
than unstructured.
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure that you use is what is,
but what if, and here's my solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use this in a lot of your
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the current situation, the problem
that we face, but what if we didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to deal with those problems, and then you
have your audience ready for your
[SPEAKER_02]: solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a lot of times what people do is
they'll put the solution up front,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's certainly a valid way of
presenting, but this is also a very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting and good way because it sets
your audience up to really want your
[SPEAKER_02]: solution because they identify with the
problems that you're telling them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you say, hey, what if you didn't have
to deal with those problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yes, yes, how can you solve
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you present your solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would do your opening, and let's say
five reasons why cloud storage will double
[SPEAKER_02]: over the next three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the global cloud storage leader,
and then you're closing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another structure that you can
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your opening, you've got five
reasons why your particular proposal is
[SPEAKER_02]: true, and then you're telling your
audience hey, we're the global cloud
[SPEAKER_02]: storage leaders, and then you have your
closing, which may contain a call to
[SPEAKER_02]: action to ask your audience, hey,
check out our website if you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd like to use our cloud storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing you want to do is make your
data relevant to your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a comment at the beginning on,
hey, how do I make sure that my audience
[SPEAKER_02]: will understand what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things you want to do is
make your data relevant to your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's an example of how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say that you work for a solar
company, a company that produces solar
[SPEAKER_02]: panels, and you said our company saved one
billion kilowatt hours of electricity in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're not part of the solar
industry, you might say, what's a kilowatt
[SPEAKER_02]: hour?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is a billion very much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 1% of all?
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not know if you're in the
industry, but if you count it in different
[SPEAKER_02]: terms, you say our company saved 15
minutes of all of the electricity
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all of a sudden, even if your
audience is not in the electricity or
[SPEAKER_02]: solar power energy industry, they're going
to understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to ensure that, one,
you want to understand who you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're talking to members of your
audience who are in your particular
[SPEAKER_02]: profession, then it's OK to use technical
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may be perfectly valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have members of your audience
who aren't in your particular industry or
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know, this may be a lot easier
for your audience to relate to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you make data relevant to your
audience, they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it a lot easier and then relate
to what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are a couple of suggestions when
you have logic and data to present to your
[SPEAKER_02]: audience, how you can make it easier for
your audience to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, put it into a structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, make data relevant to your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a lot of other techniques and
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teach a two day class in my company,
and we only have less than an hour here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I gave you a couple of principles,
but there's certainly a lot more that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are two principles that
definitely will help you to make your
[SPEAKER_02]: logical arguments more relevant to your
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So number three, emotion, the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the one that I struggled with a
lot of times, because one, I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't this just manipulating your audience
with emotion?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see those ads for starving kids
in Africa, and then you see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought people are just manipulating
your emotions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really have changed my thinking
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And realized that emotion is an integral
part of our decision making process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it's an integral part of us
taking action on any argument that we
[SPEAKER_02]: hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about the science behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data leads us to conclusions,
but emotion leads us to action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data leads us to conclusions, but emotion
leads us to action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Antonio Damasio is a social scientist,
and his specialty is decision making and
[SPEAKER_02]: emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of his most interesting
experiments were with people whose
[SPEAKER_02]: emotional part of their brain was not
functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people could not feel any emotion at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you would think that they would be
the best decision makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would make totally logical decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be like Spock, and not have to
be impacted by their emotions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turned out the exact opposite was
the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: That those people whose emotional part of
their brain was damaged, and they couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: feel any emotion at all, could not make
any decisions at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't decide what to wear in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't decide what to eat for
breakfast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't decide what shoes to put on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when Antonio asked the subjects in
this experiment, hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: How come you can't make any decisions?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, well, we know what we should
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't bring ourselves to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data leads us to conclusion,
but emotion will lead us to take action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what do we do with it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to make your audience cry in
every presentation that you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: or make them laugh, or whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not really, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a way that you can bring out
emotions in your audience that are
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly valid, and are not manipulative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the best ways to do that is
through storytelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Storytelling will elicit emotions in
people in a non-manipulative way,
[SPEAKER_02]: and help them to take action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are born storytellers, and storytellers
are story listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we used to use stories to
transmit vital information that we needed
[SPEAKER_02]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to transmit information.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would sit around the fire at night
and tell each other how they survived
[SPEAKER_02]: during a drought, or what happened when
the herds went away and they had to find
[SPEAKER_02]: new places to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that storytelling is how we
transmitted vital information that we
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are wired for storytelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we use that in a business
environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't believe in the power of
storytelling until one day I had to give a
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been on a business trip to the UK,
and I'd been there for a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were working with the largest
cellular phone provider in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were working on a project with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was there for a month, and helping
them with the implementation and the
[SPEAKER_02]: project, and then I came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came back on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was back in the office on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Friday morning, my boss came to me and
said, the executives want you to present
[SPEAKER_02]: what your findings were.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want you to talk about what results
that you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little bit nervous, because while
we had some achievements, we didn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of data to present.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had presented to the executives
before I left, and I put business case
[SPEAKER_02]: after business case together, showing what
return on investment that we would get.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, before I went, I knew that our
project was at risk of being defunded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really have any new data to
present, and I really believed that you
[SPEAKER_02]: should really make data-based decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really didn't have a lot of new data
to present, but I did have some stories to
[SPEAKER_02]: present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't refuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went into the presentation with
all the executives, and I told stories
[SPEAKER_02]: about how the customer was happy about
what we were doing, about how they had
[SPEAKER_02]: some successes in some of the areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finished the presentation,
and I thought, well, OK, I guess whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: will happen will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday morning, I came in my boss goes,
Justin, congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The executives want to fully fund your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't present any new data on all my
business cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were lukewarm responses to them,
and yet I told stories, and now all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden they want to fully fund the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, it took me years after that
to really comprehend the power of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I had done research on
the power of story and then thought back
[SPEAKER_02]: to that experience, and I had my aha
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stories really do have power to lead
people to take action.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Data is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also need stories to help bring it
to life and to lead your audience to take
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richard Branson, how many people have
heard of him?
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the CEO of Virgin Enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, regardless of the medium,
there is nothing more effective and
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting than storytelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year, he brings his top executives
to his private island, Necker Island,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they gather around a virtual fire,
and they tell stories about their business
[SPEAKER_02]: and their successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he really believes in that power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerome Bruner, he's an education
researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says when you have data that's couched
in story, people are 22 times more likely
[SPEAKER_02]: to remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More times likely to remember data that's
in a story than not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the analysis of TED Talks,
500 TED Talks, someone did analysis of 500
[SPEAKER_02]: TED Talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it was Carmine Gallo.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a very famous speaker, and he wrote a
book called The Storyteller's Secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did analysis of 500 TED Talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at the percentage of those
talks that were emotion, story,
[SPEAKER_02]: data, and credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what percentage of it was involved with
storytelling or emotion, data,
[SPEAKER_02]: and credibility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just going to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, 65% was data, emotion, and
storytelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, before I go any further, how many
people have not heard of TED Talks?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I just want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some audience that I talked to,
some people haven't heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% was data, and 10% was credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: TED Talks are considered, I think,
in a lot of people's career, the pinnacle
[SPEAKER_02]: of presentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get invited to do a TED Talk,
you're considered one of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: storytellers or presenters in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the world's best presenters,
65% of their presentations are
[SPEAKER_02]: storytelling or emotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you another example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for a company called Western
Digital.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make hard drives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We own the company called Sandisk,
which makes flash memory, flash memory
[SPEAKER_02]: cards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're totally data-driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I went to, let's say I was doing a
customer presentation, and I said 65% of
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers lost data from a computer or
mobile device in 2019, now that's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It leads you to conclusions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what if I added a story to that and
said, my hard drive failed last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I lost all the photos from the first
three years of my children's life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just imagine how upset my wife was.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife laughs because this has some truth
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you tell a story, and now people
are like, oh, I don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to find a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: What solution do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: So data leads you to conclusions,
but a story, and this is a very short
[SPEAKER_02]: story, but would lead you to take action,
because now you see how it applies to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data leads you to conclusions of
storytelling or motion leads you to
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you need both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, can you tell an effective story in
two sentences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, another kind of personal story.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife came to me and said, hey,
we should get an Apple TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next sentence, wait,
what is an Apple TV anyway?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the power of brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was so enamored with Apple products
that Apple and TV, I had to have one,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though she had no idea what it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, you can tell an effective story in
just a couple of sentences.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to have long stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you don't have to have a story
that's really exciting or overwhelming to
[SPEAKER_02]: your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's sincere and it's relevant to
the topic that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things you have to
remember when you choose a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be related to the topic that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stories are great, but maybe great
for another presentation and not this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so in summary, we have three aspects
to a persuasive presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have a really persuasive one,
you want to have all three.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have, of course, your data and
your logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to establish your credibility
upfront and then ideally have some type of
[SPEAKER_02]: a story in your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Star, how are we doing for time?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's yeah, if you can finish one minute.
[SPEAKER_08]: One minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will wrap up.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I do also,
and this is I got to use one minute to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about this, is that I use a content
development worksheet and I'll send this
[SPEAKER_02]: to you so that you can look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use what I call content development
worksheet for every presentation that I
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it for my friend's presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it when I had to do a eulogy last
year for my best friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it contain?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you want to know who your
audience is and what do they care about
[SPEAKER_02]: your outcomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want your audience to know as
a result of your presentation and what do
[SPEAKER_02]: you want them to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's your supporting material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is your logic.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the need of your presentation,
your topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a reminder here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use emotion, logic, and credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is you want to have a structure in
this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you have your structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, your opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may sound counterintuitive,
but I do my opening after I do all this
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Capture your attention of your audience,
establish your credentials, and then your
[SPEAKER_02]: closing, summarize, and have a call to
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that you want your audience to
do as a result of your presentation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget to leave this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost always you should have some type of
thing that you want your audience to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may just be go to my website,
read my paper, take a look at this data,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is, but you should have
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, what's the point of the
presentation?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want your audience usually to do
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is part of the content development
worksheet that will link you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's your assignment, my call to
action for your next presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, add a story to your next
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might find this difficult,
but I found that if I really look,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a story in almost every
presentation, even if it's very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very technical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Establish your credibility at the
beginning of your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three, use the content
development worksheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we'll send it out to you so
that you have a copy of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you very much for
listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so for people on the line,
also in the room, I did a terrible job in
[SPEAKER_08]: establishing Justin's credibility by
introducing him, but that was not an
[SPEAKER_08]: accident, okay, it's intentional.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to do the assignment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to tell your story.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, okay, that's my assignment to
tell a story.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was struggling with persuading my
audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too much data.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the feedback from many,
many people, including maybe Kelly and
[SPEAKER_08]: many, many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I did a EMBA last two years while
finishing, while doing my full-time job.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I graduated in May.
[SPEAKER_08]: After that, I felt, they taught me how to
handle the data, all the analytics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took the digital transformation,
this and that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't really help me to be more
effective in persuading people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then what I did was this summer,
I joined a cloud called Korea Bootcamp,
[SPEAKER_08]: where I met Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he taught about this seminar.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as he mentioned, yeah, so the
persuasive take action.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was persuading, so I took action.
[SPEAKER_08]: I emailed him and I thought I could invite
him to talk to all of you on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's from California, okay, working in
Vice and Digital.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how sincere he is, he's here in
person.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so hopefully you have a
wonderful, learning and now time for your
[SPEAKER_08]: questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, before I tell you more story because
I have a lot to share, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, come to Toastmaster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I do a plug there, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in addition to the on Zoom open
everywhere, yeah, locally, we also have
[SPEAKER_08]: Toastmaster Club, public speaking.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as students and faculty and other
people from Cornell, outside Cornell,
[SPEAKER_08]: we are very diverse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Age, profession, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's helped me to be comfortable here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I guess a quick question on a
curiosity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I'm sort of so tied to like
using PowerPoint and kind of sort of these
[SPEAKER_00]: standard ways of putting together
PowerPoint presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: As someone that specializes in this,
do you have any recommendations of other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of putting together a presentation
that's maybe not so PowerPoint reliant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, instead of PowerPoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, it really depends on the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of presentations, but if you
listen to TED Talks, some of the talks
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have any slides at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's perfectly valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slides though, if you do have them,
should support you as the presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the star of the show, not your
slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: The slides should be supporting you and
should be showing some information but you
[SPEAKER_02]: are the person that they have come to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they can just take your slides
and just watch them at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that if you do have slides
that they are supporting you and not the
[SPEAKER_02]: focus of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should always be the focus of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a perfectly valid
presentation without any slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as are there other options
other than slides where you can have a
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sure, one would be to have some type
of an object or objects that you bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can have a combination of slides
and objects that you have in your
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used different techniques within
PowerPoint and Zoom.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Star, did you attend the presentation on
how to present like a broadcaster?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what I did is that there is
capability within Zoom to take your
[SPEAKER_02]: PowerPoint presentation and put it as a
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I created a virtual
broadcasting studio in PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a suit on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got myself situated and looked like I
was actually behind a desk in a
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation in a broadcast studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave my presentation that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look into PowerPoint and Zoom,
look into a feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beta feature, I think, in Zoom on
using PowerPoint as a background.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can use PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you kind of are almost immersed in
the presentation itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also within, I don't know if you can use
Teams at all here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in Teams, you can present.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's different presenter views where
you actually bring yourself into the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of the presentation or on the side
and your slides are right beside you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to do that because instead of
just being a little boxed onto the side,
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually are in your presentation
right next to your slides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another way that you can bring
yourself and bring yourself front and
[SPEAKER_02]: center rather than, I call it,
presenting outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're actually more of a part of the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if I fully answered your
question, but there's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few things that you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for that presentation,
which I find timely because I was just
[SPEAKER_05]: contemplating presentation that I have to
give.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the tips that you're
bringing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like my questions are almost
for the group because I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: interpret a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering how they would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Starr is really a good person to
help with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is a call to action in our science
topic?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying you're a grad student or
postdoc.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're giving your research topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be appropriate to regard as
being in the call to action?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even how do we interpret the word
story in the kind of work that we actually
[SPEAKER_05]: do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not saying that's that hard a
question, but it's still examples of what
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of would count or be powerful in
that, in our context.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're the right person to
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me answer one of your questions
that you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I get from a lot of
people within who are in engineering and
[SPEAKER_02]: finance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say, there's no stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying you can always find a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one example is, let's say that you're
presenting the end of the quarter numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, okay, we made $40 million
and we achieved and we had a $10 million
[SPEAKER_02]: problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, those are just numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have finance people that tell me,
how do I put a story in?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no story behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there always is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say today, and actually last week I
went to the CFO and I told him,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an envelope sitting on this desk
and in it is our end of the quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what they were?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I think it was about 35
million.
No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a little bit higher, 38 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, higher, higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this more than 38?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 39.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it was 40 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, very simple story, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might think, well, it probably
doesn't have a lot of meaning,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when you couch a number in a story,
people are more likely to remember that
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that statistic where Jerome
Brunner said you're 24 times likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: remember a number if it's couched in a
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if I told the story like that,
and how more likely do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: people are to remember the 40 million
number than if I just said, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: here's our numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got $40 million of revenue and we
achieved $10 million in profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very simple story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, your stories don't have to be
complicated and overly dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be a very simple story,
but if they're sincere and if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: related to the topic that you're talking
about, it could be a struggle that you had
[SPEAKER_02]: in getting some of the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a funny incident that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take your data and wrap it in
some type of a story, your audience is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to remember it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things that you want
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad truth is, this is that probably
about 50% of your presentation and more
[SPEAKER_02]: will be forgotten within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the challenges that you
have as a presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get your audience to remember
what you said for a longer period of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: The stories are definitely one way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about the call to action?
[SPEAKER_02]: Call to action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think I've turned to the audience
to say, hey, what are some suggestions
[SPEAKER_02]: that people might have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think they would probably know
that better than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the subject matter expert in what
you're talking about.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought of a call to action as you
conclude the presentation, but then you
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about the next steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to add emotion, you would add the
impact of what doing those next steps
[SPEAKER_04]: would mean for your subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of your call to action to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that count?
[SPEAKER_05]: That can be, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with the call to action as
next steps makes a lot of sense,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it can be a call to action for
yourself, but also especially as students
[SPEAKER_06]: who generally will have a small part of
the project.
[SPEAKER_06]: The call to action is to your field and
saying, this is what I've added.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these would be the next logical steps
of encouragement that you hope that
[SPEAKER_06]: someone else will take on the research and
help develop your ideas further.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be, hey, does anybody have any
suggestions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can try to.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that we don't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to have people suggest some
things that we could maybe some directions
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could take.
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be several different things,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you want people to go to your
website, a website, or to a paper or
[SPEAKER_02]: something to get more information,
that could be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're interested, this is where you go
for more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing I always do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that for more information, here's where
you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, Rebecca, one thing I can think
of is why the power of social media.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see it's rising.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a part of once, personally,
you want to take action.
[SPEAKER_08]: And through your own posting, your own
blogging, that can really get a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people really see the impact on
themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's more powerful than even send a
real publication proposal sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, in terms of credibility,
you talk about storytelling, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: injecting that in your presentation can
add value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of credibility, if it's a
story that you're sharing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: directly yourself experience versus maybe
telling a story that you heard about that
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else, is there a fine line there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter in terms of credibility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for credibility, do you mean whether
people will believe like story that
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much believe, but just in terms of
adding that value, that credibility to
[SPEAKER_01]: your to your to your speech, does it carry
more weight if you yourself experience
[SPEAKER_01]: versus somebody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so there's a couple of different
aspects of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly a personal story is usually of
more interest to the audience when you
[SPEAKER_02]: tell a story of something that happened to
you personally, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about something where you want to
convince your audience to do something and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can tell a story about how you have
been impacted by it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I told a story about how I was impacted
by storytelling and and how it impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I told a story about somebody
else, I think that's perfectly valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's something a little bit
different and a little bit more impactful
[SPEAKER_02]: when you tell a story about that's
personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what actually happened to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So both are definitely very valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can't find us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a story yourself,
a personal story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely very valid to use and I
think can be really, really impactful if
[SPEAKER_02]: you tell a story that is related to your
presentation, but somebody else
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the people on the line,
if you have a question, let me give you
[SPEAKER_08]: one chance.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, yeah, the last question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just say for the people on the line,
anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just unmute yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or send it through the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if not, there's still more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Justin is going to meet a graduate
student for lunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: So graduate students are not continuing on
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's give one more round of applause
to Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I really think, Justin,
the value he brings is from a very
[SPEAKER_08]: technical background, computer science.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt his worksheets, also all the
techniques, tools is very easy to follow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So three things to be persuasive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can all replicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just multiply.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you see this as a value,
we can definitely invite Justin back
[SPEAKER_08]: online or in person in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can continue on.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, with that, please join the lunch with
Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
