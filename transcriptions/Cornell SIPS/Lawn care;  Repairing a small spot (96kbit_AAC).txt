[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is a very common dog spot
injury that many people have around their
[SPEAKER_00]: yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly easy to remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing you want to do is remove the
debris that's been burned from the dog's
[SPEAKER_00]: urine and just get a rake and kind of just
dig yourself up here and you see how nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy it comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we're a little bit below
grade here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some compost here from the
backyard that we've got and what I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is add a handful of seed into my
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have just a little bit of soil and about
a handful of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mix it up and you should be able to
see plenty of seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start adding it to the hole,
establishing a little bit of a grade here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to establish intimate contact
between the seed and soil so the seed can
[SPEAKER_00]: extract water from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just get and step down a little bit
and you're all set.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
