[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Karen, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, oh, can you hear me?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great to see all of you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very excited to present my
research on root and rice shear processes
[SPEAKER_01]: in forest soils today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually not the first Dutch person to
observe roots or study roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Fintan van Gogh was way ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He observed and painted tree roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for him that he got so
interested in roots was because to him,
[SPEAKER_01]: tree roots represented the struggle of
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he wasn't the most optimistic
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not use roots as a metaphor of my
own life or even of my own PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would argue that roots can really be
a struggle to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hidden away in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hard to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to observe them under
natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you find methods or use older
methods to study them and learn new things
[SPEAKER_01]: about them, they are truly fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, they play a very
important role in the cycling of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: and nutrients through our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would argue that studying them is
definitely worth the struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you agree with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots that van Gogh painted here
are more woody, structural roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are not the roots that I was
interested in for my dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots I was interested in are fine
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really the smallest roots of
the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking really about the millimeter
scale here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these roots are also ephemeral,
meaning that after a certain period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, they're shed just like leaves on a
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unlike leaves on the tree,
they're in their production season and
[SPEAKER_01]: their death season, so to say,
are variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their lifespan can really vary from a
few days up to a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also the part of the root system
that's in charge of taking up water and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the roots that associate with
beneficial microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also the part of the root
system that can quickly respond to changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can do that by producing roots in
more roots in an area of the soil where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's higher nutrients availability or
resource availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can also do this by changing
their lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides responding to the environment,
they also have the ability to modify the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil right around these roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the biological characteristics,
the physical characteristics, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical characteristics around the roots
in the soil are very different from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons for this is root
exudation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the process by which roots
release chemicals into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will talk more about this in a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the ecosystem scale, fine roots growth
dynamics are a very important part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, more than or around 50% of all
organic carbon found on land is stored in
[SPEAKER_01]: forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big part of that pool is found below
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the context of climate change,
one of the big questions is, what is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen with this huge pool of carbon
stored in forests?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons that we aren't able
to answer that question yet is because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a very limited understanding of
root-soil interactions and about how
[SPEAKER_01]: changes in the environment may change
those interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the aim of my dissertation was to
enhance our understanding of root-soil
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions in a changing climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did this by studying two different
components within this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part of my dissertation is
about the effect of drought on fine root
[SPEAKER_01]: production and lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second part of my
presentation or my dissertation is about
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect of root exudation on soil
organic matter dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is also the way that I will
guide you through my talk today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first part of my dissertation,
the effects of drought on fine roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually took place in Germany in
collaboration with the Technical
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Munich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was lucky enough to be able to take
advantage of this through fall exclusion
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure that has been installed in
one of the forests nearby to study the
[SPEAKER_01]: response of fine roots to drought at the
field scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And studying root responses to water
resources in the soil is particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky because we expect drought to affect
fine root production in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, water resources are gonna
be more limiting in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so usually when we think of a plant
growing in an environment with limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: soil resources, the expectation is that
the plant would invest more biomass and
[SPEAKER_01]: more carbon below ground to forage for
those resources and really spend its
[SPEAKER_01]: energy on finding those resources in the
soil and taking them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, in the scenario of a drought,
drought is also gonna influence the above
[SPEAKER_01]: ground physiology of the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the main strategies by which
trees can minimize water loss is through
[SPEAKER_01]: closing the stomata in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also means that less CO2 can be
taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we get into a scenario where
maybe the tree is limited in carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: resources and therefore also has limited
resources to spend on root production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's really these two different
effects that take place and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: predict because of that what would happen
to fine root growth dynamics below ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so studying the effect of drought in
temperate forest ecosystems is important
[SPEAKER_01]: because the duration, the frequency and
severity of drought is predicted to go up
[SPEAKER_01]: even in areas where trees are usually not
water limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: An additional reason for foresters and
this is I was working or collaborating
[SPEAKER_01]: with foresters at the Technical University
of Munich is that one of their most
[SPEAKER_01]: economically important trees is Norway
spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this tree species is particularly
vulnerable to drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might be partly due to a shallow
root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these roots are in the layer of the
soil that is gonna dry out the fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these trees are mainly grown in
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an additional question is like why,
what kind of management strategies could
[SPEAKER_01]: we find to mitigate these negative effects
of drought on the root system of Norway
[SPEAKER_01]: spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this background in mind,
I tested two hypothesis in this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one being that drought reduces
fine root productions but will increase
[SPEAKER_01]: root lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rationale behind this was is that
the tree will have limited carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: resources to build more roots but to
compensate for the fine roots that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already there are gonna live for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My second hypothesis was that mixed
species arrangements will buffer the
[SPEAKER_01]: negative effect of drought on fine root
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to further explain why I think that's
gonna happen, I have a little diagram
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine a forest, a monoculture
forest of spruce trees on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's gonna be a lot of fine
roots in that upper layer of the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna be competing for those
limited resources that are already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: While if you have a forest where there's
spruce trees and beach trees, so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the other species that I studied here,
there's gonna be fewer, the distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: of roots will be more even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so also resources can be shared more
efficiently and more equally, more evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, because beach has a
deeper root system, there might be other
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms by which beach can facilitate
fine root production of spruce,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, by hydraulic leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I tested these hypothesis was
through a four year long field study at
[SPEAKER_01]: the site of which I already showed a
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this field site had 10 research plots
that had a species gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see in the diagram in the
middle of the plot, you see a mixed zone
[SPEAKER_01]: of both beach and spruce trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the side, monocultures of
beach or spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then half of these plots through fall
exclusion roofs were installed on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these roofs would close if it was
raining, but then also during the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: months, they were also left open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the idea was here to study the
effect of seasonal, like summer droughts
[SPEAKER_01]: or drought during the growing season on
fine root production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still let some soil moisture be
charged during the winter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I observed the fine roots
was by using linear isotron methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a tube here, well,
the outside of the tube here, but it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: down to 50 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tube is see-through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then with cameras, we can monitor if
any new fine roots are produced or how old
[SPEAKER_01]: the fine roots are that are already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to really come back every
two weeks to keep on monitoring these
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to thank undergraduate
researchers from the Technical University
[SPEAKER_01]: of Munich for this, because they were
really the one that did this most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had 60 tubes in total,
so it's six tubes per plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 44 pictures per tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we would come back every two
weeks for almost four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of root pictures to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different members of the Mbauerli lab
helped me with analyzing all these
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I see Tommy sitting here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while there's a whole big group,
and Max even, our lab technician helps,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to also thank all of you for all
your help there, because I really couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have gotten through all those pictures by
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had soil moisture sensors
installed into the plots so that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: double check that these through-full
exclusion roofs were actually doing their
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a graph where we see soil
moisture in the upper 10 centimeters of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had sensors installed deeper down
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is soil moisture over the years
of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're also marked when the
roofs were closed versus when they were
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing that I want you to take
away from this graph is that we have three
[SPEAKER_01]: red lines, which represent the drought
treatment, and three blue lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were soil moisture sensors
in the beach sprues and mixed stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want you to take away from this
is that the drought treatment is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get reduced soil moisture when the
roofs are closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we can see that even when the
roofs are open, soil moisture isn't fully
[SPEAKER_01]: recharged.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first results that I'm sharing with
you are on the total amount of fine woods
[SPEAKER_01]: that were produced during the four years
of this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have, I'm showing here fine wood
production of beach and spruce,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then in the control plot and in the
drought plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see that drought indeed
significantly affected fine wood
[SPEAKER_01]: production of spruce and slightly of
beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in line with our hypothesis that
we thought that drought was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce fine wood production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we look at the mixed zone of the
plot, so this is the total fine wood
[SPEAKER_01]: production of both beach and spruce
together, we do not see a reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: fine wood production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also in line with what I have
hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can also look at fine wood
production by depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I'm showing you fine wood
production of spruce and beach in the
[SPEAKER_01]: single species zone of the plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see that fine wood production is
reduced in the upper layers, but also in
[SPEAKER_01]: the deeper layers of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though in the deeper layers of the
soil, soil moisture was higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: we still see this reduction, which
suggests that the trees indeed may have
[SPEAKER_01]: been carbon limited, so just couldn't
produce as many roots as they might have
[SPEAKER_01]: under more ideal conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we look at the mixed species zone,
we do not see this effect of drought on
[SPEAKER_01]: this fine wood production of spruce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at none of the layers, we see a
reduction in fine wood production,
[SPEAKER_01]: while beach still shows a decrease in fine
wood production from 10 to 20 centimeters
[SPEAKER_01]: soil depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can kind of average the results
here over those depth layers to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: summarize the results that we see in the
mixed versus the single species plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see that beach is equally
affected by the drought in the single and
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed species zone, while spruce is only
affected by the drought in the single
[SPEAKER_01]: species zone, but not in the mixed species
zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of this result for spruce
might be explained by looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences in soil moisture between the
single species zone of spruce and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed species zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the soil water content
in the drought plots of the mixed species
[SPEAKER_01]: and spruce zone, we see that the soil
moisture in the mixed species zone is
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly higher than in the single
species zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that may explain part of why we see
that spruce is less affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: drought in the mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to estimate a fine wood lifespan of
the roots that I was observing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used Cox proportional hazard models and
Kaplan-Meier estimates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found for medium lifespan is
that both for spruce and beach,
[SPEAKER_01]: drought increased the fine wood lifespan
in both the mixed and the single species
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also in line with what I
hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if we then look over these,
when we look at this over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so a different way to look at medium
lifespan or something that is related to
[SPEAKER_01]: fine wood lifespan is looking at the
hazard ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can look at the risk of death in
the drought versus the control plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a hazard ratio less than one in
this case means that there's a lower risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of mortality in the drought plots,
while a hazard ratio that is higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: one means a higher risk in the drought
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see for spruce here that
throughout the years, its hazard ratio is
[SPEAKER_01]: below one and the first three years,
it's significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like its response is quite
steady in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, for beach, we only see a reduced
risk of mortality, which would be linked
[SPEAKER_01]: to a longer lifespan in the first year of
the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the next few years,
that changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests that maybe for beach,
this isn't a sustained strategy under
[SPEAKER_01]: repeated episodes of summer drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it's utilizing other strategies
to deal with this reduced soil moisture in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, or moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall, what do these results mean for
carbon cycling in forests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we have less fine root production
and the fine roots that are already there
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting older, that means that there's
going to be less fine root turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rate and amount at which carbon
would be transferred to a soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter pool is going to decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it seems that if we look at mixed
species arrangements or mixed species
[SPEAKER_01]: forests, that this negative effect of
drought may be mitigated to a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially because spruce is the one
that is benefiting from this mixed species
[SPEAKER_01]: composition, it seems like this could be a
better forest management strategy if
[SPEAKER_01]: foresters want to cultivate Norway spruce
in a climate where maybe more drought
[SPEAKER_01]: periods are to be expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me to the second part of my
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this second part, I studied the effect
of root exudate chemistry on soil carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: My interest in soil science aren't new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my masters, like Perrin already
said, in soil science with Johannes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, my interest in soil go even
further back than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me as a child practicing my soil
sampling skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for everyone that has asked me over
the years if we wear clogs or wooden shoes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Netherlands, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the proof for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm practicing my soil sampling
skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look a little confused because
there's no organic matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really, this area where roots and
the soil meet is an area in the soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: I find very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this interface is also called the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really the place where roots
interact with a diverse community of
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, invertebrates,
other plant species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately, this region of the soil has
also been labeled as a hotspot of
[SPEAKER_01]: biological activity, meaning that we can
observe accelerated rates of carbon and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycling in this zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a recent study showed that these
rhizosphere processes may be responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: for up to one third of all soil carbon
mineralized in forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this phenomenon is also called root
priming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people have proposed different
mechanisms for why this is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the main mechanisms attributes
this effect to root exudation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea of roots releasing chemicals
into the soil that then results in an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase or decrease in soil organic
matter decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to explain this hypothesis
that's out there in a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: detail, we can start with imagining a soil
without any roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they show there's a big soil carbon
pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some microbes living in that
soil that are chewing away on this soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the carbon is leaving the
system as CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what has been commonly
hypothesized is what happens when we
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce roots into the system is that
roots are exuding label carbon compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic compounds, that are easy to break
down that then either increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: activity of the microbes that live there
or even the abundance of the microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which then results in them also
decomposing more of this carbon soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter pool, which then results
overall in a larger flux of CO2 leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, some of this CO2 is coming
from the exudates that are degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that is coming from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, my question was when I read about
this, is this really true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this really true for all exudates that
are being exuded?
[SPEAKER_01]: So roots exude a very wide variety of
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the majority of those
chemicals we haven't even identified yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even know the variety of
chemicals that is being exuded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also don't know how these
different chemicals would affect the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really, we also don't really know
what would happen if we see no change at
[SPEAKER_01]: all in increase or decrease in soil
organic matter decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read studies on root priming
that have been done with different plant
[SPEAKER_01]: species, you indeed find that sometimes
soil microbial respiration is increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's no effect at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're missing out on a full explanation
of the mechanisms that play a role in this
[SPEAKER_01]: root priming phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the reasons why I think this
hypothesis that I just explained or this
[SPEAKER_01]: food resource hypothesis of label
compounds got so much support is because
[SPEAKER_01]: when these experiments were designed to
study this phenomenon in the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly glucose was used as a proxy for
root exudation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these were simple soil incubations
where either artificial roots were
[SPEAKER_01]: created, as an example I give you on the
slide, or just compounds were added by
[SPEAKER_01]: pipetting them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the effect of glucose on soil
carbon cycling was measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, like I've already been
emphasizing, roots exude a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one really large group of compounds
that has been largely ignored in these
[SPEAKER_01]: root priming studies are secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so secondary metabolites are expected
to show a higher variation across species,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the group of compounds that I
thought was important to study have been
[SPEAKER_01]: studying in soils and have been shown to
have different functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just a food source, but they can in
certain cases be toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can decrease enzyme activities or
inhibit enzyme activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They play a role in plant micro signaling,
and they can mobilize other resources that
[SPEAKER_01]: might have been immobilized in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of other functions that
could be, or a lot of other mechanisms
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be playing a role here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I designed two experiments to really
test one hypothesis, which was that root
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic compounds do not function as a
microbial food source, but influence soil
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon cycling through other mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the first experiment that I
designed started with identifying the
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates of six different tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I didn't even know which
phenolic compounds were exuded,
[SPEAKER_01]: then how could I test their effect on
rhizosphere biogeochemistry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I grew three species in the
greenhouse in a medium that didn't contain
[SPEAKER_01]: any organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I transferred them to
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, I measured their exudates
by putting them in individual jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cellulose acetate strips,
I sampled the phenolics from that
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for this part of my experiment,
I want to thank Andre Kessler,
[SPEAKER_01]: with whom I collaborated a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a struggle in the beginning to
find a method that was working to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with these phenolics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to thank the rest of his
lab for.
[SPEAKER_01]: helping with HPLC analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then after I identified these
compounds, the next step was to test the
[SPEAKER_01]: subset of these on soil microbial
respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have my control soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then similar to what other incubation
studies that we're looking at root priming
[SPEAKER_01]: or priming have done, I added different
phenolic compounds to the soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: measured soil microbial respiration using
potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so about measuring root exudates,
I would say this was really the struggle
[SPEAKER_01]: of my PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very challenging to measure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're working with very small
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually started with my first idea
was to measure root exudation even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: forest in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I brought it to a smaller scale
outside, still growing the roots in a
[SPEAKER_01]: potted medium and try to excavate parts of
the root system and put them in tubes and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to catch root exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of this was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how, in the end, I ended up in
the greenhouse with a hydropodic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see, I look quite happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it worked out in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so with this method, I identified
181 unique root exudates that belong to
[SPEAKER_01]: nine different biosynthetic classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out of these 181 exudates,
I only found five matches with standards
[SPEAKER_01]: that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just demonstrates really the big
diversity of chemicals that we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: identified yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I was able to, for most
chemicals, put them into a biosynthetic or
[SPEAKER_01]: assign a biosynthetic class to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did have some extra information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I wanted to answer this question
of how unique these phenolic profiles were
[SPEAKER_01]: among species, so how species specific
they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used an NMDS analysis for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way that you can interpret this
plot is that points that are closer
[SPEAKER_01]: together are more similar and data points
that are further apart are more
[SPEAKER_01]: dissimilar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tested six different tree species
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, they cluster quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite tightly together, meaning that these
phenolic profiles were very unique to that
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we also see some overlap in the
case of oak and beech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then out of those, I tried to test
a subset of these phenolic compounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: tested their effect on soil microbial
respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to choose compounds that
belonged to the different chemical classes
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here you see those chemicals on the
apexes and then the amount of CO2 that was
[SPEAKER_01]: respired over a five-day period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I included glucose as a positive
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see the control that didn't
receive any phenolic addition in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle, in dark blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I want you to take away from
this graph is that you can see that
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic compounds can both increase,
decrease, or have no effect on soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this goes already against this most
common hypothesis or common mechanism that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been proposed to explain root priming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then an additional thing that I found was
very interesting when looking at these
[SPEAKER_01]: results is that it seems that the
biosynthetic class that the compound
[SPEAKER_01]: belongs to is not determining whether this
compound is going to have a negative,
[SPEAKER_01]: a positive, or no effect on respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, there's three flavonoid
compounds in this graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can, naringenin is increasing
respiration, while texifolin and catechin
[SPEAKER_01]: are decreasing respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then additionally, if you look at the
compounds that suppressed respiration,
[SPEAKER_01]: so those are the ones in red, they all
share the same functional group,
[SPEAKER_01]: catechol group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this supports the hypothesis that
maybe functional group of the compound is
[SPEAKER_01]: more important in determining the
compounds effect on soil microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration than the biosynthetic class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for my next study, I want you to
remember these three compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: so benzoic acid, that increased
respiration, and then cafeic acid and
[SPEAKER_01]: catechin that decreased respiration,
because I'm going to further study them in
[SPEAKER_01]: my next experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall, from this first experiment,
I can conclude that roots exude a large
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of phenolic compounds and that
these phenolic profiles are quite unique
[SPEAKER_01]: to one species, and that these compounds
can result in a variety of effects on soil
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are also still a lot of
unknowns or some unknowns that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first was, well, okay,
so we have this total flux of CO2 coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from the system, but what part of this
flux is coming or which part of this
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon is coming from the exudate or which
part of the carbon came from the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also, I still don't know really how
these microbials responded to the exudates
[SPEAKER_01]: that were added, and so what the mechanism
really was by which they degraded more or
[SPEAKER_01]: less soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, and this is just in
general a problem with studying the effect
[SPEAKER_01]: of root exudates in the way that I did and
that other studies did, is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: always just adding one compound to the
soil while roots exudes so many compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether the individual effect of one
root exudate is going to be the same when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a bunch of compounds added is also
still an open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this second experiment,
I collaborated with a lot of people to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer these remaining questions,
and I first want to thank Juana
[SPEAKER_01]: Munoz-Ucos.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it hadn't been for her, I wouldn't have
included a sequencing component into this
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for all your help and
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to thank JetSparks,
which helped me a lot with figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: the methods to use stable isotope analyses
to distinguish between the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: exudate source of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to thank Kim Sparks and
just COIL in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I also want to thank Kyle Wickens,
who helped me with the design of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment, enzyme analysis, microbial
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to thank his graduate student,
Natalie Bray, because she was the one who
[SPEAKER_01]: teached me or showed me how to use the TOC
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks a lot for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, I want to thank Roland
Wilhelm from the Buckley Lab, who helped,
[SPEAKER_01]: further supported me and Juana with the
sequencing part of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this soil exudate incubation
was similar to the incubation that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: in the previous study, only that this
incubation took longer, so it was 38 days
[SPEAKER_01]: in total, and that I used 13C labeled
compounds so that I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguish between carbon coming from
soil and carbon coming from the exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used two different methods to
measure soil respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still use my KOH traps to get an
estimate of the total amount or cumulative
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of carbon respired over the course
of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also, on several days, on day one,
day two, day five, day 15, and the last
[SPEAKER_01]: day of the experiment, I also took two
hour interval gas samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through using keeling plots,
I could estimate the delta frequency
[SPEAKER_01]: signature of the source of carbon being
respired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, to get more of this
microbial mechanism that could maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: explain part of these patterns that we
were seeing, I took a destructive sample
[SPEAKER_01]: on day five, day 15, and at the end for
the enzyme analysis for microbial biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial abundance, and then also for
sequencing part, or the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: community analysis of the study.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and then the last thing that I
want to mention about, or that was
[SPEAKER_01]: different from the last study,
is that I introduced glucose into the
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I chose glucose because that's the
compound that has been mode-wise this
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to see if its effect would be
the same when a compound, a phenolic
[SPEAKER_01]: compound was added at the same time that I
already showed has these different effects
[SPEAKER_01]: on soil microbial respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had treatments where I added just the
phenolic, add the glucose, or I added the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic and glucose together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the cases where there was just a
single compound, those were, so the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic was labeled, or the glucose was
labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the case where I added both
compounds, the glucose was labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't, I didn't have a way,
well, so I could distinguish between the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon coming from the glucose and from
the phenolic and the soil together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did estimate the amount of carbon that
came from the soil by subtracting the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of phenolic compound degraded in
the individual treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here are the chemicals that
I already introduced from my previous
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tested the effect of benzoic acid,
cafeic acid, and catechin at a high and a
[SPEAKER_01]: low dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then glucose, and so then I ended up with
14 treatments in total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the destructive samples that
I was taking at these different time
[SPEAKER_01]: points, I ended up with a lot of jars in a
growth chamber at Gooderman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, a lot of jars and also a lot
of results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the sake of this talk,
I'm gonna focus on these three points that
[SPEAKER_01]: I already mentioned that I was interested
in learning more about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you wanna learn even more about it,
then maybe tomorrow we can talk about it
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this first question of
where, to what extent are these root
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates actually degraded?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm showing you a graph here of the
degradation of the individual treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: or the individual compounds over the first
15 days of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: first let's look at glucose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the black line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see that on day one,
it's degraded to the highest degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it already very quickly drops and
by day 15, it's similar to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not being degraded much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for benzoic acid, we do see some
degradation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this just goes a little slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes against my hypothesis that these
phenolics aren't degraded at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are utilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if you look at cafeic acid and
catechins, they are almost not degraded or
[SPEAKER_01]: not degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is in line with what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we look at the amount of carbon
that is respired from the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: so this is over 38 days of the experiment,
we see that only, so the control here is
[SPEAKER_01]: in gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that only glucose increases
decomposition, soil organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposition and benzoic acid at the high
dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because I only picked up on this
effect or a difference in soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter decomposition for benzoic acid and
glucose, I'm gonna show you a graph of
[SPEAKER_01]: just those two treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the same as what I showed you
in the previous graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what I was interested in is this
interactive effect of benzoic acid and
[SPEAKER_01]: glucose on the breakdown of soil organic
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we see is that when they're
added together, the amount of soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that is decomposed is increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is actually more than if you
would just add their effects of the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can use enzyme analysis to get a
better idea of what kind of carbon sources
[SPEAKER_01]: were degraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found no difference in
phenoxidase or peroxidase activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did find a big increase in embedded
glucosidase activity in the benzoic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments and in the benzoic acid and
glucose treatments, which suggests that
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon sources that were utilized were
on the more label side and not very
[SPEAKER_01]: complex or aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then for the microbial mechanisms
that I was interested in studying,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to quickly elaborate on that
before moving into the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question that I was interested in
is to what extent a change in microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration is linked to an increase or
decrease in microbial abundance or
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question that I was interested in
was to what extent a change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial community or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine your control where no
phenolic compound is added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do add a phenolic
compound, but we don't see a change in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance and we don't see a change in the
community, then maybe the mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: involved is triggering mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the metabolism of the microbes that are
living in that soil is triggered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason why we see,
in this case, I'm using an increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration as my example, but you could
argue the same thing for a decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if we don't see a change in the
community, but we do see a change in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance, then maybe it's this increase
in microbial biomass that is linked with
[SPEAKER_01]: this increase in respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if we don't see a increase in
abundance, but we do see a shift in the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, then maybe it's this change in
the community that is linked to a change
[SPEAKER_01]: in respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a community that is maybe more actively
degrading carbon resources, or even maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a community that consists of more
degraders of soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start with showing you a graph of
microbial abundance as affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenolic treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have benzoic acid, cafeic acid,
and catechin, and the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that even though benzoic acid
increased microbial respiration overall,
[SPEAKER_01]: its abundance is not increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we look at cafeic acid and
catechin, we do see a decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these treatments were also the one
that were showing more of a decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in this case, abundance could
explain part of the story, but not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: case of benzoic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And
[SPEAKER_01]: so here are my microbial community
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a similar plot that I
showed as to the one with the root exudate
[SPEAKER_01]: variation among three species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, like points that are closer
together are more similar, and then points
[SPEAKER_01]: that are further apart are more different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are samples taken at day 05,
15, and 38.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that stands out is that
the microbial community changed over time
[SPEAKER_01]: because we see this shift with the days,
or days are grouped together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the thing that I was more
interested in seeing is what these
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic compounds were doing to the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see that benzoic acid,
so those are the data points in blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: are very far shifted away from the control
that is in gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though if you look at glucose,
which is in black, it's very closely
[SPEAKER_01]: grouped together through this control,
especially on day 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this suggests that even though glucose
and benzoic acid were both increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration, that maybe the mechanism by
which they did this was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so overall, like with these two
graphs, I've already tested the effect of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenolic compounds on abundance and on the
microbial community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can further test this by using
spearmint correlations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the unit that I used here for the
shift in microbial community is that I
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated the distance from these
individual data points to the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is kind of my measure for the
shift in the community that took place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we find, if you look at graph
A, that there was a significant
[SPEAKER_01]: correlation between the shift in the
community and the change in microbial
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we
[SPEAKER_01]: see a shift in the community, but what is
really changing or who is changing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that in the benzoic acid
treatment, the broke-holderia and
[SPEAKER_01]: parabolic-holderia genera, which
ecologically are kind of still treated as
[SPEAKER_01]: the same genus, even though
phylogenetically they have been separated
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, that they were the ones that
showed the greatest increase in abundance
[SPEAKER_01]: under the benzoic acid treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these genera are known to be prevalent
in forest soils, which was the soil that I
[SPEAKER_01]: used for both incubation studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also known to be able to
degrade phenolics quite efficiently and
[SPEAKER_01]: also be able to tolerate their toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, they also play a
role in soil organic matter decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can start seeing that this
mechanism that maybe with the addition of
[SPEAKER_01]: benzoic acid, we selected for microbial
genera that could degrade these compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: that could tolerate potential toxicity,
but that were also quite efficient at
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though benzoic acid also was used
as a food source and also increased
[SPEAKER_01]: respiration, I think that the mechanism by
which it was done was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it caused a change in the microbial
community, and that was what was more
[SPEAKER_01]: linked to this change in respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then to bring it back to my overall
hypothesis that I was testing in these two
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are phenolics used as a microbial food
source?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, in the case of benzoic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, in the case of catigan and cafeic
acid, or to a lesser degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mechanism by which this food
source was in the end causing also a
[SPEAKER_01]: change in organic matter decomposition was
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was changing the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so other phenolic mechanisms that
maybe I found some evidence for were
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicity in the case of cafeic acid and
catigan, because we saw this decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other mechanisms that my
results don't exclude, but that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: need further evidence for to support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings me to the end of my talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I shared my results today.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, about the responses of fine roots to
droughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then secondly, the mechanisms by which
root exudates can influence soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I answered some questions,
but there's still a lot of remaining
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very complex system to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope that you agree with me that
answering these remaining questions is
[SPEAKER_01]: worth the struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, I want to thank many
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, my major advice is Karen
Bauerly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for all your support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed working with you and
very much appreciated the freedom and
[SPEAKER_01]: confidence and tools you gave me to
develop my dissertation project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to thank the rest of my
committee, Tim, Andre, Jed, and Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really a pleasure to work with
all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I've learned a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very grateful for discussing my
results with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manuscript revisions help with research
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm just gonna keep on going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank all the members of
the Bauerly lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juana, who was also a collaborator,
and Annika, and all the undergraduates
[SPEAKER_01]: that helped me last time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also like to thank my other collaborators,
Mark, Hubel, Forsengram, Karen Fritz,
[SPEAKER_01]: that were involved in the Germany study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Juana and Roli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also Cornell's just great for,
they have so many facilities and the
[SPEAKER_01]: technical help and support that analytical
support I've received has just been
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank everyone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the wider CIPS community,
Johanna is my master's advisor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Bob Surgeon, who I TA'd for for many
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and the horticulture staff,
and also my funding sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, my family and friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have been, yeah, just wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really don't know how I would have
done it without all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially my friends here, Annika and my
boyfriend, who is now with me in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question to the first section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that your hypothesis was
confirmed about resource use efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: and complementary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's a hypothesis, because I
guess you didn't measure root
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have some above ground measurements
that really it did?
[SPEAKER_02]: The complementarity did not decrease CO2
uptake during drought, and did indeed also
[SPEAKER_02]: increase growth above ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other collaborators that are part of
this study are measuring the above ground
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, we found that drought is
decreasing carbon uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of the complementary part,
they haven't found, well, they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: published their results yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their results aren't super convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the effect of drought is
slightly mitigated, but it isn't super
[SPEAKER_01]: convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, there's other part of the
study is that there is this, so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this one big controlled fruitful exclusion
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also a larger gradient of
precipitation gradient where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at mainly above ground parameters
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some of these studies, they have
found this complementary effect above
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, but not at the Kranzberg sites
where I was working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, whatever it is, it could be
interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be more interesting if above
ground, there's no difference,
[SPEAKER_02]: no mitigation of the drought effect here
due to mixed systems and you find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: True.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be actually more interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's hope they don't find anything
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We must be through the last mixtures,
speech mixture studies outside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: drought world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have those found consistent mixture
effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not completely consistent, but there are
studies that show that there is a
[SPEAKER_01]: complementary effect and that there is
greater growth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How close those trees have to be to have
that complementary effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a few meters, so like maybe
two, three meters.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how a root will, I don't even
know how to ask this question,
[SPEAKER_03]: or how a tree modifies anatomically those
fine roots that they live on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how that lifespan is
controlled?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess I can hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say they try to maintain the root
for longer, because it's kind of this
[SPEAKER_01]: question of are you going to shed your
root?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you going to maintain it for longer
and just keep on sending resources its
[SPEAKER_01]: way?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there is something anatomically
that changes so that you have like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: root that can live a little longer,
I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Alex's results inform that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't he do stuff on carbon pollution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Alex's results in terms of the
lifespan or the?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so he found the relationship between
lifespan and respiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I think the roots with longer
lifespan had lower respiration rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

Thank you.
