[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the last time I stood up here,
the podium was over there, and I was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: my PhD defense seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine that, 23, 24 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a pleasure to be back and to be in
this position now as a full professor at
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Greg said, I got my master's and my PhD
here in Cornell in vegetable science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I, interestingly enough,
find myself as the program leader for
[SPEAKER_03]: cider research at Washington State
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So watch out, all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what happened to me was I
was moved up to the Northwest Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: Research Center in 2007, and I was the
sole horticulturalist there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was a program there on tree
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was asked to lead the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were research associates.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the whole program was being run
until in 2009, when all those positions
[SPEAKER_03]: were eliminated, because Washington State
went through some pretty severe budget
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts, as did the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I lost all the staff, and then it
became me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to make some decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was going to do with an entire tree
fruit program and I had a full vegetable
[SPEAKER_03]: program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had two full programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I systematically started to eliminate
the tree fruit program, because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: operate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had to make some strategic choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could eliminate this program or I
could keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that I kept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just give you an introduction to
[SPEAKER_03]: what the program is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go into any one aspect in
depth, but I'm just going to really
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce you to it and to the scope of
what we're trying to do at Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: State.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as Greg said, I'm at the Research
Center up in Mount Vernon, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: halfway between Seattle, Washington,
and Vancouver, BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're right on the Salish Sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're three miles from the sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the mountains on our back and
the Pacific Ocean just buffered from us by
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a challenge to grow apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not in the Yakima Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll show you the state here in a
little bit to get you oriented.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just a really brief introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure most of you know this about
cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to make sure we're all on
the same page.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk cider, we mean hard cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard cider is alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_03]: By law, it contains up to 8.5% alcohol by
volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the new law in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go above that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you fall into a different tax
bracket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes it more challenging to be
profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by law, it's 8.5% alcohol by volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2016, there were 575 commercial
cideries in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: producing over 2,000 distinctly different
ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cizer, which is a honey blend,
apple wines, and specialty ciders,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what I work with and Dr. Peck
works with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specialty ciders are made from specialty
cider apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what gives us the high quality
craft cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the picture on the left, I don't know
if you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I took that in New York City on
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Hudson Valley Hard Cider
Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's farmers market ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the ciders in wine bottles that
are $16, $30 a bottle for hard cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really hard to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the Seattle Sounders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody knows football
teams in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Seattle Sounders is our big Northwest
Seattle soccer team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's cider commercial at the
Sounders game a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cider is really big on the West Coast,
certainly, in Seattle, Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just looking a little bit at the
market here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just kind of giving you some background
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I realize it's not so easy to
see the numbers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here is Washington right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have the 16 data to put this
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: 52 ciders, cideries in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And New York has 65 as of 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: So New York definitely has more ciders
than cideries, that is places producing
[SPEAKER_03]: cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Washington, I think, has more volume
in terms of production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly in terms of apple
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at consumption,
so this is the top 10 cider markets by
[SPEAKER_03]: volume, LA, California being the number
one consuming location in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, Seattle right there behind it,
and Portland, Oregon just south of us is
[SPEAKER_03]: number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the number two and number three
markets in the United States for cider
[SPEAKER_03]: where I'm located in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can look down the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see New York there is number 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at cider in the United States,
we're really talking about two very
[SPEAKER_03]: different industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the volume of cider,
most of it is the mass market Angry
[SPEAKER_03]: Orchard, which is essentially coming out
of the Northeast United States here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took that photo there, that top left
photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took that out of my local food co-op in
Mount Vernon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was early morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on my way out of town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the Angry Orchard truck at the
local food market stocking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stopped and took that photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really hard to see here on the
left.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if you can see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is Crispin, which is another mass
marketed cider on tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly in Washington and Portland,
Oregon and those areas, you'll find cider
[SPEAKER_03]: on tap in a lot of mainstream bars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of nothing special.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a tap house by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go to Applebee's, there'll be cider
on tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the mainstream eateries will have
cider on tap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of shows you what kind of a
market we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a draft beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the right here, you can see
this is more what I work with and what Dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peck works with.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the craft market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this photo, I took it when we were in
Virginia a few years ago, where Dr. Peck
[SPEAKER_03]: hosted a meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are Virginia cideries,
Albemarle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Crispin is out of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a local Washington heirloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cider coming out of Seattle,
where basically every label is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every year is a different blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very niche market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Chelan Gold here, you can see
it's reduced down to $10.49 a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's our craft market in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of gives you an idea of what we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at specialty cider apples,
what makes them different from dessert
[SPEAKER_03]: apples, basically it's the high tannin
content along with high sugars.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sugars give the fermented alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tannins give the complex flavors,
the body, astringency, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dessert apples tend to be thinner and more
bland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're very readily available
certainly across the United States and for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Washington, as you may know,
it produces a lot of apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a lot of apple juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very available to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the cider makers are blending
the specialty apples along with the
[SPEAKER_03]: dessert apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really right now, we don't have enough
specialty apples in the United States to
[SPEAKER_03]: meet the demands for this emerging
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just kind of gives you an idea
what some of the fruit looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like apples, tend to be maybe a
little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see that the outward appearance
doesn't matter because it's just going
[SPEAKER_03]: straight to crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether or not it's got a little bit of
scab, et cetera, it's just not an issue
[SPEAKER_03]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cider apples in general break down into
four categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Long Ashton classification for
apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharp and sweet are the ones that you're
used to eating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are culinary apples, dessert
apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tannin, everything's divided out
by tannin and acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So less than 2% tannin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a sharp or a sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the high acid is going to be
greater than 0.45.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a sharp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And below that is a sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bitter sharps and the bitter
sweets are what we think of as specialty
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's that bitterness, that high tannin
is what gives the fermented juice its
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at where we are in Washington,
I wasn't sure how many of you might know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that red dot is the Northwest
Washington Research Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see we're pretty much
diametrically opposed across the country
[SPEAKER_03]: from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can also see that we're really far
north.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're as far north as Newfoundland,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know how many of you realize
that, how far north we are in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that red star is where I'm at the
Northwest Washington Research Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you think of Washington apples,
you're thinking of the Yakima Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is right here, Wenatchee,
which is right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sits on the east side of the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in that rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dry, really high quality apple
production, high volume.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're over here right next to the
Salish Sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Puget Sound area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maritime, cool, think disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think New York without the cold winters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything overwinters really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a good thing, necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look at where cider apples
come from, historically, they come from a
[SPEAKER_03]: climate not too different from Western
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the program started in Western
Washington, and it's still there under my
[SPEAKER_03]: management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my program, this is just a checklist of
the things that we're doing in my program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to run through some of this in
some detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it we're just going to touch on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that we've been
doing is we've been evaluating cider apple
[SPEAKER_03]: juice, so characterizing the varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making single varietal ciders,
and then we characterize those.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make four to five a year, and we
characterize those through a process I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We completed a study last year where we
compared juice quality of four varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: grown at four Washington locations,
trying to look at that genetics times
[SPEAKER_03]: environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We measuring the cost of cider apple
orchard establishment, and we're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that for mechanical harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're evaluating mechanical harvest,
working with the industry to develop a
[SPEAKER_03]: harvester for cider apples, developing
planting guidelines for orchard
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanization, developing management
strategies for apple anthracnose canker.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is our main disease in Western
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cool, humid climate that is year
round.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really creates this issue for us where
the hot spot in the world goes from
[SPEAKER_03]: Vancouver, Canada down through Portland,
Oregon, now down a little bit into the
[SPEAKER_03]: Willamette, and then I've heard reports in
Northern California as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a problem on the trees as it
is in our area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we do a lot of work on providing
cider education workshops, and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: started doing online training videos a
while ago to try to back all this up as
[SPEAKER_03]: people were looking for continuing
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just a really quick overview of
my program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do all of this with absolutely no
background or training in tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, for those of you who are in
graduate school, just be aware that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can, you know, you never know what you're
going to be asked to do, and then you just
[SPEAKER_03]: do the best you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you call on your friends and
former graduate students, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they become the national experts,
and they help you out along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the history of cider apple orchards at
Washington State University at the Mount
[SPEAKER_03]: Vernon Research Center, the first trees
were planted in 1979, six varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1983 to 1994, 20 more varieties were
added.
[SPEAKER_03]: 94, 70 more varieties were added.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2002 to currently, what we're doing
is we're actually focusing on data
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all those trees were planted,
but there wasn't a lot of data collected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more observational, and there's
really, there's no records really to go
[SPEAKER_03]: back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I came in, we started digging out
the records.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made the staff start to write reports
and start to say, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not good enough just to say we got
orchards out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to actually produce some data and
some results from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in 2014, we started planting our
first replicated variety trial with 65
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apple varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've completed that planting as of
last year, and hopefully next year,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll start with our harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at cider apple orchards in
Washington, this is our largest grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Craig Campbell from Tyeton Cider
Works, and that is his, was his new
[SPEAKER_03]: planting a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are cider apple orchards,
and this is the Washington apple industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the most part, without the T trellis
or the V trellis or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the complicated trellising system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just using a tall spindle type
of system for cider apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is what a new planting looks
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is his old established planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, I don't know if you're familiar
with these planting systems, but for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apples, you just, you're not looking
at that every fruit perfect quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just getting the maximum number of
fruit with the cannons in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't really know what any of that
looks like because nobody's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: investigated the orcharding systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Peck is probably one of the first
people to start to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a lot of time for all of you
in tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it takes a lot of time from
inception to, or conception to inception
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually publishing any data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it's a 10 year program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the orchards that I inherited
this photo here on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what, you know, basically they
were just a collection of I think by this
[SPEAKER_03]: time we had about 90 some varieties in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what we've been using for our
research orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's Travis Alexander, one of my PhD
students harvesting our apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the data that I'm going to start to
show you just comes from our old orchards
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, because our new orchards will
just start to start being productive in
[SPEAKER_03]: the next year or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we collect the fruit from each tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, first on off, we assess maturity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're harvesting our cider apples at full
maturity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking for full tannin, full sugars on
the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a dessert apple is harvested at a four
or a five.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're harvesting at an eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going for full maturity on the tree
coming out of the orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we, everything is done by variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: We clean our equipment between every
single sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking down, washing out, it takes a
long time to go through all these samples,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can appreciate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my grinder shredder on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use an old bladder press, because I
inherited from the wine grape program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what we use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then getting our juice samples out for
our analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things we have in press
right now is Hort technology, where we're
[SPEAKER_03]: publishing 20 some varieties, where we've
done the phenology on the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at days to maturity,
bloom density, fruit density, orchard,
[SPEAKER_03]: some other orchard observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've measured, harvested the
fruit looking at fruit size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the tannins, titratable acidity,
bricks, and pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this ultimately is what the cider
makers want to know, is these types of
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have an article coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be published in
June, but it's in press right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: summarizing about 20 some of the first set
of varieties that we have, complete data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by complete data, I mean up to 15
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we only have single trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to have a certain amount of
assurance that our data was pretty solid
[SPEAKER_03]: before we tried to publish it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go through any of
these details other than to tell you that
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things we found is that our
tannins, and remember, again, a specialty
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apples are separated from culinary
apples almost predominantly by tannins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're finding is that there's a
location effect on tannins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of our varieties are not testing
at the same tannin level as they tested in
[SPEAKER_03]: England, where they were evaluated back in
the early 1900s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think the reason for that might
just be because of production practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in England, going back into the early
1900s, they weren't fertilizing their
[SPEAKER_03]: trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't irrigating their trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming into our modern orchards,
they're highly maintained.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're well irrigated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're well fertilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sprayed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of management going
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think that that might be
influencing the tannin content there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a stress tree might be having a higher
tannin level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something to think about, and certainly
something as a research scientist you
[SPEAKER_03]: might want to know, if you really want
high tannin levels, then maybe you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you don't want to be irrigating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to be changing your
management system to get the qualities you
[SPEAKER_03]: want for tannin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that if you look at the
standard deviation, so just take the first
[SPEAKER_03]: one, for example, Amer de Berthcore,
you can see that the mean is 0.48 and the
[SPEAKER_03]: standard deviation is 0.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's three years of data there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The standard deviation is very high for
tannin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means that every year can be
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every year you can get a swing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're banking on this crop,
you have to measure every year what your
[SPEAKER_03]: juice levels are, because then you have to
manage your cider accordingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So standard deviation on tannins we found
over the 15 years of data that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: collected can be quite significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cider characterization, what we do is
we make varietal ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the capacity to harvest a
variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we ferment that variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have it characterized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first varietal ciders were made at
our research center back in 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2003, we started training panels in our
region through the cider school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have the cider school here in New
York.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up at the Geneva station.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started about the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Mitchell is the instructor who came
over from England to teach that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2009, we published our first manual,
Production Orchard Management in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Pacific Northwest, where we include all
the juice data that I showed you up to
[SPEAKER_03]: that point in time, plus the varietal
cider data that we had up until that point
[SPEAKER_03]: in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been continuing on with those
varietal ciders since 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: Each year, we try to evaluate three to
four different varietals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see our WSU label right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we label everything with the year,
the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have a pretty standard process by
which we make those ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you can see this is Gary Moulton,
who was the research associate when I
[SPEAKER_03]: inherited the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's pitching the yeast into the
carboy there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use a champagne yeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we keep the same yeast for every single
batch, because you have to have some
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency when you're making these
comparisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use the same yeast batch,
or the same yeast for every batch that we
[SPEAKER_03]: make.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have a fermentation room in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a really fancy word for a
closet with an air conditioning system in
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is where we do all our
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we keep the temperature, and all the
bottles are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is our bottler.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Drew Zimmerman, who is a private
cider maker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been working with us with the
program since 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went over to England back in 2002,
met Peter Mitchell, and got Peter Mitchell
[SPEAKER_03]: to come to the United States to start
teaching cider school.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been extremely lucky to have this
partnership with a commercial cider maker
[SPEAKER_03]: who trains my staff, trains my students,
just works with us hand in hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as with the students who come
through the school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we bottle everything and keep it
stored in our store room there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our cold room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a four-year policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once something is more than four years
old, so year five, we toss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because we think at that point it's
losing its quality, and any tasting
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't do it justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our panel is trained by Peter Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Peter Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I don't know how many of you are
familiar with cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if this name means
anything to you or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any familiarity with cider,
then you know that Peter Mitchell is the
[SPEAKER_03]: father of cider quality evaluation in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he really started the program or
was really influential in the program in
[SPEAKER_03]: England.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with a trained panel that was
trained by Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Drew Zimmerman goes through and
makes sure that everybody can give us
[SPEAKER_03]: really very quality evaluations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do multiple sessions, convenient
locations to the panel members,
[SPEAKER_03]: maximum of five ciders per session.
[SPEAKER_03]: One session per cider is adequate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found that more sessions don't really
give us any new information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, we don't have the capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the capacity to do more than
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with what we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just an example of what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, we went to Snowdrift Cider
in Wenatchee, May 24, 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had five evaluators there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ciders they evaluated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we went to Alpenfire in Port
Townsend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's over on the Olympic Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had seven evaluators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the ciders that they
evaluated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can just kind of get a sense for
what we try to do with our evaluators.
[SPEAKER_03]: The evaluators, these are cider makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're cider aficionados.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do this all and volunteer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't pay them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't pay their way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They meet us at the site wherever we're
going to meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bring all the ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do the tastings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a real methodical way that you
go through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do this all voluntarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way that they feel about it,
the way we feel about it, this serves the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry not only in Washington,
but nationally, because there are no
[SPEAKER_03]: evaluations for these single-varietal
ciders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that I started in
the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I brought this concept into the
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we've been building on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we have these evaluation results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a snapshot where we have
a description.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it follows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the score sheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it follows the score sheet that Peter
Mitchell uses to train cider evaluators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we follow the training that is used now
by the National Institute Cider Institute
[SPEAKER_03]: in North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's used through the European system
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the cider core.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to move on to orchard
establishment costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another big part of the program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, when I started getting involved
with cider apples, one of the big
[SPEAKER_03]: questions that everybody asks is,
well, can you make money?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK, you can make money selling
a bottle of cider, assuming it's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you make money growing the apples?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are a pretty significant apple
industry and trying to convince dessert
[SPEAKER_03]: apple growers to grow a cider apple when
the value of a cider apple is so much less
[SPEAKER_03]: than a dessert apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not happening very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we realized pretty early on that we
really had to do a lot of work with the
[SPEAKER_03]: economics, trying to understand what the
costs were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to go through a snapshot
of one of these budgets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the three budgets we've
published.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is cost estimation of
establishing an orchard in Western
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington, cost estimation in Central
Washington, and then we've done a
[SPEAKER_03]: feasibility of different harvest methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what that means is hand and
mechanization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cider apples lend themselves extremely
well to mechanized production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll show you how.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you some photos here of the work
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But mechanized harvest, mechanized
pruning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think that that can lower costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But until we actually have orchards to
work with to understand really what the
[SPEAKER_03]: costs are, we can't really show that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're right on the verge of doing that
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a snapshot scenario of
what it takes to write a production
[SPEAKER_03]: budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'm not an economist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work with an economist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suzette Gallinato is the person I work
with at Washington State.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my job to come up with a scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my job to say what's going to be most
meaningful to the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what are all these assumptions
that one has to basically assume is your
[SPEAKER_03]: starting point, your benchmark for
starting to determine what a cider apple
[SPEAKER_03]: orchard is going to look like and what the
costs are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we said, OK, let's start with a 10 acre
orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Western Washington, we don't have any
apple orchards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody's going to get into cider
apples, we think 10 acres is probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable number of acres that they're
going to start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of that 10 acres, only 9 acres are
actually orchards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got roadways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got headlands, all these other
things that take up land.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've only really got nine productive
acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: Central leader system, we assumed a dwarf
M9 series rootstock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our cider apple growers have mixed
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have any one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we assume the mix that we have in our
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We assume the in-row spacing, between-row
spacing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should say, this is all based on us
going out and interviewing every cider
[SPEAKER_03]: apple grower in Western Washington that
would sit down and work with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the assumptions we made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started to calculate the
returns.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the cost of actually
establishing that orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see in year one, it's a $10,000
enterprise just putting that orchard in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't account for the cost of
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our land is $14,000 an acre right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: For farmland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you actually wanted to do this,
on top of that cost, you'd be paying
[SPEAKER_03]: $14,000 an acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is why we don't have a lot of crop
production in an area, because we grow
[SPEAKER_03]: houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're outside of New York City,
you know exactly what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in any developing area where the
cost of, or the returns for housing is
[SPEAKER_03]: more than the return for farming,
that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, here we are with costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, once we get into full
production, sorry, you can see here,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're starting to return about
$1,500 an acre year five onwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So indeed, cider apple production is
profitable in Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's profitable in Eastern Washington,
assuming all those assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Eastern Washington, what we said was,
instead of being a standalone 10 acre
[SPEAKER_03]: orchard, it's a 10 acre block within a 100
acre orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of our orchards are several
hundred acres in Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody's gonna just go and put in a 10
acre orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're already gonna have, you know,
100, 200, 1,000 acres, and maybe they're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna put one block, 10 acre block,
into cider apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there, in Eastern Washington,
we went along that assumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to set your assumptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to know what you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to talk with your growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of legwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of sitting down with growers
who can give you the numbers to the best
[SPEAKER_03]: of their abilities, and be as honest with
you as they can, because not everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: likes to tell you what their costs and
profits are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just, you have to trust them,
and they have to trust you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just, it takes a while to get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what we did is we do these profit
analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We say, okay, well, you can't guarantee
the yield every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't guarantee your price every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what could that look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talk in bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk in bushels.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 40 pounds a bushel for apples,
40 pounds a bushel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can do the math on that,
but basically what you can see here is
[SPEAKER_03]: that $300 a bin, and that is 33 cents a
pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we did these numbers a couple of
years ago, the bottom price our growers
[SPEAKER_03]: were getting were 35 cents a pound for
cider apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 33 cents was under the bottom price
that our cider apple growers were getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And good yielding, like the high yielding
cider orchards in our area are 60 to 70
[SPEAKER_03]: bins per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are bins per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to be above this,
but I wanted to be very conservative,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I didn't want to, you know,
you don't want to give people the best of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best, and they're not as good as you
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they might be, or they think
they might be, and then they get pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: angry with you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you be really conservative with your
numbers, be conservative with your yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: be conservative with your price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you can see here is the light
blue shades are profits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once you get up to 40 bins and,
you know, 38 cents a pound is right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're earning $1,200 an acre
from cider apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's assuming all those other costs
that all go into the production model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this just gives growers an
opportunity to see what their production
[SPEAKER_03]: potentials are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, cider apples in Washington,
as of 2016, the end of 2016, sold for
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere from, oh, I'm trying to think,
the average price was about 45 cents a
[SPEAKER_03]: pound, and it went up to about 75 cents a
pound on average, but you have some people
[SPEAKER_03]: paying $1.20 for particular varieties,
but that's a, you know, Kingston black,
[SPEAKER_03]: very particular label, somebody who's
going for a Kingston black label.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on average, it's about 45 cents a
pound, 75, you know, on average,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the top mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially, cider apples have the
opportunity to really be quite profitable,
[SPEAKER_03]: assuming, of course, you can do your
yields, which comes back to apple
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that moves me to the area that I've
really focused quite a bit on my program,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is mechanical harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it became pretty evident to me,
and I don't know anything about apples,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it became pretty evident to me when I
walked out of the orchard that there might
[SPEAKER_03]: be a better way to do this in hand
harvesting, especially when we are in an
[SPEAKER_03]: area where we don't have orchards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have orchards,
you don't have labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have labor, you're
spending a lot more money to get your
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit off the trees than you would in an
area that has orchards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our prices, our land prices are high,
our labor prices are high, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the whole scenario just kind of
works against you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started looking at mechanical
harvest, and I should also say that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: a leading national producer of blueberries
and raspberries, which are mechanically
[SPEAKER_03]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have these over-the-roll
harvesters, which we happen to own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a site or planting that was
planted very specifically to test this
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the mechanization, understand,
was built for bushes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we planted our trees at the same height
as a bush with the idea that we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: testing a concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hand harvest accounts for 38 to 46 percent
of your budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can reduce that, you have a
significant impact on your production
[SPEAKER_03]: budgets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mechanized harvest is used for cider
apples throughout Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's essentially no hand harvest in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using a shake and sweep harvest
system, which I'll show you here,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are not, it's not suitable,
I don't believe, for our modern orchard
[SPEAKER_03]: systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington is a very modern apple orchard
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to go back to production
technology of 30, 40 years ago to grow a
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order for us to look ahead and say,
okay, well, what are your orchard systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what kind of machinery can fit the
modern orchard system, we have to look
[SPEAKER_03]: forward, not backward.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been my stance, and I'll tell you,
I've taken a lot of flack for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Washington cider industry is
looking to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that's not what Europe does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the things you have to learn
as a research scientist, and I'm an
[SPEAKER_03]: extension specialist, is you have to take
a lot of flack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe in 10 years, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they'll say, oh, good thing
somebody did that work, and they won't
[SPEAKER_03]: remember who it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, hopefully it'll be you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully you'll know that you were
moving in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what our mechanical harvesters
look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is harvesting our cider apples at the
Mount Vernon Research Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a small fruit harvester built for
raspberries and blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we built our cider apples to fit
under the harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: So understand and recognize that this is
not what I'm recommending a cider orchard
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that this is how we had to grow our
cider apple trees to fit the harvester
[SPEAKER_03]: that we owned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I actually think you could probably
do this pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could grow a dwarf apple tree,
which is what we're doing, and fit this
[SPEAKER_03]: machinery, which is readily available
across the entire United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at any blueberry
industries, so Michigan, all the way down
[SPEAKER_03]: through Florida, they're all using
mechanical harvest, and they're using
[SPEAKER_03]: these harvesters.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of different
manufacturers, but it's all pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: the same technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could easily fit these machines
over these trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the things we've been
able to show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always have to say this is our proof
of concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying necessarily this is what
your cider apple orchard should be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to do something in order to
test this machinery when the machinery
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't exist, because you can't prove
there's a market for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a $350,000 piece of machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's chicken and egg, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're the Omelettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's looking in the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their fingers are rotating fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They vibrate, and they shake the fruit off
the trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the first things I had to do after,
so we ran the machinery over the first
[SPEAKER_03]: year, and I realized the trees weren't
designed correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next year, we redesigned the trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We loosened up the wires, because they
were really tight to the wire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was very planar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we've done is we've opened up
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it's going to about a foot on
each side of the wire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things are not tight on the wire.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be give, because in order for
the fruit to shake, the whole tree has to
[SPEAKER_03]: shake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I learned in year one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the big issue we have is this is
brown snout, which is a small,
[SPEAKER_03]: medium-sized fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't fit in the cups, because the
cups were built for blueberries and
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries, which are tiny, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thumb size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the apples don't fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are other things that need to be
done here to make this machinery fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If one wanted to, but the belts here are
made by the manufacturer, and they can
[SPEAKER_03]: simply cut out every other cup and make a
double-wide cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what the apples look like when
they come out of the harvester,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're going on the press line 100%
bruising.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did a couple of different
experiments, two-year experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year experiment, we took all
that fruit, and we have this all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hand harvest, we have machine
harvest, we have pressing at zero weeks at
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest, we have pressing two weeks
storage and pressing four weeks storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was under cold storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we found is that there was no
impact on juice quality with 100% bruised
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit going into cold storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then our growers said, well, we don't have
cold storage in Western Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an Eastern Washington thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when you barn store?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we barn store our fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just make piles, and then they walk
away, and then they come back and press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens if you use ambient
storage?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, OK, well, we'll look at that
next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a two-year study where we looked
at zero, two, and four weeks of ambient
[SPEAKER_03]: barn storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is some of that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first two years, 2011 and 2012,
are the cold stored fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not showing you the fruit quality
data, because there was no difference on
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit quality data for the storage time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want you to look at is I want you
to look at yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just looking at the harvest time,
hand versus machine, when we just took the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit that came out of the machine,
on average, for the four years,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had 63% pick efficiency, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really low.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we found is a lot of the fruit
was in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, hit the ground, because it
bounces off the machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hits the machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not raspberries and blueberries are
soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hit the bottom plate, and they just
roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apples bounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they bounce out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we theorize is if you put a net on
the front and the back, you'd keep all
[SPEAKER_03]: those fruit in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other big problem, 28% of the
fruit was stuck in the belts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those cups were really small.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fruit would just jam in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once you removed all of that fruit,
we were up to 94% picking efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there would have to be some mechanical
adjustment to get that picking rate up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we feel like that's very, very doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is looking at the ambient stored
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the cold stored fruit,
everything was statistically equivalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We essentially had no loss, a couple of
percent loss over time, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: negligible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here, when we looked at percent rot
two weeks and four weeks, hand versus
[SPEAKER_03]: machine, we had 22% loss at two weeks and
41% loss at four weeks, which is enormous
[SPEAKER_03]: and untenable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, the bottom line here is if
you're going to be using mechanical
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest, you can't store fruit under
ambient conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in Europe, where they use a system
which I'll show you here next,
[SPEAKER_03]: what they do is they press immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within 24 hours, all the fruit gets
pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Western Washington and other areas of
the United States, they like to do what's
[SPEAKER_03]: called sweating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think actually sweating is
necessary because if you pick the fruit at
[SPEAKER_03]: prime maturity, at peak maturity,
it's got the maximum sugars and the
[SPEAKER_03]: maximum tannins.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not increasing those by storing the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: All you're doing is condensing them
because you're losing moisture through
[SPEAKER_03]: sweating.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not increasing the levels per
se.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my feeling is that we have to get the
industry to change its mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is where they start throwing
tomatoes at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just takes time to do the data and
kind of show them what the production
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Travis, my PhD student.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did the previous work that I showed
you, as well as the work I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: show you, which is comparing the different
four locations in Washington, finding that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're actually, sorry, I should have
summarized those slides or that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did not see a difference in
varieties among our four locations in
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those varieties were staying pretty
equal based on across the four locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Travis is now moving forward in
his final year in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a picture of his PhD program
looking at sensory evaluation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a train panel and an electronic
tongue analysis last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's moving forward with
analytical chemistry analysis,
[SPEAKER_03]: looking more closely at the polyphenols of
some of the fruit, mechanically harvested
[SPEAKER_03]: and hand-harvested fruit, and working with
Dr. Carolyn Ross and Tom Collins at WSU
[SPEAKER_03]: Food Science Department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the harvest systems that I want
to show you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the English system on the left.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the way essentially all cider
apples in Europe are harvested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what I call the shake and sweep
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a hydraulics tree shaker shaking
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you've got the sweep system here
that comes behind like a golf ball shaker
[SPEAKER_03]: or a tennis ball or whatever, and gets all
that fruit and loads it up into the bin
[SPEAKER_03]: that's in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is what was the small fruit
harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're harvesting cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've made it 12 foot tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was the first time I was able to
look at it was last year harvesting
[SPEAKER_03]: cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the commercial production in
cherries in Washington state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kept all that information
proprietary for the first three years that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were working on it, because the
grower is paying for all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry doesn't pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grower pays for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're paying for the development,
the R&D out of their pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they weren't going to let anybody
else touch it until they tried it,
[SPEAKER_03]: worked it, got their money for the first
two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they're willing to share what
they've done with the harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creating the harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a master's project from my
program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holly Tennant, who's just graduating right
now, just finished her master's degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And her thesis is costing considerations
for establishing a cider apple orchard for
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanical harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we did is we compared,
in theory, what an orchard would look like
[SPEAKER_03]: for either one of those two systems in
Washington and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work with Washington and Oregon apple
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the shake and sweep harvest
system that the Oregon growers want to
[SPEAKER_03]: use.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a cable tree shaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon is a big nut industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hazelnuts are their big crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these tree shakers are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a cable that you hook up to
your tractor and PTO system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you shake that tree, and all the
nuts or the fruit fall to the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the harvester that they
were looking to bring in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Patent and Grouse
self-propelled harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it's a rather small piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's what they thought they wanted to
start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, that 10-acre orchard,
you wanted to be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the type of equipment that they
thought would be affordable to them as an
[SPEAKER_03]: individual-owned operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what they wanted us to cost
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So under that system, working again with
the growers, the cider apple growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the industry, trying to get all the
numbers in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purchasing that harvester is $49,745,
bringing it into the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's coming in from England.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cable tree shaker is $2,500.
[SPEAKER_03]: The import costs on the harvester are
$4,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shaker only shakes 20 trees per hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the harvester picks 70,000 pounds of
fruit per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are things for you to keep in
mind if you can do the math or if you
[SPEAKER_03]: care.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will all be published as well,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in these numbers,
you're more than welcome to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see, 389 trees per acre,
20 trees per hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the math for figuring out how
many hours it would take you to do an
[SPEAKER_03]: acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got nine acre productive acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 40-day operation or something to
shake the fruit off the trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the numbers are, it takes a lot
of time to use those shakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the growers hadn't thought about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the interesting thing about
working through numbers with growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: because all they see is $2,500 for a piece
of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, that's really
affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you say, OK, well, 20 trees an
hour, and you've got nine acres of trees,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you've got 389 trees per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many trees, how many days is that
going to take?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh, well, we can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK, well, maybe you need to go
to the next piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start to put the numbers onto paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: You start to pencil it all out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they start to look and try to get
a sense for how this is all going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to understand,
we're doing all of this with nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: actually doing any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all theories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's doing any of this harvesting in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can only theorize what all these
costs are going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least it gives a grower a good
place to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's our job as research scientists
is try to give you fact-based information
[SPEAKER_03]: to start So the yield on an orchard like
this, we are estimating at 147 pounds per
[SPEAKER_03]: tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that comes from my orchard in Mount
Vernon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at the size of the trees,
three varieties, four years of data that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have works out to be about 147 pounds
per tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the production level on this type of
orchard is about 57,000 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so looking at all the costs,
the profitability per acre for a full year
[SPEAKER_03]: of production, this is profitability
taking all your costs into account,
[SPEAKER_03]: including land, is $11,000 per acre.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make $11,000 an acre doing
this, but what it doesn't take into
[SPEAKER_03]: account is the fact that it's going to
take you 30 days to shake the trees and
[SPEAKER_03]: what might be happening with the fruit
quality over that period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take those kinds of issues into
account.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then this is the over-the-row tree
fruit harvester.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Oxbow model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxbow bought out our large Washington
industry, which was Corvan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxbow is out of the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been a lot of consolidation in
the mechanical harvest equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is harvesting olives in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the Littau Harvester,
which is an Oregon company harvesting
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet cherries in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what it looks like from the
front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can easily imagine that that's a
cider apple tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the same architecture, same size,
and I think that this could really work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at this piece of equipment,
it's $350,000 new, $5,000 annual
[SPEAKER_03]: maintenance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could lease it for $70,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after year five, you might as well
have paid for it, because the profit
[SPEAKER_03]: margin in buying the machine outright is
far better after five years than if you
[SPEAKER_03]: were leasing it every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pick speed, you're picking a bin every
10 to 12 minutes, one tree every 14
[SPEAKER_03]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're through that 10-acre orchard in a
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it starts so that when you've got a lot
and lots of acres, it starts to look
[SPEAKER_03]: really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go through this really
quickly, because I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: time left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the hedger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is looking at what we're
projecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cider apple orchard could look like in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've mechanized harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to mechanize harvest,
we think that you can easily mechanize
[SPEAKER_03]: pruning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the hedger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is hedging used in the Northeast for tree
fruit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this work that I'm familiar with
right here is out of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is John Clements out of
Massachusetts using the fruiting wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think that using a fruiting wall
system and the mechanical hedger and the
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanical harvester all could come
together really nicely for a mechanized
[SPEAKER_03]: cider apple orchard in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my last few slides here, and I'm going
to go quickly on this, is apple
[SPEAKER_03]: anthracnose canker, because I want to
introduce this to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that it's a problem here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't heard of any significant
reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we continue to have global warming,
and if your winters continue to get
[SPEAKER_03]: warmer, this is something you might see in
the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what the disease looks like on
the tree right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it looks like on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is bullseye rot on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's apple anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're probably familiar with it as
bullseye rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also causes this canker here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that canker will kill a new tree and
will limit production on an established
[SPEAKER_03]: tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my master's student Whitney
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And her work is in isolating and
inoculating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to replicate the infection pattern,
and then looking at management of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cankers, and looking at preventative as
well as curative control in fungicide
[SPEAKER_03]: trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go through this data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm certainly willing to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have this disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to worry about it,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the interesting things is after
we do all the control, and after she
[SPEAKER_03]: thinks she has control, she goes back 15
months after the initial applications,
[SPEAKER_03]: and she carves out the trees, and voila.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's disease within the tree itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you may topically treat it,
it looks like it's in the tree,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is still surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just found this about a month or so
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're trying to figure out what it
all means in terms of management.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of research support goes into all
of those experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a lot of funding from a lot of
people, and we're really appreciative of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it's a lot of people doing
the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's my team.
[SPEAKER_03]: My graduate students, Holly, Travis,
and Whitney, my staff, my research techs,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed and Jackie, and then Rebecca and
Catherine doing all the pruning,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the grunt work out in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have time for questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: One?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see a difference in profitability
between different hard center varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: just based on the different horticultural
traits?
[SPEAKER_03]: Popular?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the different cultivars that you were
using, did you see a difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: profitability based on the different,
you know, Groushstock versus Gavanet?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say so much, except for there
are a couple of recognized names,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Kingston Black.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so everybody thinks they want
Kingston Black, and they're willing to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: top dollar for Kingston Black.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably of all the specialty
varieties that we work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the one that has name
recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from that, they're really looking at
tannins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want to know which ones are going
to be bitter, and at what level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet more in terms of yield and being
able to harvest them, and in terms of how
[SPEAKER_01]: they perform horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, not, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I'm thinking profitability,
I'm thinking how much is a buyer willing
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to pay more for a top tannin
producer, Kingston Black.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to pay more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to offset your yield to a
certain extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on yield, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just starting to look at that yield
data right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, 15 years of data, just starting to
aggregate it all and start to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: which varieties might be more productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be quite honest, I mean,
I think Dr. Peck has the first research
[SPEAKER_03]: orchard where you can start to look at
yield data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have one tree per cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty, you're making a lot of
assumptions based on that one tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a little cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you paying attention to some apple
varieties that can give you a good
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatic character in the final cider
product?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say not at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my PhD student, Travis,
wants to look more at the polyphenol
[SPEAKER_03]: composition and start to look more at
chemical composition and the finished
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And understand the relationship with the
juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're just at the very beginning of
any of that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say I have not done it,
certainly have not done it to date.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as to whether or not we do it,
I don't know that we're going to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it, to be perfectly honest,
because we don't receive any funding for a
[SPEAKER_03]: hard cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: We receive funding for tree production,
fruit production, but not for a hard
[SPEAKER_03]: cider.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a really tight line that
you're walking as a research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jessica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Carol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
