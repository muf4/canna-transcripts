[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're going to shift now to the
presentation for our first speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Tracy Lusky received her PhD in
entomology from the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts at Amherst.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been employed as a research
entomologist for USDA ARS at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian Fruit Research Station in
Kernesville, West Virginia since 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research focuses on behavioral and
chemical ecology of economically important
[SPEAKER_01]: tree fruit pests and specifically on
developing behaviorally based monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: tools and management strategies for the
brown marmorated stink bug, plum curculio,
[SPEAKER_01]: apple maggot fly, and dogwood borer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, can you hear me Kathy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll go ahead then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so today I am going to talk about
brown marmorated stink bug and its
[SPEAKER_04]: emergence as a serious pest of agriculture
here in the Mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_04]: To begin with, brown marmorated stink bug
is considered an invasive species and it
[SPEAKER_04]: is native to China, Japan, Korea,
and Taiwan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's defined as an invasive species
because it has been introduced into an
[SPEAKER_04]: area for which it naturally does not
occur, in this case North America,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also because it threatens both
environmental and economic resources due
[SPEAKER_04]: to the damage it causes in this case to
agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a little bit about the identification
of brown marmorated stink bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't seen these insects yet,
the adults you'll see on the right hand
[SPEAKER_04]: side of the screen, the lower right,
with the male and the female, they have
[SPEAKER_04]: very prominent white stripes on their
antennae.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the small arrow that's
pointing at the left antenna of the male
[SPEAKER_04]: stink bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the outer edges of the abdomen there
are alternating patterns of white and dark
[SPEAKER_04]: markings, and this is actually why it is
referred to as the marmorated stink bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another term for describing that
appearance.
[SPEAKER_04]: The underside is generally pale with some
gray or black markings, and of course they
[SPEAKER_04]: emit a very pungent odor when disturbed,
hence they're called stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell you if you haven't smelled
it previously, it smells very different
[SPEAKER_04]: than our native species, and some people
often detect an odor of cilantro when they
[SPEAKER_04]: handle this bug, although it is much more
pungent than just the odor of cilantro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the eggs in the upper right hand
corner are barrel-straped.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're first laid, they're kind of
bright green, but they turn white.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, they're laid on the undersides
of leaves in masses, and there are
[SPEAKER_04]: typically 28 eggs per mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: The female lays eggs in intervals of
seven, typically.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nymphs, you see the first instar
nymphs there just below the eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nymphs typically, the first instars
will be near the hatched eggs,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they will remain there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The seconds through the fifths are very
mobile, and in fact they've been described
[SPEAKER_04]: as sort of tick-like when they're climbing
around on foliage, but you can see that
[SPEAKER_04]: they typically also have those white
stripes on the antennae, and again that's
[SPEAKER_04]: a good way to define if these are brown
marmorated stink bug nymphs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now a little bit about the history of
brown marmorated stink bug, and these
[SPEAKER_04]: comments are related principally to tree
fruit, because this is where we've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: the most injury, at least that we're most
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: This insect is thought to have been
introduced into the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere between the mid to late 1990s.
[SPEAKER_04]: It showed up in Allentown, Pennsylvania in
1998, but the first properly identified
[SPEAKER_04]: specimen didn't occur until 2001 when
specimens were sent by Karen Bernhard,
[SPEAKER_04]: who was with Penn State Cooperative
Extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: She sent those to Cornell to Rick Hoback,
who confirmed they were indeed brown
[SPEAKER_04]: marmorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: The following year in 2002, they were
confirmed in New Jersey, and then we
[SPEAKER_04]: confirmed their presence in Maryland and
Hagerstown in 2003.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found them in West Virginia in 2004,
and they continued to spread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there was a bit of a lag period
between those introductions and detections
[SPEAKER_04]: and serious injury, and in the eastern
panhandle of West Virginia, we actually
[SPEAKER_04]: did not see injury until 2008 when the
first reports of late season injury
[SPEAKER_04]: appeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then in 2009, we began to see both nymphs
and adults in orchards throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of the season, and there was very
serious injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then of course in 2010, this was really a
watershed year where we saw injury in tree
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit, small fruit, vegetables,
row crops, and in vineyards and throughout
[SPEAKER_04]: the mid-Atlantic states, including West
Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_04]: Delaware, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a distribution map of brown
marmorated stink bug throughout the 48
[SPEAKER_04]: continental United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: The red indicates states where we have
seen both severe agricultural problems as
[SPEAKER_04]: well as nuisance problems from the fall
immigration of bugs from host plants to
[SPEAKER_04]: potential overwintering sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: The yellow states are highlighted in that
they have had reports of nuisance problems
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fall with homeowners, but no
agricultural injury reported yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when you see these yellow states,
what that is indicative of is establishing
[SPEAKER_04]: populations where the populations are
beginning to increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then of course, the green states mean that
we've had specimens detected, but no
[SPEAKER_04]: injury reported and no nuisance problems
reported.
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, brown marmorated stink bug
has been detected officially in 33 states
[SPEAKER_04]: and the District of Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we were very interested in
brown marmorated, and when I found the
[SPEAKER_04]: first specimen back in 2003, we began
tracking it, was because we were seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing injury from our native species,
and in the mid-Atlantic, we have three,
[SPEAKER_04]: the brown and dusky stink bug,
Eustista servus and tristigmus,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the green stink bug, Acristernum
hilari.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in tree fruit, this is the typical
injury that we find from native stink
[SPEAKER_04]: bugs, where on peaches, we see the
cat-facing and gomosis early in the
[SPEAKER_04]: season, and then on apple, which was
typically late season injury, we see these
[SPEAKER_04]: corky and dented depressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is with our native species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, the reason for that injury has
to do with the changes in our management
[SPEAKER_04]: programs over the years after the advent
of FQPA, where we began to shift from our
[SPEAKER_04]: broader spectrum materials to more
specific chemistries that were softer on
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficials and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were really removing those broad
spectrum materials from the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this did was really allowed
increased injury from secondary pests like
[SPEAKER_04]: native stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So during that time, we were developing
monitoring tools for native stink bugs to
[SPEAKER_04]: determine the need for and timing of
insecticide apple applications.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here you can see the yellow
ground-deployed pyramid trap that we had
[SPEAKER_04]: developed over a number of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also were working on attract and kill
strategies for native stink bugs as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for a number of years, we weren't
seeing any injury, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_04]: from brown marmorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in late 2008 and 2009,
this is what we began to observe in
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see on the upper part of the slide a
mature peach with adult brown marmorated
[SPEAKER_04]: stink bugs feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you peel that skin away,
this is the typical injury we would see,
[SPEAKER_04]: this corky, dry tissue beneath,
and blow as an apple with the large
[SPEAKER_04]: indented depressions, again, from brown
marmorated stink bug feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in 2009, we were actually having quite
a bit of economic injury here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: eastern panhandle.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just one example of a commercial
apple orchard, a family-run operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have about 1,100 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: They produce about a half million bushels
annually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by 2009, brown marmorated stink bug
was their number one pest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nearly 10% of all the fruit they
harvested, in this case 45,000 bushels of
[SPEAKER_04]: apples, had to be redirected from fresh
market to processing due to brown
[SPEAKER_04]: marmorated stink bug injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly for commercial growers,
the loss of value was somewhere between
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% and 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, already a tremendous pest.
[SPEAKER_04]: In 2009, the other thing that we observed
was a tremendously large overwintering
[SPEAKER_04]: population.
[SPEAKER_04]: These photographs were taken on the our
building here at the lab at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Appalachian Fruit Research Station.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see the adults aggregating on
the sides of the building.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the lower left, you can see the bumper
of someone's vehicle with brown marmorated
[SPEAKER_04]: stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this really highlights the fact that
they are excellent hitchhikers and can be
[SPEAKER_04]: taken to new areas just because of this
behavior we see in the fall, where they
[SPEAKER_04]: aggregate in tight quarters, including
vehicles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also had problems with them
actually clogging our air intake vent,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you see in the upper right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm going to do now is sort of
take you through what we learned in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of 2010 in the field season, in terms of
the different hosts that were attacked,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the types of injury that we observed.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the winter of 2010, we had a tremendous
snowfall here in the mid-Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_04]: something we are not very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a lot of snow cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the question is, did that snow cover
in some way help brown marmorated stink
[SPEAKER_04]: bug over winter more effectively?
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, we had higher
survivorship.
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is we don't know at this point,
but certainly it's a question we have to
[SPEAKER_04]: address.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we learned next was by April
2010, much earlier than we had ever
[SPEAKER_04]: observed before, we began to spot brown
marmorated stink bugs in some of our
[SPEAKER_04]: experimental orchards here on the farm,
but also out in commercial orchards as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we began photographing them just to
sort of document that early season
[SPEAKER_04]: activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we presumed, because many orchard
cover sprays are going on at this time,
[SPEAKER_04]: this would protect the fruit from any
injury from brown marmorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you can see it's May 5th,
and they're feeding on Montmorency cherry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they are on May 10th, feeding on a
loring peach.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 20 millimeters in diameter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Granny Smith apple on June 10th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And seckel pear also on June 10th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're starting to get an idea of
the number of different hosts this insect
[SPEAKER_04]: will feed upon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, we were hoping that cover
sprays would be controlling this insect,
[SPEAKER_04]: but indeed that was not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by late June, we were starting to see
the first evidence of this early season
[SPEAKER_04]: activity in commercial orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this case, it was very specific to
stone fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a peach that is immature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're seeing on the surface is a
bit of gomosis on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you cut that open, this is
something that's very unique to brown
[SPEAKER_04]: marmorated stink bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw these pockets of dead and sort of
gummy, dry tissue internally in the fruit
[SPEAKER_04]: because of that early season feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it appears to us as the fruit
expanded, these pockets also expanded as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also began to observe something that
was very different from our native
[SPEAKER_04]: species, which is not only was it adult
feeding, but also nymphal feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically from our native species,
we really only worried about the adults.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the final major difference was
that we were learning that, in fact,
[SPEAKER_04]: brown marmorated stink bug could reproduce
in commercial orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: With our native species, they typically
would reproduce on broadleaf weeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: then move into orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was not the case with brown
marmorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are on July 21st.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see both adults and nymphs
feeding on peaches, immature peaches in
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the gomosis and injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then by the late July, we began to really
see the devastation from this insect.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some photographs taken from
commercial orchards that had total losses
[SPEAKER_04]: of their early season peach varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the grower made the decision
to strip those trees and allow the fruit
[SPEAKER_04]: to rot on the ground because it was
essentially 100% loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look up through this orchard
and just every fruit that's on the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: had just extensive brown marmorated stink
bug injuries.
[SPEAKER_04]: From that early season feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we began to see the other host that
this insect would attack.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, this is field corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see both adults and nymphs
feeding through the husk on the kernels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what happens is the kernels do not
develop properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also feed on sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they do, the kernels turn brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of brown marmorated stink bug
feeding on silk, they were implicated and
[SPEAKER_04]: interfering with pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had a number of farmers,
as they were cutting the corn for silage,
[SPEAKER_04]: the brown marmorated stink bugs in the
fields were so thick at that time,
[SPEAKER_04]: literally they had to turn on their
windshield wipers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so from that, then the question is,
that silage that was created, would this
[SPEAKER_04]: deter cattle from feeding on it because of
the presence of the brown marmorated stink
[SPEAKER_04]: bugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it did not, could it in fact taint
the milk because of those defensive
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds from the insect?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an open question as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we also saw extensive injury on
raspberries where they were feeding on the
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was both, again, nymphs and
adults.
[SPEAKER_04]: And severe feeding leads to the fruit not
coming free of the receptacle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we started to see sort of dieback
at the tips of the shoots, which again we
[SPEAKER_04]: think may have something to do either with
their salivary enzymes or perhaps they're
[SPEAKER_04]: introducing something into the plant that
could again be causing this dieback at the
[SPEAKER_04]: tips that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also attack a number of vegetable
crops, including tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the injury on the surface on
that ripe tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really do like tomatoes as well,
as well as bell peppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw a lot of injury on bell peppers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see the injury, the dry corky
tissue beneath the surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't limited to vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, this is a row crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the center where you see the
part of the field that is referred to as
[SPEAKER_04]: unaffected, where the soybean plants are
starting to dry and senesce.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is typically what we would see.
[SPEAKER_04]: But around the edges of fields where you
see that green area, that is from brown
[SPEAKER_04]: marmorated stink bug feeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plants do not senesce properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's sort of a vegetative response.
[SPEAKER_04]: They remain green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the pods do not develop properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The beans do not develop properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was a major issue for soybean
growers here in the mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the soybeans could not be harvested
correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, there was losses as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also, at late August, we see this
intense late season feeding period just
[SPEAKER_04]: prior to them entering overwintering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so on apple, what we began to see was
really serious injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a pink lady apple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just about six to eight weeks before
harvest, you see the fruit is quite deep
[SPEAKER_04]: in the fruit's flesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so obviously, this is unacceptable for
fresh market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, if it's redirected to
processing, the loss of value can be up to
[SPEAKER_04]: 90%.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a number of growers that were in
this position.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now the question is, what are the
processors going to be doing in 2011?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this injury is very deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult for them to peel out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there may be new requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, due to the extensive feeding,
there may have been questions of premature
[SPEAKER_04]: drop of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we also saw them feeding on
ornamental nursery crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they are feeding on noray maple on
the left and a newly planted peach tree on
[SPEAKER_04]: the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't really know what impact that
feeding may have, but certainly with the
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers that were out there, we were
concerned.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also saw them feeding on grape late in
the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: This became an issue for a number of
vineyards who had to get them out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: clusters or the lugs because of issues
potentially with taint to the wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the feeding themselves causes
collapse of the berries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were also a presence of
increased rots, despite the fact it was a
[SPEAKER_04]: very dry year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the issues in grape.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also saw them in nut crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are pictures of hazelnuts with
feeding injury as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see the host range is extremely
broad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that took us to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in fact, the injury did not end there
because throughout the Mid-Atlantic,
[SPEAKER_04]: growers who put fruit into storage at
harvest, seemingly clean, four to five
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks later, we're starting to see injury
emerge from this late season feeding that
[SPEAKER_04]: occurred during that pre-harvest interval
late in the season just prior to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not visible when the injury
first occurs, but several weeks later it
[SPEAKER_04]: appears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the Mid-Atlantic, there's been
some surveys done by U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple with growers reporting or some of
these storage facilities reporting up to
[SPEAKER_04]: 60% of the fruit coming out of cold
storage having injury.
[SPEAKER_04]: So serious, serious problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's been going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at the national level, one of the
issues was just getting the word out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so back in September, we held a
meeting at two commercial orchards in
[SPEAKER_04]: Maryland, Catoctin Mountain and Garden
Hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this really brought together both the
leadership from USDA, as well as other
[SPEAKER_04]: government agencies, state departments of
ag, and the research and extension
[SPEAKER_04]: community to look at this problem and
really get people talking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was one of the events that
really has been useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another has been the press.
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly, the press really
started to pick up on the crop injury at
[SPEAKER_04]: the same time when the homeowner issues
began in the fall when the brown
[SPEAKER_04]: marmorated stink bugs moved to homeowner
sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably one of the best photographs
that appeared was in the New York Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see the headline of the
article, Move Over Bed Bugs, Stink Bugs
[SPEAKER_04]: Have Landed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly if you're competing with bed
bugs for press, you know it's a serious
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see these folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about a half an hour from our lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are literally sweeping up brown
marmorated stink bugs into five gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tremendous numbers of insects out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other group that's been very useful is
the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Working
[SPEAKER_04]: Group that's led by myself and George
Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this group is designed to bring the
research and extension community together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we have been able to do is to
develop priorities for research and
[SPEAKER_04]: extension and regulatory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in looking at this list, you'll
probably be able to see that really we are
[SPEAKER_04]: at the beginning in terms of understanding
this insect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this really leads into the research
that we've been conducting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the things we've been
working on is developing a monitoring tool
[SPEAKER_04]: for growers that essentially will allow
them to detect the presence, abundance,
[SPEAKER_04]: and seasonal activity of brown marmorated
stink bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ultimately to design behaviorally
based strategies like attracting killer
[SPEAKER_04]: mass trapping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me quickly take you through some of
the work that we've done toward a
[SPEAKER_04]: monitoring tool looking for visual cues
that can be incorporated into a trap
[SPEAKER_04]: design, olfactory cues, the lures we use,
a capture mechanism that is compatible
[SPEAKER_04]: with their movement patterns, and then a
deployment strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where and when do we deploy these traps?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we have done so far is look at
visual cues associated with a pyramid
[SPEAKER_04]: trap, one that we had used for our native
stink bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we evaluated these five different
visual stimuli sources with baited and
[SPEAKER_04]: unbaited traps over a two-year period.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were able to capture a lot of
stink bugs, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we found was that for both nymphs
and adults, a darker pyramid that has
[SPEAKER_04]: baited with a known attractant is by far
superior.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here you see adult captures in 2009,
a baited black pyramid trap.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2010, there was no difference between our
dark green and black.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the nymphs as well, we're seeing
a baited black pyramid trap being
[SPEAKER_04]: superior.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the first piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second is what we're doing right now
is the fact that brown marmorated stink
[SPEAKER_04]: bug interestingly respond to wavelengths
and intensities of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in this case, what we've been doing
is trying to discern what are those
[SPEAKER_04]: wavelengths and intensities so we can
incorporate it into a trap design.
[SPEAKER_04]: This picture, by the way, was taken at a
bank in Spring Mills, West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the size of the aggregation around
this light was estimated to be about a
[SPEAKER_04]: million individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a light bioassay right now
that's trying to capture that information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see where we're releasing
insects into this arena and tracking their
[SPEAKER_04]: movement and determining those wavelengths
and intensities.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also are trying to identify the true
pheromone.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are headspace collection chambers
that allow us to identify the headspace
[SPEAKER_04]: volatiles being released by, in this case,
adult male bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we hope in collaboration with Dr.
Ai-jen Zhang, who's leading this part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the project, we'll have a better
attractant that we can use with our traps
[SPEAKER_04]: to really lure these insects in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another piece of this puzzle.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of capture mechanisms and
deployment strategies, interestingly,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are a few commercially available
traps from Asia that we were able to get
[SPEAKER_04]: our hands on and compare with our
prototype black pyramid trap, which you
[SPEAKER_04]: see on the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, the traps that were
available from Japan, they were different
[SPEAKER_04]: in that on the left, you see this clear
sort of pyramid trap you deploy in the
[SPEAKER_04]: canopy of trees compared with the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: The center is this yellow water trap that
considered to be visually stimulating to
[SPEAKER_04]: the insect and, again, deployed in the
tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were able to compare these at our
farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we saw was, in this case,
that our black pyramid trap was superior
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of capturing both adults and
nymphs compared with these commercially
[SPEAKER_04]: available traps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is where we are right now
in terms of being able to monitor adult
[SPEAKER_04]: and nymphal populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to wrap up this portion,
we are using this dark visual stimulus as
[SPEAKER_04]: part of our trap design.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ground deployed pyramid because
both adults and nymphs have a tendency to
[SPEAKER_04]: walk up surfaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their natural behavior.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a known attractant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is particularly good for the nymphs
season long, but the adults really don't
[SPEAKER_04]: respond strongly until later in the
season.
[SPEAKER_04]: So identification of a pheromone is really
critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we hope to augment these trap
designs with light based on our optimal
[SPEAKER_04]: wavelengths and intensities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the last piece I want to talk about
with you today before I wrap up is just
[SPEAKER_04]: the challenges we've observed in managing
brown marmorated stink bug in commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: plantings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one of the issues is that brown
marmorated stink bug has an incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: broad host range.
[SPEAKER_04]: They feed on over 300 different plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this means is tremendous season
long pressure from populations moving from
[SPEAKER_04]: wild hosts into cultivated crops like our
commercial orchards.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of managing them, we've seen
greatest efficacy when adults have direct
[SPEAKER_04]: contact with finished wet spray material.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, because they're constantly
immigrating into plots, only a small
[SPEAKER_04]: population have contact with that
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, they have incredible avoidance
behaviors that allow them to potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: escape treatments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, insecticides that are labeled
as excellent against native species have
[SPEAKER_04]: not shown the same efficacy against brown
marmorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, we have seen knockdown and
recovery from a number of compounds and
[SPEAKER_04]: other compounds being completely
ineffective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me show you this knockdown and
recovery phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did was to treat one acre plots
with tombstone, which is a pyrethroid,
[SPEAKER_04]: or vidate, a carbamate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We recovered these bugs from these plots
and followed their mortality over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason we did this is because in
grower orchards where we saw them spraying
[SPEAKER_04]: pyrethroids, particularly like worrier and
asana, literally 80% of the bugs recovered
[SPEAKER_04]: within 24 to 48 hours and were climbing
back up into the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: As incredible as that sounds, that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, from this small bioassay
that we did, what you can see is we
[SPEAKER_04]: tracked mortality over five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at the time of collection,
all of the bugs were moribund,
[SPEAKER_04]: meaning they were unable to move,
but they were still alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their antenna or leg might be twitching,
but they could not climb vertical
[SPEAKER_04]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: or move on horizontal surfaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So red is dead, and alive means they are
capable of moving once again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see that with tombstone,
by the end of the trial, about a third of
[SPEAKER_04]: them had recovered from that exposure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this was the issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did was to think about that in
designing an insecticide evaluation that
[SPEAKER_04]: we conducted over the winter months,
where we really needed to deal with what
[SPEAKER_04]: we considered to be the primary threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those insects that come in after the spray
residue is dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this case, what we believe is
control will depend on residual
[SPEAKER_04]: effectiveness and likelihood of uptake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our laboratory bioassay was designed to
be biologically relevant based on that
[SPEAKER_04]: primary threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all of the compounds that we
evaluated through this three-part trial
[SPEAKER_04]: required about 24 person hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the list of materials we have
evaluated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We evaluated both carbamates,
organophosphates, pyrethroids,
[SPEAKER_04]: neonicotinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked at the organochlorine material
thiodan, or endostophin, as well as other
[SPEAKER_04]: classes and newer chemistries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this three-part bioassay included,
first of all, using Ethovision,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a software package that allows us
to track their movements on insecticide
[SPEAKER_04]: treated dishes in a horizontal plane.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it tracks horizontal mobility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would conduct these trials over a
four and a half hour period where they
[SPEAKER_04]: were exposed to these dry residues that
had been cured for 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we would remove them from these
dishes and then look at their capacity for
[SPEAKER_04]: vertical movement to sort of mimic what
may happen if they were climbing back up
[SPEAKER_04]: into the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we tracked mortality for seven
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't go into all of these results,
but what I want to show you is the type of
[SPEAKER_04]: tracks that emerged from, first of all,
the horizontal mobility, where you can see
[SPEAKER_04]: on the top, with water as a control,
the bugs kind of meandered around the
[SPEAKER_04]: dishes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't really any impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with Warrior, a pyrethroid,
you can see at zero hours, they appear to
[SPEAKER_04]: be very stimulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within one hour, you can see the track
becomes more irregular.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're succumbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And within two hours, you can see it looks
like the bug's just about dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we would have interpreted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in fact, because of that knockdown and
recovery, all of those bugs, 100% of those
[SPEAKER_04]: tests had recovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they could even reproduce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we tracked bug mortality for seven
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this provided us with this lethality
index.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this is a long list of
materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I wanted to point out is that we,
basically, we ranked each of these
[SPEAKER_04]: materials based on how quickly they
succumbed to the material and also the
[SPEAKER_04]: overall rate of mortality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see that a lot of the
materials are older broad-spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: materials that were most effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to wrap this part up, in terms of the
insecticide work, broad-spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: materials, including dimethoate,
malathion, bifenthrin, methadathion,
[SPEAKER_04]: and osulfan and methanol, provided the
greatest levels of contact lethality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, certainly within each class,
the patterns of lethality are similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a substantial amount of
variation between active ingredients in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the intensity of effects on
mobility and mortality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on the activity of registered and
unregistered compounds, section 18 for
[SPEAKER_04]: dinotephuran, also known as safari or
venom, is being pursued for tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Virginia as the lead state,
this is a mid-Atlantic regional
[SPEAKER_04]: application.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of tree fruit and other
crops, recommendations are being put
[SPEAKER_04]: together based on what we have in the
mid-Atlantic, which is a season-long
[SPEAKER_04]: threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I know in other areas, it'll probably
still be more of a late-season threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in other areas, obviously,
it isn't well established.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of where we are right now,
we have formed a nationwide team of 50
[SPEAKER_04]: research and extension personnel
throughout the U.S., representing 14
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions in 10 states.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've put in a very large number
[SPEAKER_04]: of research projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of my lab's work,
we're going to continue to work on the
[SPEAKER_04]: monitoring tools and behaviorally-based
management strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the bottom line for Brown Marmorated
is that it's going to require a sustained
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperative, collaborative, and integrated
approach for research and extension on a
[SPEAKER_04]: national scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will tell you that certainly within
the strawberry industry, folks are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be looking for Brown Marmorated in 2011
and trying to document any problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, none have been reported.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the broad host range,
we have to be extremely cautious and
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly document the host that this
insect may attack.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is my lab group that work with me
on all of the projects that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: conducting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are a great bunch of folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, finally, my colleagues and
growers and others throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: mid-Atlantic and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: who have worked with me on this project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would be happy to get any questions,
Kathy, if there are any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Tracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll give you a chance to think
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tracy will be back with us after
Stephen does his presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next speaker is Mr. Stephen Koike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stephen joined the Monterey County Office
of the University of California
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooperative Extension in 1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a plant pathology farm advisor,
Steve is involved in educational programs
[SPEAKER_01]: and applied research in vegetable,
fruit, and ornamental crop diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: His research emphasizes diseases of
vegetables, epidemiology of disease
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, fungicide evaluations,
identification of new diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ecology of fungi, exploration of
alternative disease control methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as alternative fungicides,
biological agents, organic agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: disease management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve is also involved in applied research
of foodborne pathogens, primarily E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, as they occur in agricultural field
settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educational efforts consist of informing
clientele of research results,
[SPEAKER_01]: tailoring results to commercial
operations, and diagnosing problems found
[SPEAKER_01]: in field and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve operates the University of
California Cooperative Extension Plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathology Diagnostic Lab located in
Salinas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2007, he published his first book,
A Color Handbook of Diseases in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see there's some questions about the
stink bug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to take those or should I
just go ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, I didn't see those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be glad to wait if you wanted to do
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could do that for just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Laura McDermott would like to know,
Tracy, if brown marmorated stink bug is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pest of blueberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so Dean Polk at Rutgers did document
them feeding on the late season variety,
[SPEAKER_04]: Elliot, in 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, there hasn't been,
I mean, they're going to be doing
[SPEAKER_04]: season-long monitoring this year,
so that's what I can tell you at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Pam Fisher would like to know how it
moves to new areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally, we think that, first of all,
they are spread, in some cases,
[SPEAKER_04]: by their fall overwintering behaviors,
in that they end up in people's belongings
[SPEAKER_04]: and they move them to a new location.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly, we've also seen,
as they established here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mid-Atlantic, that they move themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that leading edge of the
population has continued to move through
[SPEAKER_04]: our region and head south.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both of those are sort of providing the
spread, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deb Moreau would like to know if your
pyramid traps or patterns thereof are
[SPEAKER_01]: available for other collaborators.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a blueprint that's available,
and also there is a commercial provider
[SPEAKER_04]: that is making them this year egg bio,
which I can provide that to you,
[SPEAKER_04]: Kathy, if you want to pass both the
blueprint and that information on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Martin is wondering where they
overwinter, and can they be targeted at
[SPEAKER_01]: the overwintering site?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that at least some portion of the
population certainly ends up in structures
[SPEAKER_04]: and homes and things like that,
but in nature, it's a big question,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the preferred overwintering
sites?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done scouting and found them under
sort of bark on trees, as well as sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: in rocky crevices and things like that,
and that's where they've been reported in
[SPEAKER_04]: Asia as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we don't know, and so we have
some experiments designed this year to
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of set up both understanding where
they overwinter most effectively in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of survivorship, but also trying to track
their movements to potential overwintering
[SPEAKER_04]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carla is wondering if there's any
influence of temperature or weather on
[SPEAKER_01]: insect movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, both at the high and the low end.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know exactly what those
thresholds are, but at lower temperatures,
[SPEAKER_04]: we see them more than likely just walking
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely, I don't know what that
threshold is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even at higher temperatures on some of
our hotter days, these bugs would hunker
[SPEAKER_04]: down and sort of just rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we have to define what those
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and the last one for now, Bob is
wondering if they have parasitoids for
[SPEAKER_01]: these insects in Asia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a species of wasp in the family
Selenionidae genus Trisulcus that has been
[SPEAKER_04]: reported to parasitize up to 80% of the
eggs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, those have been collected and
are in quarantine at our sister facility
[SPEAKER_04]: in Newark, Delaware.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Kim Homer has been screening these
potentially for release within the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we're still very early in that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pam Fisher commented, Bob would probably
like to go on a collecting trip.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be time to ask more questions of
Tracy at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first, I want to thank Kathy and the
organizers of the webinar for inviting me
[SPEAKER_03]: to participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate the chance to share some
things that are happening out here west in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first of all, I want to say I really
enjoyed Tracy's presentation and learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes me glad I'm a plant
pathologist, because some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures are creeping me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I would like to see all
those bugs around my house or my vents
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a very interesting Tracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my talk is very consistent and
very appropriate to put with Tracy,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'll be talking about some recent
challenges to strawberry out west here,
[SPEAKER_03]: which also involved new problems and
perhaps recent introductions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the principles and things might
really mesh well with what Tracy talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I think the audience here is
probably very experienced.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just to pull us all together,
I'm going to be talking about some soil
[SPEAKER_03]: borne issues, some new soil borne issues
on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here's a picture just showing us to
remind us that soil borne problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: by definition, are plant pathogens that
are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the top left, you can see what's
called lettuce dieback disease on lettuce.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a very strange disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very strange pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a soil borne virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: The virus is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spread in the soil and the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is very aggressive and causes
significant problems on certain types of
[SPEAKER_03]: lettuce, like this romaine picture here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bottom left, here's a soil borne
problem on onion.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is white rot, a very destructive
disease on that group of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to the right, verticillium wilt
on strawberry, probably a very familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: disease to many of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, a soil borne problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to be talking about
these new issues that are soil borne
[SPEAKER_03]: issues in California and on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to pull together the basics of
this type of issue, again, I think a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of you in the audience already know this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some very distinctive
features of these challenges that are in
[SPEAKER_03]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, they often survive for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pathogens in the soil sometimes can
actually survive for decades without a
[SPEAKER_03]: host plant there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you might guess, that is a
tremendous headache for a producer,
[SPEAKER_03]: for a grower or farmer, because even if
you're not growing the crop, the fungus or
[SPEAKER_03]: the pathogen is still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're very long-term survivors in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're often difficult to detect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some good tools for some of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of trying to know whether
your field has one or more of these
[SPEAKER_03]: problems, it's not always that easy to
find out before you plant the crop and
[SPEAKER_03]: before you see the problem occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sometimes difficult to detect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And find them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably would add to the slide,
they're also difficult to diagnose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll touch on that later in the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes knowing which one you have
is often not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned, these would be very
damaging, talking about plant death or on
[SPEAKER_03]: the brighter side, just crop loss in terms
of yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: These problems, again, are very
significant economic factors in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the reason why they're so
important and damaging is that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: easily spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite like stink bugs, but we spread
these ourselves, meaning we as farmers and
[SPEAKER_03]: growers and people.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, these are primarily
spread as contaminants in dirt or mud and
[SPEAKER_03]: on equipment, on tractors, on trucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably the growers and the pest
control advisors and field walkers and all
[SPEAKER_03]: these people who are moving equipment and
vehicles around, that's how we spread a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can also spread them in propagation
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the time, we're spreading them
in the dirt in which they're found.
[SPEAKER_03]: One problem in terms of managing
soil-borne problems or pathogens,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the most part, fungicides are not very
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could probably find exceptions if we
look around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, your fusariums,
your verticilliums, all these many
[SPEAKER_03]: soil-borne problems don't respond well and
are not really controlled well by
[SPEAKER_03]: fungicides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then often, these pathogens have a
wide host range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may be growing strawberry or crop
X.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll say, well, I have too much of a
problem with the soil-borne problem on
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll plant something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Often, that other crop can also be a host
and will prolong that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a complicated set of factors here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this one slide kind of summarizes
these features of soil-borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the issue that's happening out in
California is a fairly recent one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to walk you through what's
happening out here west regarding this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say that even if you're not
out west here and you are a strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: grower somewhere else in the country or
you grow some other crop and you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have these issues, I still would argue
this might be of interest to you because
[SPEAKER_03]: it kind of possibly mirrors or acts as a
model for what happens when new pathogens
[SPEAKER_03]: are introduced to an area and when new
problems occur and how you approach it,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you diagnose these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, again, even if you're not
sharing our issue particularly at the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment with Californians, the information
and the history that I'll show here
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly can be reproduced in your area
with a different crop or a different
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by recent, what I mean is the dieback
and collapse issues on strawberry that are
[SPEAKER_03]: new, we first began to see in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, from 2005 through the
present, we've seen an increasing
[SPEAKER_03]: incidence, meaning we've seen these
problems spread throughout the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: In one county, we had two fields that had
the problem in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: By 2010, there were 12 fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're seeing more and more growers and
more and more ranches affected by that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important to point out, these new
dieback and collapse problems which I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: show you are not associated with and have
never been associated with the other
[SPEAKER_03]: well-known pathogens that already occur in
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a strawberry person,
you know that there's phytophthora issues
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's verticillium and there's
rhizoctonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there are some well-documented
historical soilborne pathogens on
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: These new problems I'm showing you today
have never been associated with these
[SPEAKER_03]: other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other important association here,
almost without exception, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: occurring in fields that no longer receive
the traditional fumigation treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in California, of course, you know our
industry has really relied on methyl
[SPEAKER_03]: bromide and chloropicrin flat fumigation,
meaning we're applying that fumigation to
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire field, not just to the beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that practice has really made it
successful in terms of yields and dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: value.
[SPEAKER_03]: These new problems are occurring in these
fields that no longer receive that
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional flat fumigation, either
because of cost or, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: the change in the regulations and with
methyl bromide leaving on its way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those factors, not associated with
previous pathogens that are known to occur
[SPEAKER_03]: and occurring where we no longer fumigate
in the same traditional way, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: really hallmarks of these new problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now today, we know that there are two
major pathogens associated with these
[SPEAKER_03]: problems, macrophomina, phageolina,
which causes a disease called charcoal
[SPEAKER_03]: rot, and a strain of fusarium oxysporum,
which causes fusarium wilt on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither of these were known to occur on
strawberry in California prior to 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the history, again,
of what's happening, initially,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you some maps, but initially,
we only saw these problems in Southern
[SPEAKER_03]: California, where we have our southern
crop, and now it's occurring in other
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of California, and I'll illustrate
that for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in a second here, I'm going to
show you what it looks like if you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with these diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the symptoms are very much
characterized here by this list.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the wilting of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's overall poor growth and
performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as the disease progresses and as
you go into the season, eventually,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants will actually collapse and die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you examine these plants,
it's very important to dig them up out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground and cut them open and look
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see a very distinctive
discoloration of the inner tissues,
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily the crown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's take a look at these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is charcoal rot caused by the fungus
macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a soil-borne fungus that's known
to occur in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe you would share my opinion
that this is a significant problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see this type of photograph or if
this is your field, we have distinct areas
[SPEAKER_03]: where a large percentage of the plants
collapse and die, as pictured here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little closer up look to show you,
again, macrophomina or charcoal rot
[SPEAKER_03]: occurring on strawberry, and plants,
especially the one in the bottom center
[SPEAKER_03]: photo, showing advanced cases where
they're collapsing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photo in the upper right, and let me
try, Kathy's trained me on this arrow
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you can see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photo on the upper right, this is a
collapsed plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I point it out to you now because
later I'll talk about diagnosing and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to identify these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I would argue and debate with you
the fact that this type of symptom looks
[SPEAKER_03]: very much like it could be infected with
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if you're looking to,
say, identify this just based on the
[SPEAKER_03]: picture or on a visual of the plant,
I think that's a dangerous assumption
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is macrophomina and not
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned to you to assist in
diagnosing it, you need to dig up these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and cut them open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the macrophomina always shows a very
distinctive discoloration in the crown
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know already that the healthy plant
tissue will be cream-colored or
[SPEAKER_03]: light-colored like this, but the infected
plant with macrophomina will have these
[SPEAKER_03]: very distinctly dark discolored sections
of the crown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are three examples of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we do here in California,
of course in all states where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: plant pathologists like myself,
you give these plants to a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: pathologist and they'll take out through a
sterile procedure, they'll take out small
[SPEAKER_03]: bits of that crown tissue and put it in a
petri plate with appropriate media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you see in the upper left
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that black speckly colony growing out
from those strawberry pieces, that is the
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the way you confirm the
presence of this pathogen in strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: crowns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I mentioned earlier one reason
why these pathogens like macrophomina are
[SPEAKER_03]: so dangerous and bothersome, they last in
the soil for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here in the large photo in the front,
you could see why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every one of these little black specks is
one survival structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called a microsclerotium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single one of these little black
specks is like a seed for the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very hard, it's black, which means
it's able to resist ultraviolet light,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's able to survive and persist in
the soil for a prolonged period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what the fungus makes to
enable it to survive to the next crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the next strawberry crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular photograph shows the size
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's my trusty penny at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is grown in a sand and corn meal
medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here you can see these little
crystalline pieces here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are little grains of sand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this gives you an idea of the size of
the microsclerotium, how they're very
[SPEAKER_03]: small, and how, if the fungus is making
these, these are easily transported in
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminated soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: These can be in the soil in just a clot of
mud on a tractor or a disc.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you move that disc to a clean
field, you've moved these microsclerotia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this shows, again, why that's a problem
for our growers and people in ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's the first problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one is fusarium wilt,
and it's basically following the same
[SPEAKER_03]: pattern here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently introduced in California,
not seen before in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: soil borne problem, spreading the soil,
and we began by seeing it in small
[SPEAKER_03]: patches.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photograph at the top shows what we
began to see in, I think, 2006,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, where these small areas in our
strawberry fields began to collapse and
[SPEAKER_03]: die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time, these patches got larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photograph in the bottom on the front
shows a couple years later where these
[SPEAKER_03]: patches have gotten much larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: More plants are affected, and we're
beginning to be very concerned about
[SPEAKER_03]: spread to new areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a close-up of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fusarium wilt on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, our second new development in
fields that are no longer receiving the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional flat-fume treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a second, I'll talk about
diagnosing these.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I would argue that you and I,
we cannot separate this photograph from
[SPEAKER_03]: the macrophomina ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant symptoms are identical and also
resemble verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you need to dig up these plants and
look at them and cut them open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, just like the macrophomina,
the fusarium wilt causes a very
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctive dark discoloration in the
inner crown tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, again, one cannot diagnose this,
particularly by looking at the outer
[SPEAKER_03]: collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to dig up the plant, cut open the
crown, and look for this type of symptom
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as I've just shown you with
macrophomina, I'm telling you this is
[SPEAKER_03]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you say, well, how can you separate
these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you cannot separate again based on
the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you take these plants to your friendly
neighborhood plant pathologist,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we will, again, plate pieces of that
strawberry tissue on the appropriate
[SPEAKER_03]: medium and look for what grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, this is the fusarium,
which has a different look to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a very pinkish color in this
medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can diagnose it based on this
recovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photograph in the lower left shows you
the survival structures for this fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are called chlamytospores.
[SPEAKER_03]: It functions very much the same as those
black specks of the macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: It survives in the soil for a prolonged
period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It resists weathering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how the fungus survives
between crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from year to year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to show you our dilemma or our issue
and concern, here are two snapshots in
[SPEAKER_03]: time, as you will, for our state regarding
macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2005, we began to see, detect,
and confirm the macrophomina on strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was only in two counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a significant strawberry industry
in Ventura County and Orange County.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the two orange, I'm sorry,
those are the two pink stars there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2005, we began to get concern for our
Southern California growers because of
[SPEAKER_03]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, while we fast forward now
to 2010, we have a number of other
[SPEAKER_03]: counties that also report and have
confirmed the same macrophomina on
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you probably know, our major area of
strawberry production in California is the
[SPEAKER_03]: central part of the state all the way down
through the South.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Monterey County, actually where
I'm located here in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Monterey County South, we have the
majority of the state's strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that four out of the major
five counties for strawberry in this area
[SPEAKER_03]: have the macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: The four counties to the North have
smaller, more limited strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the acreage is limited, but they also
have the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see why we're concerned about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The future, when you have this spread and
increasing incidence throughout our state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I want to show you a similar
pattern, although at this point,
[SPEAKER_03]: fewer stars, thankfully, for Fusarium wilt
on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2006 was the first year we confirmed
Fusarium on strawberry in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see that the only place we
found it was in Ventura.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we fast forward to 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two sites, two counties with the
Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good news, bad news.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is it has not spread to,
say, 10 or eight counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad news is, however, the Fusarium has
been found in one of our major strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: producing areas, and that's my home base
in Monterey County here in the Central
[SPEAKER_03]: Coast of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though there are only two counties
affected, these two counties probably
[SPEAKER_03]: account for, I would estimate,
65% to 70% of our state's strawberry
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though it's not statewide yet,
the Fusarium has touched down in our two
[SPEAKER_03]: major producing counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the distribution as of last
year, just for background information,
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina is not a new disease in
California only.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also occurring in other parts of the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might add, it's very interesting to
note that for all these other parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world reporting macrophomina, it's
primarily showing up, again, in locations
[SPEAKER_03]: where they no longer use methyl bromide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Egypt, France, India, Israel,
and Spain, these places are reporting
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina on strawberry, and these are
places where they are not using the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional fumigation practice anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: For macrophomina, we need to add
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia is another country that has
macrophomina on its strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the USA, maybe some of you know about
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where you all are from,
but right now in strawberry, it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: confirmed to be reported in California,
Florida, and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I talked to you earlier about the
counties in my own state with that map.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the distribution of Fusarium,
Fusarium is slightly different than
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: Macrophomina is a new worldwide
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by new is in the year 2000
and counting, that's when macrophomina
[SPEAKER_03]: began to be reported on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusarium is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fusarium is not a brand new disease
because I believe it's the Japanese and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe the Koreans reported Fusarium back
in the 1960s and early 1970s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Australia also has had it a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Fusarium on strawberry has been in the
world a longer time, and unfortunately now
[SPEAKER_03]: we in the USA are just added to that list
of infested countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us, it's brand new in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: For whatever reason, the Fusarium wilt
disease on strawberry has been reported in
[SPEAKER_03]: California and South Carolina in terms of
USA states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a minute here about
something that I think is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: practical for almost all of you probably
participating and listening in today,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is diagnosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grower or a pest control
advisor or you walk fields and make
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations or you're a salesperson
selling products to farmers and people in
[SPEAKER_03]: ag, you know that it's extremely important
and critical actually to identify and know
[SPEAKER_03]: what the problems are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you see a stink bug on your
crop, you better call Tracy to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: which one it is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to know what the problem is and
have a precise identification of the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for pathogens that originate in the
soil, that's very much a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as this photograph here illustrates,
I'd be glad to bet with you your lunch
[SPEAKER_03]: money about which pathogen or pathogens
might be responsible for these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, as a professional who work with
these 12 months of the year, I cannot tell
[SPEAKER_03]: which pathogens are responsible for these
dieback problems because it could be one
[SPEAKER_03]: of our new issues, macrophomina or
Fusarium, or it could be one of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: time favorites, verticillium phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to use just a couple minutes
here to illustrate why this is a very big
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge and why it's important to
recognize the issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first challenge is with our new
issues here, our new problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The macrophomina and Fusarium,
in my mind, are virtually identical in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor growth, stunting, dieback,
plant collapse, discoloration of that
[SPEAKER_03]: crown, which I showed you, and also,
I haven't talked about this too much,
[SPEAKER_03]: but very much stress related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these pathogens can really cause
the most severe damage when the crop is
[SPEAKER_03]: stressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is either through environmental
extremes when it's very hot and dry or
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a little bit of water stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grower and you're half a day
or a day late watering and the plant's a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit under stress because of that
water shortage, these pathogens are very
[SPEAKER_03]: aggressive and cause much more damage and
much more rapid development of problems
[SPEAKER_03]: under stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for macrophomina and Fusarium,
both of these act the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You and I cannot separate them readily
without a laboratory test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So diagnosing these are going to be a
problem for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a problem for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to expand this a little bit,
I mentioned the old time favorites,
[SPEAKER_03]: verticillin phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, these symptoms and
features are shared by all four of these
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two new ones, macrophomina and
Fusarium, and the old ones, verticillin
[SPEAKER_03]: phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have these types of symptoms,
in general, it's going to be very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult for you to know what's going on
without the support and help of a
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory or an extension pathologist or
someone who can actually have things
[SPEAKER_03]: tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one exception here is phytophthora is
really not considered a stress organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have phytophthora issues on
strawberries that are growing quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, as you know, being a water
mold, it likes lots of moisture in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the stress thing is not quite relevant
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some good questions here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be a good chance to take
these right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these problems worse under plastic
culture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Theresa can send me a follow-up
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you mean plastic culture,
meaning large hoop houses that cover the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole planted area or plastic-covered
beds, that the plastic is just covering
[SPEAKER_03]: the beds and the plants are planted into
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have these diseases ever been observed in
fumigated fields?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seen them in fumigated fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we need to qualify this here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, our experience is primarily
with the production fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: These production fields have been
fumigated with alternatives, not the
[SPEAKER_03]: methyl boronate chlorpichrine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been fumigated with these new
replacement materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are seeing these diseases in those
situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's fumigated with methyl boronate
chlorpichrine at the appropriate rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's the traditional treatment,
we do not see and have not seen those
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, we are seeing them in fumigated
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are ones that, again,
are in the new world being treated with
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, a question about nursery
stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of right now, and I think we need more
information from the nursery producers in
[SPEAKER_03]: our state, we have not heard of
significant problems of these two new
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens in the nursery production
counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have not seen that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do receive materials from them for
testing for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other things, and so far I have never
isolated macrophomina or fusarium from
[SPEAKER_03]: transplants coming from those areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do get the old standards, the
verticillum phytophthora, colototrichum,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no, we have not seen these new ones
from transplants yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Theresa got back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, okay, so I think she's
asking, do we see these problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: or are they worse in fields where the beds
are covered with plastic and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are planted into the plastic,
as opposed to the use of straw or mulch as
[SPEAKER_03]: a covering of the bed?
[SPEAKER_03]: For us in California, you may know this,
we do not use anything except plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not use straw or mulch covers for
strawberry production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we only see it in the beds with the
plastic, but that's because all
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries are planted into plastic
covered beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as of right now, I don't know how that
might, how that dynamic might play out for
[SPEAKER_03]: other types of bed covering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last question, then I'll move
on for a second here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, has macrophomina,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, can macrophomina be a
problem in a temperate climate zone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm only a mere plant pathologist,
so you need to define for me exactly what
[SPEAKER_03]: temperate climate means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does temperate mean me here in central
California?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mediterranean type climates?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look for the reply on that,
and I'll go ahead here and get to that
[SPEAKER_03]: question in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we in California have these
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you won't, but the way things
move in the world and with these new
[SPEAKER_03]: developments, perhaps you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we collectively going to do
about dealing with these problems?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think an audience like this
today, you're probably very experienced,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you could do this slide, you could put
this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would approach the macrophomina or
fusarium issues the same as you would any
[SPEAKER_03]: other soluborate issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing novel about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is novel is the fact we have new
pathogens on strawberry in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's novel is we're in an era where
we're losing the main tool, methyl
[SPEAKER_03]: bromide, that has been used in years past
to defeat these challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is not novel is how you deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the same as with other
soluborate issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, select the appropriate
site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you have the flexibility and
the ability to just move off site,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't plant in an area that reports a
history of this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know that this field over here down
the road has macrophomina, then you would
[SPEAKER_03]: not be well advised to lease that ground
and plant strawberry next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay away from known infested sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important is crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a diversified grower and you
grow things more than strawberry,
[SPEAKER_03]: just don't plant something that's a host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't plant strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have time to go into this today,
but we know or feel that this fungus will
[SPEAKER_03]: affect other crops that are known to be
hosts of macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example is pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have diseased strawberry in a
field, don't plant pepper there either,
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't plant strawberry anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try and rotate crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant lettuce, plant broccoli,
plant petunias, plant things that are not
[SPEAKER_03]: a host.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rotate away from that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rotate away from strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: For conventional growers, fumigation
remains a tool, a management tool,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the question is which materials?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you a slide near the end here
that shows our work in California that
[SPEAKER_03]: indicates some of the alternatives do
control the macrophomina and fusarium,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not 100%, and we are getting
escapes and we're getting a reinfestation
[SPEAKER_03]: of these problems, so that's not the
answer in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have fumigation that will help,
but it will not eradicate the problem
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not as good as methyl bromide
chlorpichrine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have access to resistant strawberry
cultivars, that is obviously a good
[SPEAKER_03]: management tool for soil-borne problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll again show you at the end some of our
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We show that there are differences in the
varieties, and so we have the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe in the future breed for some
resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of right now, we don't have true
resistance, but we have varieties that are
[SPEAKER_03]: more tolerant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant those if those are available and
they fit your situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned to you, both the new
problems are definitely stress-related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants that are stressed from
environmental extremes, and I think I
[SPEAKER_03]: forgot to mention fruit load.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants that are stressed with a very,
very heavy fruit load, that's good for
[SPEAKER_03]: you, the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bad for a strawberry plant that's
already infected with macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: A heavy fruit load puts a physiological
strain and stress on plants, and that will
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely create the onset of very severe
and fast-developing symptoms for these
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, of course, we talked about soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are moving dirty soil, infested
soil from place to place between fields,
[SPEAKER_03]: you are going to move these pathogens,
so stop that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having more and more growers
actually wash off equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big pain in the neck, but it's
something that is extremely important if
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to safeguard clean fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the long run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me quickly take a couple more
questions here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, oh, great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question about whether you can
have this problem show up in cooler
[SPEAKER_03]: climates like Northern Europe,
Poland, Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good question, and I would say,
of course, we never want to say never,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we can't say that, but we can say that
macrophomina and trisarium are both
[SPEAKER_03]: well-known as warmer temperature
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both of these pathogens prefer warmer
soils, and I think I won't go back here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can see from the slides,
in general, a lot of those countries that
[SPEAKER_03]: report the problem tend to have areas
where the climate is very warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as of right now, we haven't had any of
these reports from, say, Norway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think that the cooler climates
would either not have an issue with these
[SPEAKER_03]: on strawberry, or if you eventually have
them, the severity of the problem may be
[SPEAKER_03]: lessened because of the cooler climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both these pathogens like warmer
temperatures, and I know that's relative,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still, I think Northern European
production might not have the same issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I can't remember if Tracy,
I think we got Tracy's question.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to be leaving us soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question from Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, does this problem occur in soybean in
Illinois, or in soybean anywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, where plants are under stress?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Macrophomina is a well-known pathogen of
soybean.
[SPEAKER_03]: So soybean has been a known host of
macrophomina for a decade or longer,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably a long time, and so that's very
much a known part of the problems for
[SPEAKER_03]: soybean, and I don't know about the stress
thing for soybean, but I imagine the
[SPEAKER_03]: profile is similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the soybeans are under water stress or
other issues, we do tend to see
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina develop faster on any crop
under stress, so definitely yes to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the time I have left with you,
just a little bit about our research to
[SPEAKER_03]: highlight what we discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are differences in strawberry
varieties in terms of susceptibility to
[SPEAKER_03]: the macrophomina, and we're doing similar
work with this on fusarium as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just want to show you a little bit of
information here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, in this scale,
a bigger number is bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Diamante here at the bottom,
the maximum is five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamante has the 4.9 disease severity
ranking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that it's extremely decimated
by the macrophomina when you infect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the Seascape has a 2.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is significantly more tolerant to the
macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: It holds up much better, but I hasten to
add that it has a 2.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to see a 1.0 there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A 1.0 means basically no symptoms,
the plant is not affected by the
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina, and we are looking at a
resistant plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seascape is not resistant, but it is more
tolerant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it holds up better, but it is still
diseased.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this shows you that our hope is to
develop varieties that are resistant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that we would have a chance to
develop that and replace the ones that are
[SPEAKER_03]: very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob is asking, are these numbers,
the severity index numbers here related to
[SPEAKER_03]: crop load?
[SPEAKER_03]: In this particular experiment,
no.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I'll show you the next
photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a controlled experiment in a shade
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We inoculated potted strawberry plants
just to see the basic reaction to the
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus, and this does not have anything to
do with harvest fruit load or just the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit load of the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, it is strictly susceptibility of
the plant to the fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what I'm talking about,
Bob.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here is our seascape on the far right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been injected with the macrophomina
just like the other varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can see that even though they're
inoculated at the same time, the albion
[SPEAKER_03]: and ventana are much more sensitive to the
macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seascape holds up much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if I gave you the seascape plant
and you cut it open, you could see slight
[SPEAKER_03]: discoloration in the crown, meaning that
it has been infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you wait long enough, the seascape
will start to show collapse problems as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, but it will take a much longer time
to develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is kind of summarizing the work
overall in terms of some of the resistant
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's look at the column here for
macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just showed you seascape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seascape and chandler are two strawberry
varieties that are, we're calling it
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resistant does not mean immune.
[SPEAKER_03]: Immune means you don't even get infection,
but they are infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But chandler and seascape hold up much
better to macrophomina than say the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties Monterey, San Andreas,
and Ventana, which are extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible or sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other column under Fusarium,
however, the chandler and seascape
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately are very susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have both of these problems in
your field, one or the other is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get you, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you inject these plants with Fusarium,
the Monterey, San Andreas, and Ventana are
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good news, but of course as I
mentioned, they are susceptible to the
[SPEAKER_03]: macrophomina.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the unfortunate situation where
there's not yet one variety that will
[SPEAKER_02]: withstand both of the new challenges in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then finally, just to talk about
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the deal is, as I mentioned,
we're losing the methyl bromide
[SPEAKER_03]: chloropichrine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The standard methyl bromide chloropichrine
at a high rate used as a flat fume
[SPEAKER_03]: application in California to treat the
whole field, that is going out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we strongly believe that is why these
new problems are coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old traditional methyl chloropichrine
is going out, so the new pathogens are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have looked at alternative
treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The list is here to see if there's
something else that can really help us in
[SPEAKER_03]: combating these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two things to note here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, there's a lot of different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't take the time to go through this,
but a lot of different treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of three experiments we're
doing in this type of research to find an
[SPEAKER_03]: answer to these sobering problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a lot of alternatives we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, the photograph is important to
remind me to tell you, these are applied
[SPEAKER_03]: to the bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, we're getting away from
applying it to the whole field.
[SPEAKER_03]: The public opinion, the regulators,
the general direction of the world is away
[SPEAKER_03]: from using all these chemicals at high
rates and high volumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one way to address that is just to
apply it to the beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The beds are preformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're almost ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fumigation material, the fumigant
material is then injected or applied to
[SPEAKER_03]: the beds, sometimes applied through the
drips, drip irrigation that's in the bed
[SPEAKER_03]: already.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later, after time has elapsed,
the plants are put into the beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bed fumigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're applying these materials in this
system, in this bed fumigation method.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, time won't allow me to do this
or go through this individually,
[SPEAKER_03]: nor do you want me to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom line is if we saw something
that was equivalently to a methyl bromide
[SPEAKER_03]: chloropicrin traditional fumigation,
the bar would reach the number one here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but go no further.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking at trying to get something
equivalent to a level one in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: disease severity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the good news here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good news is a lot of these
alternatives, the first nine or so,
[SPEAKER_03]: control the problem quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're doing a good job at
controlling or at least knocking down
[SPEAKER_03]: populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bad news is they are not comparable to
that level one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all allow some macrophomina and some
fusarium to creep through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're continuing to see in
these fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do see dieback and collapse,
even though the field, the plots have been
[SPEAKER_03]: applied with these materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see control is number 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So over here, way on the right,
that's something that is not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have three treatments that are
about the same as a control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our situation in California,
we say none of the new alternatives,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of which can already be used,
will give you the same level of control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are seeing breakthrough in some
disease occurring despite the use of those
[SPEAKER_03]: new alternative materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I'm about done here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In summary, I've walked you through two
new soil borne issues in California for
[SPEAKER_03]: our strawberry producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are fairly recent developments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: We in California share these problems with
other places in the world and the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: But being the country's number one
strawberry producing state, we're quite
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned about these new problems caused
by macrophomina and fusarium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope I made my case to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A precise field diagnosis is not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're in a different state and you
begin to see dieback issues in your
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries, I encourage you to,
again, locate your friendly neighborhood
[SPEAKER_03]: plant pathologist or someone qualified to
help you with diagnosis because it will
[SPEAKER_03]: take laboratory testing to confirm what
you've got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the way things happen in our
country and our world with movement of
[SPEAKER_03]: materials and such, you likely will see
some new disease at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not these two, but something in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are something you'll see,
you'll be likely to be concerned like we
[SPEAKER_03]: are that these are going to be persistent
problems that will need to be dealt with
[SPEAKER_03]: in a long-term strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, really, excuse me, there's
really nothing new in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be similar to what we do for other
soil borne problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went through that with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically nothing new there,
but something that will have to be applied
[SPEAKER_03]: now to new issues, at least for
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, like Tracy before me, I also want to
acknowledge and thank a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially the strawberry growers in my
state of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a very nice industry group,
the California Strawberry Commission
[SPEAKER_03]: that's funded our research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's lots of people who have
helped us with the project as well as our
[SPEAKER_03]: research team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really want to acknowledge all those
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I really want to thank Cathy
and the organizers for allowing me to
[SPEAKER_03]: share this with you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I will pass this back to
Cathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much, Steve and
Tracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there questions for either of our
speakers?
[SPEAKER_01]: While you're thinking about that,
thank you for participating today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind you that the second in
the series on emerging pest ID and
[SPEAKER_01]: management will be next Friday afternoon
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have Dr. Robert Martin, who's going
to be talking to us about strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mr. Mark Bolda, who's going to be
talking to us about management of spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: winged astrophila in small fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're waiting for questions,
I also want to point out to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, the box is not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I have posted the first two
recordings online and they are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be editing last week and this
week's webinars hopefully this afternoon
[SPEAKER_01]: and have those posted sometime early next
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here goes somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, no questions yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the link for the webinar
recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if there are no questions,
thanks again, speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate your participation
and we'll see all of you next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Cathy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thanks, Cathy.
