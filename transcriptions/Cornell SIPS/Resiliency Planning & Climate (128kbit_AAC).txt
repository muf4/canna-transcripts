[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Kimberly Davis with Florida A&M
Corporative Extension, and I am the
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension Disaster Education Specialist,
as well as the CRD program leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my focus of today's topic is going to
be building climate resiliency through
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster preparedness education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in the state of Florida,
so you know what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida ranks in the top five among those
that have a lot of billion-dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: disasters every year and a lot of
disasters, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far this year, we have truly been
slammed with hurricanes and tornadoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why one of the things that we
focus on is building disaster resiliency
[SPEAKER_00]: through preparedness, because we know that
a lot of the disasters that we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: now, they are really a result of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we have extreme flooding,
extreme heat events, extreme drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to focus on training our
citizens how to be better prepared and
[SPEAKER_00]: more resilient to respond to the various
disasters that they may face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a snapshot of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this corner, these are all really
happened in this area, because we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really been slammed in Tallahassee,
but this year we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a flooding event that happened
not far away from campus earlier in
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really student housing around the
corner from FAMU's campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the hurricanes that we had
that happened down in Taylor County,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 50 miles from campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tornado that hit campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hurricane that happened in
neighboring county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a wildfire that occurred in
central Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these all happen in vulnerable and
at-risk areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that we focus
on at Florida A&M Extension is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: work with communities that need a little
bit more help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we do disaster
preparedness education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do environmental and conservation
education and community resilience and
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that we think help to
build resiliency in communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you need to be prepared for
disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are better stewards of the
environment, you lessen the impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talk to our communities about
things that they can do to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: resilient, such as resiliency and
mitigation planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the main programs that we have
is the FAMU Extension Disaster
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparedness Education and Safety Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this program is really to work with
our vulnerable communities, our youth,
[SPEAKER_00]: our families, our seniors, small farms,
and businesses when it comes to disaster
[SPEAKER_00]: preparedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to reduce the vulnerability of
these citizens when it comes to natural
[SPEAKER_00]: hazards and emergencies through an
enhanced all preparedness education
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to increase their ability to
prepare for, respond to, recover from,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mitigate against natural disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we offer programming in all those
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that they have
safe communities and homes, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: real important when it comes to being
resilient to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we promote preparedness throughout the
entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Florida, something can happen any
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that we are
prepared for anything in any month,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the photo that I showed you of the
tornado, that happened in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't expecting, Tallahassee had
never really been hit by a severe tornado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that with the changes that we
have in our weather, anything is possible
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made us more alert in Tallahassee,
because before coming to FAMU,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually the state environmental
scientist for emergency management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never thought about tornadoes,
even though we prepare for disasters
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the state, but it was rare that
Tallahassee would have the magnitude of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tornado that they had back in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pictures that I did show you,
those happened in the most vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: areas in our city of Tallahassee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, that occurred in
what is known as zip code 323.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is in the capital of Florida,
that is the poorest zip code in the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would think that the poorest zip code
would be in the capital, but it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason why we focus on
that programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that zip code is really within walking
distance to our campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have funded projects to do this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jennifer said that we're
volunteers, but volunteers need money too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have funded projects that help us
with our programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a USDA grant in 1890 capacity
building grant, building community
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience to strengthen capacity to
climate change and natural disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a Southern SARE grant,
which is targeted towards small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a NIFA rapid response grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is, is as a storm happens,
NIFA has rapid response monies available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is using, we're using photo voice
to go into communities to see how they are
[SPEAKER_00]: recovering, connecting and healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do two programs that are
targeted towards youth and teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the FAMU Summer Sea Science and
Environmental Education Academy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funded through Mississippi State
for a grant they received from NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have strengthening forestry and
conservation education, which is funded by
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA Forest Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disaster preparedness and safety
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deliver programming that focuses on the
five facets of emergency management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's prevention, preparedness,
response, recovery, and mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focus primarily on youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Families, seniors, and small scale
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember a family is also a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just focus on everyone that needs to
be prepared, especially those in socially
[SPEAKER_00]: economically challenged urban and rural
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in emergency management, there are five
phases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is prevention and that's gonna be
those actions that you take to avoid the
[SPEAKER_00]: incident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do do things to help with
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prevention may be something simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may not see it as a climate related,
but a mass shooting, being able to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: and what to do when it comes that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have preparedness, which are those
plans that you do immediately before
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster occurs, such as getting your
emergency kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the response phase,
which is immediate actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recovery, which are those long-term
actions after the storm and mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mitigation is really where you are
building that resiliency because
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation are those long-term actions
that you can take, such as when you live
[SPEAKER_00]: in a flooded area, one of those long-term
actions may be simply to get your home
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about building
resilience and you think about mitigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we work with vulnerable
populations, we teach them those things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can do that may have a lower
cost because it costs a lot to mitigate
[SPEAKER_00]: your home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some things that you can do
that are more cost efficient for
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you live in a wind-prone area,
you may just use plywood to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, we do an energy efficiency
because I am the CRD program leader,
[SPEAKER_00]: and under our CRD program, we do energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that you
can do, especially for extreme heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding energy efficiency and energy
efficient measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So FEMA defines resilience to disasters as
community resilience, the ability for the
[SPEAKER_00]: community to prepare for anticipated
hazards, adapt to changing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and withstand and recover rapidly from
disruptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why emergency preparedness and
disaster preparedness is important because
[SPEAKER_00]: you want communities to be able to respond
quicker than they would if they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared because we know disasters cause
so many different things, health-related,
[SPEAKER_00]: social, economic, and environmental
conditions that weaken the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that a weakened community also
can't withstand the climate change as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important that we are
working with our communities and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year, FEMA does a national
household survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the survey that really caught my
attention and the one that I like to use
[SPEAKER_00]: in my presentations is the one from 2021
because we have been doing a better job at
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the one that was really the
catalyst to us doing disaster preparedness
[SPEAKER_00]: and resiliency because we found that there
are differing needs for historically
[SPEAKER_00]: underserved communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned a few minutes ago,
we want to promote low-cost ways to bridge
[SPEAKER_00]: the gap for those that are
socioeconomically disadvantaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the things that in this
survey that really stuck out that when
[SPEAKER_00]: they surveyed homeowners and renters,
a lot of them responded saying that there
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be a way that they can prepare at
low-cost ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I mentioned, if you're flooded,
one of the things is elevating your homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing is actually getting your
home acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just think about if your home is
acquired out of the flood zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to worry about, did I have
enough equity in my home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it's enough to buy another home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I be able to or do I have to rent?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are things that you have to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think about and work through with
our communities when it comes to building
[SPEAKER_00]: resiliency, because some things may work
for other communities, but for
[SPEAKER_00]: historically underserved communities,
those things just don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we do for
preparedness is that we work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: youth because what does a child do?
[SPEAKER_00]: A child will simply go home and say,
hey, mom, hey, dad, guess what I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, grandma, I learned that these are the
different clouds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one of the photos, this is just
teaching kids about the different clouds
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can understand, well, when I see
this cloud, especially a nimble cumulus
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud, then I think I need to go inside
because it's going to be some severe
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then duck and cover, teaching them
just when there's a tornado, they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to duck and cover how tornadoes
are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we teach them those things using a STEM
approach so that when we're teaching them
[SPEAKER_00]: STEM, we're teaching them the science
behind storms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, as I mentioned, we have the
FAMU-C program, which is our C science
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really focusing on, for example,
one of the activities that we do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: kids was how can you protect your home
from extreme heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do an activity where the kids design
a home that can withstand extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kinds of materials a home would
need for extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that we do
with our youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, when they get home,
hopefully the activities are exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: that once they do them, we tell them why
it happens and what you can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they go back and share that with
their adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because youth are really, really important
when it comes to preparedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I started out as a FAMU 4-H agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 4-H and youth program is very dear to
my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working with our children and making
sure that they understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, we also teach them how
to environmental stewardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We teach them about single use of
plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this goes into our preparedness
because we know that plastics are a big
[SPEAKER_00]: driver to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, another thing that
we're doing with our youth is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching them about to just get the food
that you're going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that a lot of food goes to
the landfills and that creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: methane gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we teach the kids, just get what you're
going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just those simple things when we
are doing preparedness in these classes
[SPEAKER_00]: with our kids that we're helping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we talking about disaster
preparedness, but we're also talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental stewardship and
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is that when we're working
with our adults, we do a lot of community
[SPEAKER_00]: workshops on preparedness, especially with
our seniors and our single moms,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of preparedness workshops and
we do community resiliency planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with communities that need to
understand what are the flood zones in
[SPEAKER_00]: your community?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different risks in your
community?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they understand that, they can
better prepare and do mitigation planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because under FEMA, every state has a
mitigation plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make sure that communities
understand that everyone's a part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state has a mitigation plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if your community does mitigation
planning, you can help your community
[SPEAKER_00]: better withstand disasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing about our building
resiliency is changing the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to change the threat, change the
impact, and change their survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the end of my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one question from Kareem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can the curriculum used with adults and
youth be shared with us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention I am a part of the
Extension Disaster Education Network,
[SPEAKER_00]: EDEN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the curricula that we use,
we make sure that we post the curricula on
[SPEAKER_00]: the EDEN website, and I'll post it in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go to EDEN because you're
Extension and you can get anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the information, of course,
because we're Extension and we share
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, it's really where you can put
your logo on it and tell it to your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is the EDEN website and the youth
curricula that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: FEMA has a program called STEP,
so I'll put that in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did with STEP, I worked on the
actual STEP part, but Illinois Extension
[SPEAKER_00]: made STEP into a 4-H program book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're 4-H, there is a 4-H program
book for disaster preparedness as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will put the link for EDEN in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that STEP 4-H program guide is on the
EDEN website as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question, which is from CJ Kelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kim, have you noticed pushback from folks
who do not believe in the driving forces
[SPEAKER_03]: of these disasters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because I'm in the state of
Florida, there are certain words that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use and we don't use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think because, like I said,
when Tallahassee got slammed and the areas
[SPEAKER_00]: that got slammed that are getting slammed,
I think there's been a wake-up call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had the pushback that I
thought I would have, which has been good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I go into a workshop,
I do go in with that mindset, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there's going to be a denier in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't had that pushback yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim, that was a wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to be looking at some
of those resources you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Megan Krueger, and I am an
evaluation and research specialist at West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia University, but also serve as an
environmental educator in some capacities.
[SPEAKER_02]: My presentation today is going to go over
a grant-funded project that we have right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, which is called Preparing Agents of
Change for Tomorrow, Building Youth
[SPEAKER_02]: Confidence and Capacity for Climate
Resilient Futures.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the catalyst of this project was a
major natural disaster flooding event that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened in West Virginia on June 23,
2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a thousand-year flood, which was
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was caused by a storm that delivered
about a quarter of the state's annual
[SPEAKER_02]: rainfall in just 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had over a billion dollars in
damages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see some of the other sad
impacts of that storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: This storm took a lot of people by
surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these damages that happened were
really highlighting some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: vulnerabilities that we have in West
Virginia and Appalachia and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: under-resourced communities that we have,
especially in the southern part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of social vulnerability,
a lot of issues with infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this flood just really highlighted a
lot of those problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are two photos from that flooding
event that happened on that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see just how much water was dumped
in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've been to West Virginia,
you'll know that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: valleys, and these valleys have rivers
that run through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can put people at extreme risk
when these flooding events happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know, based on some research being
done in the state from our university,
[SPEAKER_02]: that flooding is expected to get worse in
West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen predictions that because of
climate change and increased temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we will have increased precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see on the image on my left
anyway, it's the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Risk Factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just shows where people are most at
risk for flood damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see this dark blue area is
where West Virginia is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we are not a coastal area,
we still have a lot of risk of riverine
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding and flash flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is expected to get worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have this county map here,
where you can see the percent change of
[SPEAKER_02]: properties that are at risk for flooding
by 2050 compared to 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see some of our counties are
at 40% more properties are at risk for
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: West Virginia University is up here in
this part of the state, but we work with
[SPEAKER_02]: Extension in all counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really looking at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, despite West Virginia being one of
the most flood prone states, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant lack of preparedness for these
environmental challenges, especially as
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding is getting worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know based on surveys and
opinion maps and Yale climate opinion maps
[SPEAKER_02]: that over half of our state are having
some issues with denial with existence of
[SPEAKER_02]: global warming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does complicate efforts to build
community resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our solution was this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a funding opportunity from NOAA's
Environmental Literacy Office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we developed a partnership between
Extension at West Virginia University and
[SPEAKER_02]: two other labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the Mountain Hydrology Lab,
which is out of our forestry college.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one is out of our geography college,
which is a resilient communities lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: which had originally been working on food
deserts, but now has also been working on
[SPEAKER_02]: climate related disaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Preparing Agents for Change for
Tomorrow is in one sentence summary is a
[SPEAKER_02]: comprehensive initiative to enhance
climate resilience through youth education
[SPEAKER_02]: and engagement across West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first kind of statewide
initiative we've had to build resilience
[SPEAKER_02]: to flooding in West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of this project, which was
funded about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're about halfway through it is to
really build confidence and capacity for
[SPEAKER_02]: flood preparedness and resilience
planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our idea is that if we build
self-efficacy in youth, confidence in
[SPEAKER_02]: youth and hope that we will increase
youth's climate literacy and resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a comprehensive theory of change,
which is one document that really was
[SPEAKER_02]: provided to us by NOAA that is available
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna be in the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great document and anyone can adapt
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did is we took NOAA's theory of
change that they put out to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, try and adapt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For your state, see how you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This theory of change is supposed to,
in essence, build resilience in
[SPEAKER_02]: communities through a couple different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pathway that you can build is
dependent on where you are and what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're choosing this pathway of youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is our adaptation of the
theory of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So youth go through three tiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The top tier, tier one is where we get
most of our youth in.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is done through an in-school
programming through extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our extension system has a really great
robust school enrichment where extension
[SPEAKER_02]: agents go into the schools, teach about
different things, agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: STEM, so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this tier one mirrors that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in tier one, youth are in the
schools and they're taught through a
[SPEAKER_02]: five-day program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see some of the outcomes that
we aim to reach in this tier one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to increase their awareness of
vulnerabilities in their community,
[SPEAKER_02]: of hazards in their community,
of climate change itself, of how
[SPEAKER_02]: communities can be more resilient,
and just even basic things such as
[SPEAKER_02]: watershed dynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after they go through this first
tier of programming, they're invited into
[SPEAKER_02]: the second tier, which is smaller,
of course, because not everybody will
[SPEAKER_02]: choose to join.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those that do will be trained by
people on our team and graduate students
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand how to actually map
vulnerabilities in their community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will co-create vulnerability
assessments in their communities and then
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate that to others in their
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final tier three,
which is where we'll probably have the
[SPEAKER_02]: smallest amount of youth participation,
but the most meaningful, if you think
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, is that the youth will go
through a leadership summit, and we are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to train them on leadership,
communication, and then have them present
[SPEAKER_02]: their ideas and some of their concerns
about their community's vulnerability to
[SPEAKER_02]: the state government during a legislative
day, which we have each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we hope to continue mentoring
them to become decision-makers around
[SPEAKER_02]: building community resilience and kind of
really, in essence, making a peer network
[SPEAKER_02]: of youth throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have similar interests and want to be
these kind of change-makers in their
[SPEAKER_02]: community and assist with reducing impact
of flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've already created the curriculum
for that tier one that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is an in-school five-day curriculum
that is for high school students.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've already piloted it in two high
schools and have some good results so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: The five classes kind of move a student
from understanding floods and waterways
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way into understanding hope and
resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the first class, we kind of
introduce them to their watershed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's surprising that a lot of them
don't know what their watershed is or
[SPEAKER_02]: really like what water is even around
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do an activity to map what's
upstream of them and what's downstream of
[SPEAKER_02]: them to really kind of place them in where
they are in their watershed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that through some different
visualizations that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go back the next day and we
really kind of do more of a science heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: lesson on the science behind floods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk a lot about riverine and flash
flooding, and we visualize rainfall using
[SPEAKER_02]: Legos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was an activity we adapted
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory called
[SPEAKER_02]: Precipa Towers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this one, students actually look at
real data that was collected in West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia about annual precipitation from
the past 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they build Lego towers to show how
much precipitation was for each year and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the average.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then they can see in the past 10 to
15 years how much physically that Lego
[SPEAKER_02]: towers is towering over that average
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had really good feedback on that
because it's something hands on that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can do and helps them understand like,
how do we even know where this data is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: We also look at some simulators of like,
what's the difference between flash flood
[SPEAKER_02]: and riverine flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third class, we're talking
about place-based information in West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you know your risk as an
individual person or an individual
[SPEAKER_02]: community?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we talk about how we identify
vulnerable people in places, using FEMA
[SPEAKER_02]: resources and how to understand like,
what happens if there's a flood?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I at risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some tools we use where they
can put their address in on their
[SPEAKER_02]: Chromebooks and see like, are they in a
flood zone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were and they didn't even
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the fourth one, after we've kind
of scared them a little bit, not
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally, but they're like,
oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talk about preparing and responding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we talk a lot about flood safety
tips, like what do you absolutely not do
[SPEAKER_02]: during a flooding event?
[SPEAKER_02]: What should you do during a flood event?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you be prepared?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we give them a list to start
building a household emergency kit for
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last class is kind of
building that hope and resilience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a story map published by
Kentucky Red Cross, where they did an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing job at showing kind of how that
community responded to the 2022 floods and
[SPEAKER_02]: going through all the different things,
community level engagement, neighbors,
[SPEAKER_02]: helping neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about how you can be a helper
and how community plays a role in building
[SPEAKER_02]: resilience in your neighbors and your
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the pilot of tier one,
which we've done twice now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've also piloted that tier two
I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is more intensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually starts as a whole weekend
workshop and the students come to campus
[SPEAKER_02]: and they come for two and a half days and
they really learn a lot about mapping
[SPEAKER_02]: community vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go through different activities like
mental mapping, family mapping,
[SPEAKER_02]: mapping environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, community mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They walk around campus and they start
identifying where they think, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: this could be a risk for flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's erosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's water coming over the road,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also start understanding
vulnerability through the built
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and social vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference between our
vulnerabilities in the built environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and what kind of preexisting social
vulnerabilities are going to make those
[SPEAKER_02]: things even worse?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're evaluating the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're evaluating the outcomes of the
program and the youth participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're measuring their levels of hope
around climate and natural disasters at
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning and the end, trying to see
where they are on this hope spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they feeling despair?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they feeling hopeful?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're also measuring their
self-efficacy, confidence, around being
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared for flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, their knowledge
increase on climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping that eventually we'll be able
to see some intergenerational learning
[SPEAKER_02]: taking place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to see some of this knowledge
we're partaking on the youth to their
[SPEAKER_02]: parents or their caregivers, changes in
knowledge, attitudes and behaviors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have about two more years left on
the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to finalize the curriculum,
run the program consistently over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're hoping to make it sustainable by
branding it as an extension program that's
[SPEAKER_02]: offered via train the trainer workshops
where any extension educator in the state
[SPEAKER_02]: could go and take this program and do it
in their county.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already seeing really good feedback
so far, but I will keep talking about this
[SPEAKER_02]: as we learn more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you try to assess hope, how do you
connect that to doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, in other words, you're trying to
assess it, but then you're also,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's kind of like one of those
things you never really want to leave
[SPEAKER_03]: open-ended, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you kind of want to like prompt it
and then you want to take it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you taking it forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jack, if you could start sharing your
screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you mean taking it forward,
like continuing the conversation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Continuing the conversation, but also
enabling and like an empowered action,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, figuring out where they
are at in their hope spectrum and then
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to connect it to a doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're in the process of
creating an instrument and we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: testing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is some validated scales on hope,
but none that we found specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: related to flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now what we're doing is
adapting a scale to measure hope around
[SPEAKER_02]: flooding, flooding and natural disaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're testing it to see if it's
measuring effectively, doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: different statistical tests on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that once we get to that
point, we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: conceptualize how people fall in that
scale and where they fall and if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like low hope versus medium hope versus
high hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that will only come after we
keep developing this instrument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we're not giving them that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of just testing it as of right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's four open questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I miss that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you have a time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a timeline for when you hope
the T2T will be available to corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: extension personnel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Train the trainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, train the trainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, we don't yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are working with Eden.
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally got delegates now for Eden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once our curriculum is finished,
we plan to upload it onto there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna start train the trainer in
West Virginia first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it works well, we would be
open to doing it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Kim, if you could find the adult
curriculum as well as the step curriculum
[SPEAKER_03]: link.
[SPEAKER_03]: Karim, I think I put the step in the
answered Q&A, but you're asking
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically for the adult curriculum for
Eden in Florida, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my name is Jack Voight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a senior in environmental engineering
here at NC State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just finished up my semester and I also
do some research in the coastal
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering department and I'm from the
coast as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these issues, they strike home
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this summer I had the opportunity to
work for a new initiative called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Coastal Community Resilience Immersive
Training Program or C-CRIP for short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really a huge collaboration
between AmeriCorps provided funding,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Coastal Resilience and Sustainability
Initiative here at NC State and the Kenan
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute of Engineering and Technology
also here at NC State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a really big initiative and we
got to go out and work with a local
[SPEAKER_01]: county, Jones County, which was really
great in terms of giving back to a local
[SPEAKER_01]: community after I've been kind of doing
this work here at NC State all through the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to quickly highlight the
team we had here because as I'm presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: to you today, there was five other
undergraduate students who worked with me
[SPEAKER_01]: and the whole body of our work that we
went through really wouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_01]: possible without having these six
undergraduate students all working
[SPEAKER_01]: together in a team towards one goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big part of how we're able
to gather so much data and how we were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to engage the community so frequently
going down and frequent visits every week
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout this 10 week program we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our approach, we were aiming to follow
the model of a North Carolina Division of
[SPEAKER_01]: Coastal Management Program called the
Resilient Coastal Communities Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this program essentially is just a
four-phase program that aims to create on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground construction projects that can
tackle climate problems or flooding
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this has got to do with
stormwater and increasing capacity for
[SPEAKER_01]: areas that this money probably wouldn't be
in the works for a while if they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: able to facilitate the funds to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our aim was to do this for a community
that was not part of the Kama,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Coastal Area Management Act or Kama,
as this RCCP program only applies to those
[SPEAKER_01]: Kama counties that you can see outlined
here in green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jones County, even though it's not
part of Kama, it is only 50 miles away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the coast and they've had some severe
impacts from hurricanes recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like a really great start to
aim our project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only part of this four-phase
program that we were doing was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: phase, obviously, as we were not quite
getting out there and getting shovels
[SPEAKER_01]: dirty yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our approach, we reviewed existing
documents that we gathered from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like land use plans,
anything essentially that Jones County had
[SPEAKER_01]: already had in the recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we developed a community
engagement strategy in terms of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how are we gonna go out there
and approach the community and how are we
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna take that, the feedback they give us
and taking an account into our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that, we wanted to identify and
map all the critical assets, natural
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure and some of the socially
vulnerable populations within the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also wanted to conduct the risk and
vulnerability assessment that was the aim
[SPEAKER_01]: of that phase one of the RCCP that I
showed you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our deliverables, there was two final
deliverables that we finished with,
[SPEAKER_01]: one was the risk and vulnerability
assessment that I talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: the aims to kind of be that phase one of
RCCP that Jones County can now go use in
[SPEAKER_01]: applying for some of these grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also wanted to make a more
consumable media that we made an ArcGIS
[SPEAKER_01]: story map.
[SPEAKER_01]: This map kind of starts out with some
cultural assets to really highlight some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the key areas that we heard from Jones
County people were very important to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as going into some of the data
about the flooding issues that has
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a quick assets overview, we were able
to really get a large quantity of assets
[SPEAKER_01]: with the six undergraduate students we
had, and we're all engineering students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all very interested in statistics
and different ways to manipulate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just using ArcGIS and different tools
to really, you know, do whatever we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can think of doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some of the basic things that we
were able to quantify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jones County is a very agricultural
county, even though it's close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So productive land and its ability to grow
crops is with a huge emphasis on some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these during these flood events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is us meeting with some local
government officials with initially on
[SPEAKER_01]: June 3rd with Dr. Georgina Sanchez and Dr.
Rebecca Ward, our advisors who kind of led
[SPEAKER_01]: us through this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically got a crash course on the
entire Jones County history that day and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically got up to date immediately
with the state of it and kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: sentiment that people had about the storm,
even six years later, as Hurricane
[SPEAKER_01]: Florence was the main storm that people
seemed to be worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that occurred all the way back in
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we immediately got invited again a
couple of weeks later to exercise a
[SPEAKER_01]: hurricane exercise, which is basically a
block hurricane where the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Center came and kind of walked
through all the local officials on how,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how the reports go out,
how they should take into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the emergency manager is essentially
assigning jobs to all the different local
[SPEAKER_01]: officials in emergency management time,
because Jones County is a rather small
[SPEAKER_01]: county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the local officials have to
wear multiple hats in the sense that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be prepared to be emergency
management facilitators in some way when
[SPEAKER_01]: these events occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also got to speak in front of the
board of commissioners meeting to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce ourselves to the county in a
more broad sense and try to try to be good
[SPEAKER_01]: stewards and local champions in the sense
that we were there to serve the public and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, gain feedback and put that into
this report.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also surveyed local residents at two
different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was just a restaurant called Aggies
Pizza and Sub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened to be near a lot of the
town offices that we had initially gone
[SPEAKER_01]: out and met at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we went in there to get some food
the first time, we realized that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably one of the higher foot traffic
areas in the entirety of Jones County and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the few restaurants that remained
open after this storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we realized we could, you know,
gain some feedback from the community
[SPEAKER_01]: there and take that into account for our
report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also wanted to get different senses
of more vulnerable communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also sent out a couple of
coordinators to survey people at the
[SPEAKER_01]: filling station, which is a nonprofit,
which is giving out food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just wanted to get as broad of a
resident pool as we could and taking into
[SPEAKER_01]: account as much feedback as we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some of what we heard from the
residents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked them what they thought was the
most important or they were most worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about out of all these either
environmental hazards or community assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see schools was the main community
asset people worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just shortly behind public safety
in the emergency mental services.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then flooding and hurricanes was
clearly the kind of runaway environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: hazard, which we kind of expected coming
in after hearing the stories about
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Florence back in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's just a couple of pictures from
Hurricane Florence.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in Polluxville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that man right there is walking across
the bridge that you can see here to the
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geological Survey meters over 20 feet of
flooding above the normal water crest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a extreme event, 500 year
flood, as they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll kind of get into later why what a
lot of our work does is breaking down what
[SPEAKER_01]: that 500 year flood means and how we can
kind of move forward as extension
[SPEAKER_01]: coordinators and science communicators
better and communicators in this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is just some of the data that we
compiled from different reports and
[SPEAKER_01]: satellite imagery and FEMA floodplain
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Hurricane Matthew, which was two
years before Florence and Florence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just essentially use this data to
take addresses, different critical assets
[SPEAKER_01]: that we found and mapped and kind of see
where they were in the storm extents and
[SPEAKER_01]: the floodplain extents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing this allowed us to really think
about the differences between these things
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of communicate some of the maybe
the misunderstandings and flood data that
[SPEAKER_01]: people will have when they're on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our main messages was
floodplains, they flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's a 100 year floodplain,
it's only supposed to have a one percent
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of annual flooding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that communicating a 26 percent
chance of flooding over a 30 year mortgage
[SPEAKER_01]: is a bit more effective in terms of
describing what this really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that FEMA floodplains are
created is because they flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to make sure that just
because, you know, it hasn't flooded this
[SPEAKER_01]: often and this is, oh, this is the first
time your house has flooded in a
[SPEAKER_01]: floodplain, you know, these were created
because they're flood and they're a low
[SPEAKER_01]: lying area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond the floodplain as well,
we wanted to quantify kind of differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between the floodplain and like this 250
meter buffer zone just outside because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that really kind of breaks down the
issues in development and discussions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to quantify that even
though there is not a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure within the floodplain,
you can see almost a third of police
[SPEAKER_01]: stations, addresses and buildings in
general and over that of productive land
[SPEAKER_01]: was inside that 250 meter buffer zone,
which really kind of illustrates the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that we have as Hurricane Florence
extends outside of the floodplain and way
[SPEAKER_01]: into that 250 meter buffer zone and maybe
even beyond that at certain points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I want to discuss quickly
was buyouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: FEMA buyouts was a big part of discussion
and a big point of contention,
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Jones County, 111 people sought
buyouts, which was the most in the state
[SPEAKER_01]: during this Hurricane Florence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are the fourth least populous
county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of issues with FEMA
buyouts in terms of if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: deed available, if you're not owning the
property, there's just some stipulations
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sense of who gets the buyouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, this is a small county and
decreasing that tax base and property
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes is a huge hit in terms of the income
they're making each year and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: spending to make it a more resilient
future for the Jones County residents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quickly, I wanted to show this map
because I think there was a nice story
[SPEAKER_01]: with this map and I was really excited
about making this at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Polluxville and I kind of
overlapped the floodplain and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Matthew extent and Hurricane
Florence extent and then both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was really excited about this map
and I thought it might provide really good
[SPEAKER_01]: data for some people down there on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I sent this map to the mayor of
Polluxville and he told me that while the
[SPEAKER_01]: Florence data was actually not quite as
large as it should have been, as the
[SPEAKER_01]: satellite imagery was taking a couple of
days after peak flooding, the Hurricane
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew data actually overextended and
showed too much damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only a couple of houses that
actually have water inundate their homes
[SPEAKER_01]: and damage anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the flooding imagery from Matthew
actually was relatively overestimated in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the way it's shown on this map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to kind of share that and show
the importance of creating community
[SPEAKER_01]: connections because without that I might
have just gone along and thought this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: great map and I can't wait to show it to
everybody and tell everybody this is
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was able to ground truth it by
sending it directly to the mayor of
[SPEAKER_01]: Polluxville.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that worked out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the final map I created and we
took a step back in terms of including all
[SPEAKER_01]: the addresses and kind of focusing more on
these critical assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also put in the 500 year floodplain
here because that was something we heard a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 500 year floodplain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 500 year storm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of wanted to show that this
flood extended to the 500 year floodplain
[SPEAKER_01]: and some points beyond it seems like from
some of the imagery and videos that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: gathered from this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while 500 year floodplain,
it's not a storm that's gonna happen very
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: With increasing uncertainties and the
climate future and lack of different
[SPEAKER_01]: flooding issues being accounted for in
these floodplains, they shouldn't be the
[SPEAKER_01]: end all be all in terms of understanding a
floodplain and how you accept and take the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there needs to be a lot more
research and ground truthing in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: communicating how these floods are gonna
go ahead in the future and what the work
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to do to ensure that people are
safe and understand some of the risks that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack, before you leave the screen,
can you go back one image or maybe two
[SPEAKER_03]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you ground truth, first of all,
yay, congrats.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you ground truth with the mayor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But didn't you say that actually the
Florence was expanded further?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I included this image up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this image up here, up here where
my cursor is right here, that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: schools that you can see over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't see it in the imagery here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is water on those schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was up to three feet,
I believe, of water in those schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had they had to build a brand new
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they got into those
schools, there was mold growing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was kind of a way of me being
having to step back and say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sometimes it's easy to overlook
and not realize, oh, yeah, that was taken
[SPEAKER_01]: two days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's clouds over the peak flooding
day, and they weren't able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: satellite imagery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really kind of a great
experience in terms of understanding the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of community engagement,
and how that can really create like a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback loop in terms of research and
also education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and Megan has a question in the chat
or Mara.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Mara has a question in the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Asking about lidar maps and the role in
the 500 year floodplain delineation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not really sure if exactly how
the 500 year floodplains are created
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked too directly into that in the
lidar maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's I'm not exactly sure
if they account for the different
[SPEAKER_01]: hurricane precipitation, all the different
flood effects, because we heard ground
[SPEAKER_01]: truth in the ground that the river that
this Trent River flows into where a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the flooding comes from, that river was
flowing backwards during Hurricane Flores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that, you know,
I'm modeling, I'm doing a lot of coastal
[SPEAKER_01]: modeling myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even sure where how you start to
model that and how you take into account
[SPEAKER_01]: wind tides, hurricane, you know,
the hurricane vortex winds in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how you take all that into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's something that we have to
communicate and be honest, as modelers
[SPEAKER_01]: that models aren't always correct,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm gonna ask another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you had your magic ball,
or actually your magic wand, how would you
[SPEAKER_03]: reorganize the FEMA buyout so that because
all the spots you showed look like they
[SPEAKER_03]: needed to be bought out period,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so I mean, it's not for lack of
logic for buying them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what would be your one sort of policy
drive or wish for making that a more
[SPEAKER_03]: equitable system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard, because, you know, I understand
the need for deeds and these things to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that, you know, people aren't,
you know, trying to take advantage of this
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in general, there just needs
to be more, maybe competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that there's some buyouts
were facilitated by the NC office in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brazilian Sea, and maybe just more
programs besides FEMA to maybe even just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, try to make them compete and
make it easier for people to facilitate
[SPEAKER_01]: buyouts if they really want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, at the end of the day,
I kind of was thinking about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also talked to the county
manager and realized, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: buyouts really can't be the end all be all
when you're in a really small populous
[SPEAKER_01]: county, because they need to get money so
they can make more resilient, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think there's really a good
answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in general, there needs to be
it needs to be easier for people to get
[SPEAKER_01]: money in these disaster events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't have to struggle and,
you know, go through this over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody else have any other questions
either from the panel or in the chat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, I want to thank you all for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks especially to Jack,
Kim and Megan for presenting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The recordings will be up approximately
seven days from now from on the NECI
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put it in the link.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish you all a very warm and festive
next month and be looking for our events
[SPEAKER_03]: on the third Wednesday of the month at
2pm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope everybody is well.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
