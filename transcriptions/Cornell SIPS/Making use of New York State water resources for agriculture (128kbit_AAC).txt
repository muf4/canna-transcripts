[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my background is in hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this talk is mostly hydrology with some
kind of agronomy and agriculture thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: in, just so you kind of know what
perspective I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the project, I've been working
on this with a grad student, Sherry
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin, who's here, and then also Dr.
Theresa Selfa, who's at SUNY ESF.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a rural sociologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of us actually have at least one
Cornell degree, so I guess it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: pedigree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of just some background on the
project, so this is funded by USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two years ago almost, they had a new
program come out, the Water for
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture Challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the context of it was 2013,
2014, and clearly a lot of the motivation
[SPEAKER_00]: was because of the drought out west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was sort of contemplating,
is there anything to propose, can you
[SPEAKER_00]: really come up with anything as compelling
as what's going on out west?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question that kind of occurred to
me and I think have occurred to other
[SPEAKER_00]: people is, what is the potential if it's
harder to sustain agriculture out west to
[SPEAKER_00]: shift agriculture back east?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like a reasonable question
to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the idea of the intended impact of
the Water for Agriculture Challenge is to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure quantity and availability of water
supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want more water out west,
why don't you take your agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere where you actually have water?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a few other questions arise with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing, so I was just looking at
some papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of a climatology paper,
looking at water supply in the west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just someone mapping out
reservoir storage in the Colorado River
[SPEAKER_00]: Basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically storage in Lake Powell,
Lake Mead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the black line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're tracking that from 2005 to
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the green line, so from 2005 to
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, what they also did
is they also looked at groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way they looked at groundwater is
they used what's called GRACE,
[SPEAKER_00]: the GRACE program from NASA, which is the
satellite program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks at small changes in the
gravimetric field of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they can do is they can detect at
a regional scale changes in groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting thing with this graph is
they basically saw 2010, 2011,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are concerned that Lake Mead might
go dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically recovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they continue to see is they see
groundwater levels go down and stay down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of suggests a few sort of
interesting things related to my project
[SPEAKER_00]: and also Western Water, which is one is
that the drought has probably to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree impacted Western Water production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the other degree, it's Western
production of agriculture has to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree probably been mitigated by reliance
on groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we sort of look at 10, 20 years out
when that groundwater isn't there,
[SPEAKER_00]: will there be a more obvious need for
shifting things somewhere else?
[SPEAKER_00]: The third thing that it does in terms of
some perspective for thinking about New
[SPEAKER_00]: York is it highlights the fact that even
out West where there's these irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: districts and well-known Basie is a
definite need for managing water,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been gaps in terms of
understanding and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that big gap has been in groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have been drawing down
groundwater Basie because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations there to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Basie parallels New York in the sense
of in New York, it's sort of been free
[SPEAKER_00]: rain in terms of non-potable water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about this in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until only about three years ago,
there were Basie no restrictions in most
[SPEAKER_00]: of New York, not in the Susquehanna River
Basin, Delaware River Basin, but
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a non-potable water user,
so a golf course, a farmer, you Basie
[SPEAKER_00]: could take as much water as you wanted,
never had to report it and never had to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to some degree, New York is sort of in
the place where the West has been with
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater is we really don't know very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is sort of the motivated,
the two questions of this work is can we
[SPEAKER_00]: shift agriculture back East?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do that and do we need water to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we Basie been using more water for
agriculture than we think in the East and
[SPEAKER_00]: in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we actually know about how
much water use there's been?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are sort of the overriding
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Basie four things we'll look at
sort of four different parts of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is more anecdotal, but is there
less water than we think in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll do a little case study on Fall
Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second one is how much do we actually know
about agricultural water demand in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Third is what sources of water could
agriculture make use of?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very different than the West where
they have snow packs, they have large
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been planning for irrigation Basie
since the beginning of settling that West.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fourth one is can we actually
demonstrate a benefit of irrigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a place to start is just thinking
about sort of a case study of what do we
[SPEAKER_00]: know about water use in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna look at Fall Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason, it's nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason, it's a good size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watershed at least above the gauge is
about 125 square miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big enough to actually have some water
to do something with, but small enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a grasp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our map, so we're right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, we literally are right here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The gauge, so one nice thing about this
watershed is it's actually gauged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most gauges in New York are either on New
York City water supply watersheds or big
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a relatively small
watershed that's gauged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has some interesting things
going on in terms of water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Cornell water filtration
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did most people know Cornell has their own
water filtration plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's several places where they
pull water out for irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: all related to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Varna, they have some irrigation
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the Homer Thompson
vegetable farm out in Freeville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that's
interesting too is there's a discharge of
[SPEAKER_00]: water from Dryden Freeville wastewater
treatment plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually inflow to this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, that water,
we could consider it an out-of-basin
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer in the sense that it's basically
groundwater from homeowner wells or from
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be in the basin, but it's
basically deep groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not surface water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can basically say, can we do
some water accounting for what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: available?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, it's really only been the
last few years that anyone's really
[SPEAKER_00]: bothered to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't pay too much attention to
what's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Basie Cornell, as far as I know,
has really only made an attempt to compile
[SPEAKER_00]: the records for the last four years,
so going back to about 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, though, we've had some really dry
years in there, so 2011 and 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basie approached the historical lows in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the historical lows determined by going
back, the USGS gauge goes back to 1925.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Basie picking off the monthly minimum
all the way back to 1925.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2011 and 2012 come pretty close to
those monthly minimums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get a good sense of demand when
you're actually at your minimum in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some of the demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell Ag Withdrawal is Basie for
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see sort of what we might expect,
but often this data isn't available,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that when it's drier in 2011 and 2012,
you use more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you use about four times more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing to look at here, and we'll kind
of put this all together in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is in MGD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone know what MGD is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in million gallons per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in water supply, that's a pretty
typical measure, is to use million gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's around 0.1 million gallons per
day in terms of maximum irrigation demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is monthly average.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Cornell filtration plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use between 1 and 1.5 and 2 million
gallons per day of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've been doing this, we've been
learning some interesting things about who
[SPEAKER_00]: uses water and how they use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the golf course actually uses filtered
water from the water filtration plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas most other places, well,
irrigation on campus just uses unfiltered
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were sort of surprised to find
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so putting these numbers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one thing to realize is the
withdrawals and the gains to the system
[SPEAKER_00]: are all upstream of the gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gauge is basically not telling you
what's available before you take anything
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically telling you what's
available after you take things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a relatively good indication of
the lowest available flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we basically look at filtration
plant subtracting off, Cornell irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: subtracting water, and then Dryad and
Freeville adding some water and comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: that to 1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 1964 minimum, assuming the
gains and losses are the same as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not quite sure if they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be September 1964, including
these current gains and losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like if we look at historical
minimums, drought of record, we would
[SPEAKER_00]: always have some amount of flow in Fall
Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 2.7 million gallons per day isn't much
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone know probably what it's
flowing at right now, Fall Creek?
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to put a number out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do this in my classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to ask people, make some guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about, I didn't look at the
gauge, it's probably around somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: around 100 mgd right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the summer when you go out there
and you think it's pretty dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably around 20 mgd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say 2 mgd, we still have water,
that's not a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically a trickle of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So main point is, if we look at this,
we do still have some water, but not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can basically say within the
historical record, drawing some water out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the system, we're basically getting to
a point where if you take much more water
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the system, you have nothing left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people haven't really, as far as we've
talked to Chris Bordelme, who runs the
[SPEAKER_00]: wastewater treatment plant, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a number for what their maximum
withdrawal can be, but it's actually based
[SPEAKER_00]: on their plant capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not based on hydrology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one is really out there looking to
say, are there minimums that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing too, is that these are all
based on monthly averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know within a month there's going to
be variability, but then within a day
[SPEAKER_00]: there's variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go and look at the USGS gauge
record, and this is instantaneous flow,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's every 15 minutes, you see this
cycling like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually been trying to figure
this out for a while, what this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's only shows up in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've realized is Cornell changed
the way they operate their plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: so now they turn it off at night for a few
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this does is, if your daily
demand is 2Mgd, but you turn it off for
[SPEAKER_00]: half the time, that means your demand when
it's on is 4Mgd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the irrigation works the same way,
if they only turn it on certain times of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, turn it off certain times of the
day, your monthly mean, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting what you have available,
but you could certainly be at a point
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day where you actually dry
things out, where your instantaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: demands exceed what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems pretty reasonable,
just based on this case study,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there definitely can be places,
one of them being Fall Creek, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, where if people aren't really
looking at how we're withdrawing water,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could potentially run out of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to note to this, and as we go on
a little farther, is the way this operates
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's what we would call
run-of-the-river system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out west, or places like that,
ideally what you have, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: run-of-the-river.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a reservoir, some storage to draw
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, we're basically just taking
whatever water's in the system is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're taking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we talk about other potential sources
in New York State for irrigation and water
[SPEAKER_00]: demand, what we want to look for is places
where it's not run-of-the-river,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you actually have storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about New York, though,
we don't necessarily have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Great Lakes, we have the
Finger Lakes, but they're not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: at an ideal point to make use of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see a little later on where we
might actually have a source that people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't always think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two of this is to ask the question,
besides just this case study, what else do
[SPEAKER_00]: we know about irrigation in New York
State?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any numbers out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically two entities that make
an attempt to put some numbers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's USDA, so they have their
agricultural census every five years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they ask some questions about
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically ask about irrigated
acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's USGS, US Geological
Survey, that also every five years comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out with estimates of water use on a
county basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these numbers, official government
publications, they're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it might be reasonable to
trust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it might be a little small,
but you can probably kind of see it from
[SPEAKER_00]: the back, depending how young you are or
old you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first three columns, USDA, National Ag
Statistical Survey, National Service Data,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's irrigated acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last column is USGS demand in
terms of MGD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing kind of apples and oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is actual demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just some interesting things to pick out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Genesee County, and I'll show a map in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll actually go do it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't know your New York State
geography and you're wondering where these
[SPEAKER_00]: places are, so places with most
irrigation, Basie from Nass, Orleans,
[SPEAKER_00]: Genesee, and Wyoming counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are sort of the three highest ones
stacked up right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Wayne County and Niagara County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably sources or what they're
irrigating is a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wayne and Niagara County, probably
predominantly orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well known, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where most of the apple production
is in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Orleans, Genesee, and Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orleans and Genesee, probably more
vegetable production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wyoming, I actually don't quite know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's mostly crops, but that's sort
of part of the gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so then our other source is thinking
about USGS demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: How consistent is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about the USGS
demand is it doesn't exactly correlate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest one for USGS demand does
correspond to Genesee County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have other counties with
relatively low acreage that still have
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively high USGS demand numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go do just some back of the envelope
calculations, so I basically just took
[SPEAKER_00]: NGD, converted to cubic meters per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a little easier to think about,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of look at a few possible
irrigation rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Basie centimeters per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at how many acres irrigated would
one NGD give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can kind of do a comparison
between acres and NGD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So irrigation rate, it seems like 10
centimeters per year is probably the high
[SPEAKER_00]: end in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be hard to believe you have a
year that's much drier and you need more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 10 centimeters per year during
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would say 10 centimeter per year
irrigation rate, you could irrigate almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,500 acres with one NGD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would, in Genesee County,
if the numbers are right from USGS,
[SPEAKER_00]: 5 NGD at 10 centimeters per year would
give you 17,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: What NASA's reporting is 6,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like a pretty big inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's even going to be true,
especially when you look at some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller counties with less acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Erie County, 3.36 NGD, 390 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pretty big inconsistency there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly something's missing that we
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: USGS does this for every county in the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the report,
there's about five people in the report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however they do this, it's some way
where they really crank through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this Basie raises more questions than
it answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basie says, it doesn't tell you anything
about how often is irrigation occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we trust the NAS data, which I think is
pretty reliable, it basically just tells
[SPEAKER_00]: us it's irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tells us nothing about actual demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell us how much water is being
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't tell us where the water is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this inconsistency
pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've sort of alluded to,
there's more data becoming available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Basie is coming from the Great Lakes
Compact, which was discussed and agreed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be passed back in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a Basie agreement between states and
provinces in Canada about how to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: their water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And New York State, as part of that set,
they would actually start to try to track
[SPEAKER_00]: water usage, non-potable water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011, people who used over 100,000
gallons per day of non-potable water use
[SPEAKER_00]: had to Basie start telling the state that
they're using the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Basie voluntary in the sense that the
state doesn't know if you don't report.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does is it starts to give us a
data source.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what this is is this is,
for the most part, people reporting to DEC
[SPEAKER_00]: who's collecting that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is we geo-referenced at least the
address associated with the user,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it might not literally be where it's
taken from, but we're doing the best we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is overlaid over a crop map
of different types of crops in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yellow is corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker green is soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pink is alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see the darker red is
usually, in some cases, it's apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it's dry beans and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it starts to give you a pretty good
sense of some distribution of things in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we have added in here is,
and I'll start to talk about this in a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, is the Barge Canal Authority also
provides water to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take water from the Barge
Canal, you have to get a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have the blue dots are people
with a Barge Canal permit to draw water.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you put this out there,
this is sort of our best picture to date
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of site-specific users of
irrigation water in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it basically matches up with what we
knew from the NAS data in terms of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are centered in Orleans County,
Genesee County, and there's actually a few
[SPEAKER_00]: more off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go this way, which get cut off there
down in Wyoming County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, the dots lie in
areas with agriculture, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like it's consistent with what
we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, no, we still don't
really have any idea of demand,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water they're using or where
they're taking water from.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we do kind of know is,
with the DEC data at least, it does give
[SPEAKER_00]: information about who the user is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there is a little bit of
withdrawal data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what DEC data there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some sense of demand,
and then we have some sense of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, as I guess we might
expect, it's fruit and apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, so horticultural products that
would generally be more sensitive to water
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some examples up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so one thing you might notice,
and I sort of highlight here, is we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: large concentration along the Barge Canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody from New York State?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have most people walked along the Barge
Canal, just to get a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: A few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, a lot of people haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So original Erie Canal, 1825, Basie went
from just outside of Albany over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, upstate New York was mostly
forest land, and it effectively opened up
[SPEAKER_00]: the Western frontier at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about every city in New York State,
in upstate New York, is Basie on a river
[SPEAKER_00]: or on the Erie Canal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the Erie Canal?
[SPEAKER_00]: In about 1905 or so, the Erie Canal was 80
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to update it, so they built
the Barge Canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places, it stayed along the same
path, but in other places, like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city of Rochester, it went around the
outside of the city of Rochester.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you basically have this almost
200-year-old major engineering feat
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, so I'll talk more
about it in a minute, I think they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: budget of over $100 million a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think their revenue is about $100,000
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ever wonder why your taxes are
so high, or especially why it costs so
[SPEAKER_00]: much to drive on the thruway, you can
partially think the Erie Canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where the Erie Canal goes on
that western side of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Basie totally flat, and it drains out
of Lake Erie, and then here's Orleans
[SPEAKER_00]: County that it cuts across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it eventually hits the Genesee
River over by Rochester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Basie, the reason all that irrigation
is there is because they're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of the Barge Canal, of pulling
water to the Barge Canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two things, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the original Erie Canal was actually
intentionally built up higher to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they built the Barge Canal,
they built it lower, so it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: intersects the Genesee River now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a good thing, because it
basically means, what this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's basically a direct conduit from Lake
Erie across the state, and it also can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially pull water from the Genesee
River.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start to talk about,
is there actually infrastructure in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State where we can draw upon stored
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Barge Canal is it, because it's Basie
connected to the Genesee River and Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think most people really look
at it that way, but that's really what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this project is Basie thinking
about, are there ways to sort of optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of that infrastructure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a nice view of things, 1905.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably looks more quaint then than it
does now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it looks that bad now
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Medina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Engineering Port from 1905.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is interesting, so Basie,
when they modified the Barge Canal from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Erie Canal, they intentionally
recognized, so when you open the locks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the canal, you basically lose water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a lot of water coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they realized was, so they
intentionally made sure they had a large
[SPEAKER_00]: source of water, and here is the Lake
Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they Basie put a number on this,
so they say that it has a capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide at least 1,237 cubic feet per
second of water in this portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of MGD, that's about equivalent
to about 1,000 MGD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a potential to carry,
to convey a lot of, to supply a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question you might ask is,
okay, so if it's not the Barge Canal,
[SPEAKER_00]: are there other sources of water in the
state?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some aquifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those correspond to glacial
valley bottom aquifers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, they're not extensively
tapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might go there, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just something else to put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so despite the fact we know there's
irrigation in the Northeast and in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, I think the other question that's
out there is, scientifically, is it
[SPEAKER_00]: defensible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it necessary?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know people are doing it, so it seems
like it must have some value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there other evidence out there of
what the value actually is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say, surprisingly, there's
really not that much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of farmers that say,
I think we need to do this, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, if you start to look
for actual scientific studies that show
[SPEAKER_00]: the need for it, there's really not many
out there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that complicates things,
I think, as most agronomy people know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially in the Northeast,
is you have lots of different factors
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top here, I just picked corn just
because it was a nice image, I could find
[SPEAKER_00]: it easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the top, I have different factors
that can affect yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, in the Northeast, early season
wetness is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How soon can we actually get in the field
and plant things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once things actually start growing,
is it actually warm enough for the crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we accumulate enough growing degree
days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once things are growing, do we have rain
we don't want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we flood our field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are things too wet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, once things are actually
getting mature, and there's actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of water demand, do we still have
enough water?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really the fourth one is the
one we're really asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we're trying to control
with irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difficulty in trying to understand
how much of our yield is dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture availability is also trying to
identify these other controls on your
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically have a bunch of factors,
a lot of them not related to moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: availability, or at least a moisture
availability deficit, that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate to see how important that other
factor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just showing peak demand for
corn about 60 to 80 days in, so by July,
[SPEAKER_00]: August.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we'd be most interested in
having water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some interesting studies from people in
Canada, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess a group, Cowan and all,
they're looking at horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at temperature,
and they're looking at mean seasonal
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, and then they're looking at
just days over 30, so just sort of short
[SPEAKER_00]: sporadic changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they saw for a few things, cabbage,
cauliflower, some significance just in
[SPEAKER_00]: days over 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they actually saw some
significance with days with rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: not with growing season precipitation,
but they see short periods without enough
[SPEAKER_00]: rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of evidence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other sources of evidence out there that
irrigation might actually matter and sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of potentially be useful in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop insurance data, which is out
there, as we can see, so this was for
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue one, this is indemnities for crop
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly for apples, freezing is a much
bigger deal than excess moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, excess moisture doesn't
even show up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know they irrigate apples,
but it appears, and that might be the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason it doesn't show up, is because it's
already irrigated, so people don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: include it in terms of crop loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn, irrigation does show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most years, at least lately,
we've had too much water, but 2012 is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did show up as people claiming crop
insurance for lack of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then we've also been doing some
of our own analysis using NAS data,
[SPEAKER_00]: so National Agricultural Service data,
using county-level data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've just been doing is just
starting with relatively simple things,
[SPEAKER_00]: so just trying to predict annual yields
and using growing degree days,
[SPEAKER_00]: using June precipitation and July
precipitation, basically for sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and then using May precipitation
for being too wet early in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is for Livingston County.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is down near kind of Danville,
kind of Danville in kind of the center of
[SPEAKER_00]: the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, not a great model,
but the main thing I kind of look at is do
[SPEAKER_00]: we get the quadrants right in terms of
observed versus predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing to note is that here,
importantly, if you just try to model just
[SPEAKER_00]: using GDD and early season wetness alone,
it's not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only when you put in precipitation,
kind of summer, July, June precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, some more evidence suggesting
that yes, precipitation or moisture during
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things get complicated though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another county.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Genesee County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this one, we actually find the
model, the best model is actually just
[SPEAKER_00]: includes GDD and just includes May early
season moisture, not summertime
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not quite sure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where they're in the process of
kind of deciphering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you move around county to county,
why do things change?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, there is a little bit of
irrigation in the county, 2%, but probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough to make a difference in terms
of changing these relationships here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possibility is soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might have deeper soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you have less rain,
you have more moisture availability over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't quite know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're basically trying to kind of
decipher these relationships and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get a better sense of what's going on to
make the case that irrigation is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is only for corn,
for vegetable crops, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so kind of the final part of this is
when we consider this, and part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: project was sort of considering
historically what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also part of this is basically
looking at potential for climate
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation with the assumption that things
likely and will change in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we haven't done our own
work, but looking at what other people
[SPEAKER_00]: have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a paper by McDonald and Gervitz
about two years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, for the entire United States,
looked at moisture deficit using climate
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they basically, on changes in
moisture deficit, they used historical
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships to irrigation, given
moisture deficit, and projected how things
[SPEAKER_00]: might change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for New York State, they said there
might be an increase of up to 25,000
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares in irrigated land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they recognized something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a well-known study, Anderson and
All, from about five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a climate assessment in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also used climate models,
looking at changes this is in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, summer soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw a decline in summer soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it's a climate model,
so you can't put that much, if any,
[SPEAKER_00]: trust in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like they did see a decline
of about one centimeter, so not a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems reasonable to think that in
the future, there'll be some additional
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be equally important to not
only looking historically, has there been
[SPEAKER_00]: a need for irrigation, but basically
changing sort of the equation of can you
[SPEAKER_00]: justify it more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can kind of tell, the project is
basically ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing this for about six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically are going to do it for
another year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we can make a few conclusions
already, and then think about where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing is basically given the
reliance on run-of-the-river supplies in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State, for the most part,
it does seem like there is potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict between users.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do know, like say for Fall Creek,
we belong to a CSA, which is Ithaca
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently started farming right next
to the Homer Thompson vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a plan to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of small users out there
who might be using water that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily fall under the 100,000 gallon
per day threshold to report.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for now, those people kind of remain
invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's enough of them,
they might matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, the remaining inconsistencies
in what we do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of NAS and USGS, there's
basically no consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little consistency between that
data that's being put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clearly, gaps are reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite not really being intentional,
the barge canal seems to be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting piece of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently being used to some degree,
evident by the number of people clustered
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's interesting questions
to ask of, is there a capacity to put more
[SPEAKER_00]: people around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I don't really get into,
because I don't have the information yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there's an expense with irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to irrigate, you basically have to
say, is the economical benefit from what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get in increased revenue,
does it equate what you have to put in in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: The barge canal is potentially
interesting, because everything's nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a pretty cheap source of
irrigation in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a pretty economical way to
irrigate nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on some analysis of what data is out
there, dry periods do cause measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: declines in yield, despite other factors
that cause measurable declines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely, we can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of better eking out,
what is that as a total percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: loss, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of the economic part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, as I said at the end,
climate change will probably make things
[SPEAKER_00]: more economically feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems pretty likely things are going to
become drier in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remaining parts of our project are
basically to do an intensive survey in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a survey of farmers to
basically get more focused information in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of what sources of water they're
using, how much are they using,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what kind of irrigation equipment are
they using, and also what are they
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to also continue on with doing
more crop yield modeling to get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, I think it should be sort
of an interesting picture of sort of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: to a degree, sort of untouched
consideration of non-potable water use in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going out in the future, it might be
some potential for future investment in
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation in New York, if you can kind of
make the case that there's a place to
[SPEAKER_00]: boost production without basically having
too many competing users for the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all in there, and I'm happy to take
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
