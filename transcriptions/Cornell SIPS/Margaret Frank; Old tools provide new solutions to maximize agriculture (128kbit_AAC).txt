[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to be presenting back in
this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I gave a seminar here was my
job talk many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very exciting to be back giving
my tenure seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I jump into the science,
I've learned to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, before I jump into the science,
I really have to thank my amazing lab
[SPEAKER_00]: members, both past and present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are just an incredibly strong and
active group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flipped back through my photo reels all
the way to 2018 when we started and
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that we moved lab spaces three
different times so far, hopefully one more
[SPEAKER_00]: time when the renovations finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was almost no complaining during
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an incredibly adaptive group that
continued to science through the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first grad student graduated kind of in
the midst of the pandemic and was just
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly productive in that challenging
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as we enter another challenging
time, I'm just really proud of this group
[SPEAKER_00]: for always looking for ways to push the
science forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my lab's work focuses on plant
grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although as you heard, we had some soybean
money, so we've done some other stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just focus on the grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grafting is simply the physical
joining of separate plant parts so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they share an interconnected vascular
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout this talk, I'll really
emphasize that last, that second part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the definition, the interconnected
vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really crucial to our understanding
of what makes grafting work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grafting is pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our way of making real live
Frankenstein's monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens incredibly easily in the
plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grafting actually occurs in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two examples of kissing trees
that we saw in Yosemite on a hike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a self-diffusing tree by the
Ithaca Farmers Market that you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historians think that it was human
observations of these natural grafts that
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired the first agricultural
applications of grafting, which date back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the literature to 424 BCE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was likely co-invented in ancient
Greece and in Asia at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say old tools for maximizing
agriculture, to some extent, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: prehistoric tools and really anciently
historic tools in human hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many applications of
grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to point out a few
prominent ones that we might care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grafting is used across viticulture to
protect vines from biotic stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very famous decimation of use of
European vineyards from the phylloxera
[SPEAKER_00]: outbreak in which the vineyards were saved
through grafting to Missouri rootstocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild Missouri rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you enjoy wine, you might
appreciate the benefits of grafting in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grafting is also used to modify plant
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of dwarfing
rootstocks that make apple harvests more
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also used in pear harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the reverse direction, in vegetable
crop production, grafting can be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: invigorate the shoot system, or scion,
and greatly improve yields in tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: key pervets predominantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a direct topic of my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grafting is also used in horticultural
art.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of 40 different
varieties grafted onto one stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably one of the most recent
innovations in grafting is that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest ketchup and fries from the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually buy this in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's covered on a Stephen Choldair
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grafting has wide horticultural uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our case, most of us probably read
about grafting when we're studying most
[SPEAKER_00]: mobile signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's also used to demonstrate the
movement and signaling function of
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides, small RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: An emerging field is messenger RNAs that
we're doing a lot of work in, and
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so grafting is really the gold
standard for demonstrating mobile
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this area of grafting was really the
extent of my knowledge when I entered into
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of grafting of a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I learned about its dominance
in agricultural production, I really
[SPEAKER_00]: became fascinated with the concept that we
could actually use modern molecular tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand some of the molecular
biology that underlies beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural grafting and potentially
start to engineer beneficial grafts for
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural systems, which I think we're
really at the cusp of doing just now,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost seven years into having the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do most of our work in tomato and
the broader nightshade family because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy to graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't show you this video just so I have
enough time to get through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced by Cornell alum,
Dr. Molly Edwards, who is also in Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: Scanlon's lab when I was a PhD student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has a whole series of science IRL
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very easy to graft tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has almost 100% success.
[SPEAKER_00]: In grafting, and it heals quite quickly
relative to woody crop systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the shoot system or scion
and the root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the joining graft system,
the graft junction that's formed 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: post grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a very popular technique
that we use in the lab with confocal
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging of cleared tissue where we can
actually image into that graft junction
[SPEAKER_00]: and study the vascular connectivity that
occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the two parts of the plant heal
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here we're getting into the
vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the regenerative
processes that are occurring give this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stitched together xylem and
phloem system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can look at how that is
disrupted and the genes that are involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in placing that vasculature so the plant
can reconnect partially using this
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomical imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason to study grafting in
tomatoes is that they are widely grafted
[SPEAKER_00]: for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many people in the room knew that
the tomatoes that you buy at Wegmans or
[SPEAKER_00]: your favorite grocery store are grafted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I've been here a few years,
but still not everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much all tomatoes produced
through controlled indoor agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems are grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two root stocks that both invigorate the
production of the scion as well as provide
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic and biotic stress protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a trip that I took the very
first summer of starting my lab to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands where I visited a plant
propagation facility where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ready to graft 100,000 plants to
ship to the Middle East for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's used around the world in
agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully some of the stuff that we
learned can influence some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: practices in positive ways in tomato
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite the fact that grafting has been
used internationally for millennia,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are still some core questions that
motivate the exciting biology that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one really exciting and challenging
question is how different graft
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations produce emergent phenotypes,
especially phenotypes that are beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another question is just what
moves across the graft junction and to
[SPEAKER_00]: what extent are mobile molecules
functioning as signals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really focusing on mobile
messenger RNAs here, which I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to talk about, but I will point you
to some great resources from my lab during
[SPEAKER_00]: the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, at the most basic level,
we don't have a good understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: determines whether or not two species are
going to be compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compatible with each other, whether or not
they can form interconnected vasculature
[SPEAKER_00]: during grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by compatible, I mean the ability for
two things to coexist without problems or
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ability for them to stitch
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we study our questions in this
compatibility framework where two things
[SPEAKER_00]: can graft, but maybe they have like no
appreciable beneficial impact on each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
two things that are incompatible have a
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic coexistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're unable to coexist in that graft
format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the beneficial side,
ultra compatibility is where two things
[SPEAKER_00]: can graft and that graft produces
beneficial outputs that we appreciate as
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not evolutionarily beneficial,
but appreciated by us through our lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the work that we do we've
done is on this spectrum of compatibility
[SPEAKER_00]: and incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my first student to join the lab,
Dr. Hannah Thomas, was super excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she really carved out a lot of work in
this direction that two police boys,
[SPEAKER_00]: a PhD candidate and Sam Yander,
a PhD student, are now carrying forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so graft incompatibility is not a huge
problem for tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomato grafts pretty well to its wild
relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be a big problem in woody
crops, and it can go undetected for long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really a classic graft
incompatibility between pear and quince.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can see this, the product divide
across the junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by detecting that incompatibility,
growers can then graft in an interstock
[SPEAKER_00]: that is mutually compatible with the
rootstock and the scion, which is super
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually rescue these
incompatibilities if you can detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that the information that we
learn from tomato is going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: useful markers for detecting
incompatibility in these other systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the process of grafting is very
similar across different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you graft two things together,
there's an initial adhesion that occurs
[SPEAKER_00]: through the release of pectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps stick the cells together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a wound response process promotes
the formation of callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like an undifferentiated
wound responsive tissue that then starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to make contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the callus will start to form
plasma-dismodal connections and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate across the graft that callus
fills in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that space, vascular
differentiation and other tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation starts to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequent, the presumption of
physiological transport and subsequent
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation leads to a very,
very strong junction that is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger than any other part in the stem,
because you now have extra vasculature,
[SPEAKER_00]: extra lubrication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this whole process involves local
signaling to actually place the vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: strands in the right place to reconnect
the two plant parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process is not understood at the
molecular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of vascular patterning and
differentiation genes and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes affect the integrity and
biophysical strength of the plant at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see how that informs some of
the tests we use to look at compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand compatibility in our
system, we grafted tomato to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different nightshade relatives that were
readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looked at whether or not there
were negative impacts on the plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a really pronounced negative
impact on pepper-tomato combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is self-grafted tomato,
and this is temeper and pep-mato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this picture really
accentuates the impact of the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tomato on a cayenne rootstock,
grafted at the same time as self-grafted
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so often these plants are
physiologically impaired, which leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a pretty clear incompatibility
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, the plants do live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it'd be hard to study them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we consider this system an example
of delayed incompatibility, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unable to graft, but they're able to
survive for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually had a temeper plant live
in my office for over a year, so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: live and grow very, very slowly for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of Hannah's work looked at
what causes this incompatibility in
[SPEAKER_00]: pep-mato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I dive into it, I'll just show
you some of the detailed information we
[SPEAKER_00]: have about what happens when tomato is
self-grafted, so when we have a compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: graft forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was collected in collaboration
with nuclear physicists at WashU Med
[SPEAKER_00]: School, Dr. Yuanxuan Tai, who just had a
unique passion for plants and built his
[SPEAKER_00]: PET imager, which allows the tracking of
radio-labeled nucleides through 3D space
[SPEAKER_00]: and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He built it inside of a growth tamper,
so you could do physiologically relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used that to track a labeled
carbon CO2 movement in grafted plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: were sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an airtight seal right above the
junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see is that at five days
post-grafting, we start seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: resumption of carbon transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that indicates that physiological
transport through the phloem happens as
[SPEAKER_00]: early as five days post-grafting in this
setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used labeled nitrogen to track
biolum transport, because labeled water
[SPEAKER_00]: has a very short half-life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that the plants resumed
transport as early as six days
[SPEAKER_00]: post-grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within less than a week,
you have a healed junction that's
[SPEAKER_00]: transporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In PEP-MEDO, we didn't have access to the
PET imager, although I'm pretty excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about the new exleap proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the synchrotron will have similar
capacities in a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a fluorescent dye called CFDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's phloem mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the aphids are contaminated
our plants, are taking it up in their
[SPEAKER_00]: bellies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of good contamination,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at the FDA, it gets
stopped at the junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we looked closer into the anatomy
of these grafted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is in self-grafted
plants, you have these nice long spaghetti
[SPEAKER_00]: strings of xylem running through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in PEP-MEDO, we have this
disorganized vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's forming these anastomoses and
failing to connect and communicate across
[SPEAKER_00]: the junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a very similar phenomenon in the
reciprocal direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now with forming O-staining for
lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get this mass of differentiating
vasculature that's failing to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: and coordinate with the other half of the
graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we consider these bridges to nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have a bridge to nowhere
here in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people know the plans for the
bridge to nowhere in Ithaca?
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting connected to a major trail
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will become a bridge to somewhere
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of our hope with this
work, too, is that one day we can rescue
[SPEAKER_00]: these incompatibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, the plant is forming
bridges, but they're not connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not reconnecting the physiological
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has major consequences for the
biophysical stability of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a bend test that Hannah
invented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you bend the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it breaks at the junction,
it fails the test, because that junction
[SPEAKER_00]: is supposed to be the strongest point in
the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it breaks anywhere else,
it passes the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so tomeca and PEP-MEDO almost always
break at the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, you get an
exception, because it's biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost always break at the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing we looked at was whether
we could identify some genetic regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: that are controlling this compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we collected RNA-seq data of
PEP-MEDO and tomefer grafts and tomato and
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper self-grafts at 1, 3, and 5 days
post-grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked with Dr. Ross Ozzani's lab
at NC State to build, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: our above average pretty gene networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look organized to me, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to identify putative
major regulators of graft formation at the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1, 3, and 5-day time points, as well as
mixed time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for self-grafted tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The networks for incompatible grafts were
crazy and really hard to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this huge mess of
dysregulation, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did was we mapped on the
loss of connectivity in the network to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for genes that were important in
compatible graft formation that are
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupted in the incompatible grafts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example of one gene
that we see that has altered connectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's TTI5 that Dr. Greg Martin's lab
happened to have mutants for, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: interacts with AVRPTO, one of his favorite
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was implicated to function in
grafting at 1 day post-grafting,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when those cells should be
adhering to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see that the vasculature
connects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graft actually forms OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a fissure that remains at the
wound site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have more work to do to understand
what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of a neat example of the
networks informing some of the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that surprised us was that
most of the hubs in the cell graft
[SPEAKER_00]: networks and in these incompatible grafts
are not related to vascular patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our big, most apparent phenotype in
these incompatible grafts is disorganized
[SPEAKER_00]: vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that that's because a
minority of the cells in the harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue are actually forming new
vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bulk RNA-seq data set with a lot
of different things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're less pronounced in the
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pulled out known vascular patterning
genes based on a network from Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really nicely characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we built our own network from these
genes based on what's differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed across our time points and graft
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this network, there's a lot of
hypotheses to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one was the role of this transcription
factor called LOX4.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's involved in cambial specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one indication that it might be
important in this process is that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat chaotic expression in Ptomekker
and PEP-MEDO relative to self-grafted
[SPEAKER_00]: where it has this gradual elevation in
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also able to obtain mutants
for this from Zach Lipman's lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in 2020 when it was challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to do lots of wet lab work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see these LOX4 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're relatively normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit centered in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, they look like a normal
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make vascular bundles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a nice stem anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we graft them, they have high
survival rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is self-grafted wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is self-grafted LOX4.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Hannah performed the Ben test and
saw that 100% of them actually break at
[SPEAKER_00]: the junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an indication that there's a
loss of biophysical stability even though
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's maybe our big PR message
from the lab is that survival doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: equal compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually look at the anatomy of
these LOX4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all such a wild type that form
vascular connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that they are impaired in
specifying vascular connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Elise is looking more into the extent
to which this occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool that these networks
helped us find one regulator in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of vascular specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we go back to the vascular network
from Arabidopsis, you can see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: other potential genes that are likely
involved in placing the vasculature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place so that reconnections happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LOX4 is the one that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But upstream of LOX4 are these small
signaling peptides called TDIFs or CLEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CLE41 is one of those genes that help
specify a LOX4 in the process of vascular
[SPEAKER_00]: patterning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are also able to get a mutant
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like it's disrupted again in
the vascular specification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, Elise is looking into the
extent to which this occurs and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: this really alluring signal could be
playing a major role in placing
[SPEAKER_00]: vasculature in the right place so that
roots and shoots can communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one question that we've asked
ourselves after collecting all this data
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking at these mutants is whether
we've really explained graft
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does LOX4 look like our PEPMEDO
intranet for mutants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in PEPMEDO, we have disorganized
vascular proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in LOX4, we just fail to specify the
vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these networks are telling us about
genes that are essential in graft in but
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not explaining the phenomenon of
incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hannah dug deeper into the role of
tissue death in incompatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this was in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dark times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she just looked at basically the
persistence of dead tissue at the graft
[SPEAKER_00]: over a long period of time using this
tricam blue staining where this deep
[SPEAKER_00]: purple color means that the cells are
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these lighter purple colors are kind
of just noise in the imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she looked at 7, 14, and 21 days
after grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found, she quantified it
using an image tape pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found is that there are
similar levels of dead tissue one week
[SPEAKER_00]: after grafting in self-grafted plants and
incompatible grafts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, the self-grafts will clear
that dead tissue and the incompatible
[SPEAKER_00]: grafts persist in having dead tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, you want to see what was
happening in terms of gene expression in
[SPEAKER_00]: this persistent tissue death process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she did RNOT at these time points as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, she pulled apart the cyan
half of the graft and the stock half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this top half is cyan data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bottom half is stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just looked at differential
expression and saw that the
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility in incompatible grafts,
this is aligned to the tomato genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the pepper genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of factors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incompatible grafts have a dramatic
upregulation and downregulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of go categories that
are enriched across these time points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some that point us towards
some really cool models for what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, which is just a nice reality
check, is that there's a response to water
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not making xylem connections,
so that felt right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still unclear how plants live for
this long without making xylem
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the open physiological mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition, there's a lot of these
gene ontology categories related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant immune system and defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Hannah's big hypothesis from this
data, and she did a lot more digging that
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into, but her big hypothesis is
that the incompatible combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes are causing this activation of the
plant immune system that's leading to cell
[SPEAKER_00]: death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to hear more about our
approach to digging into the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: details and mechanisms that might be
working within this hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Sam Leander's seminar next month,
the student seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another question that we looked at is
whether PEP-MEDO and TEMEPR are a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: type of incompatibility, or whether there
are some general rules that guide
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility in this branch of the
solenoid seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Hannah did was she did these
reciprocal graphs across a few members of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solenoid that were possible to grow
and graph together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ignored Nicosiana and vintage Baco,
because there's some pretty wild reports
[SPEAKER_00]: of Nicosiana being able to graft across
pretty much any flowering plant family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a super grafter that's doing
something exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we stuck to this branch of the
solenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't look like a ton of plants
to graft together, but once you start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the reciprocal graphs in
replication, it's actually a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, all the graphs survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So survivorship is not a measure of
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-graphs form really nice vascular
connections that string through the
[SPEAKER_00]: junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intra-generic graphs within solanums,
this is tomato and eggplant, form
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful vascular connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work done by Michelle Heaney,
a PhD candidate in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, this system is so strong that
it's formed a system that she's using to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at long-distance communication
between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all inter-generic, so across genera,
graphs fail to communicate and form these
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really ugly disorganized graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a ton of confocal imaging to
look at this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also performed the bend test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a pretty good indicator of
compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much all the incompatible graphs
here break almost 100% of the time with
[SPEAKER_00]: the bend test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really don't have to do imaging if
you want a fast measure of this property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to wrap up this part of the talk,
we have found many ways to make graphs
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also collected some really great tools
to study this in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really expanded the tool system
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, TomPlant and EggMado is another
system for studying communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Michelle has just awarded the best
three-minute thesis in Cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can watch her talk on YouTube or
hear her talk in a real seminar for a much
[SPEAKER_00]: more in-depth view of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're hoping to use these tools to
eventually find ways to reconnect those
[SPEAKER_00]: bridges, so make graphs succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I think, will be a tremendous
effort to overcome incompatibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to use the last part of the talk
to talk about this other end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, where we're looking at
compatibility, this neutral coexistence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really TomPlant and EggMado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have huge beneficial
impacts on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultra compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is an area of work that's
really kind of brand new results coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at the ability to
program communication within plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra compatibility from the viewpoint of
the farmer or the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the goal here is to actually
reprogram the way plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating, to give us more information
about the environmental context in which
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are growing, and enhance the timing
and quantitative responsive management
[SPEAKER_00]: practices from our end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first kind of example of this
reprogramming that we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: involves the signaling system called the
SEP signaling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, terminally encoded peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say the name says it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a root-to-shoot and
shoot-to-root signaling system that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to forage in heterogeneous nitrogen
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's partially responsible for kind of
the classic high nitrogen, low nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: split plate response that's described in
the literature, where roots will branch
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow more extensively in areas of high
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how this works is that under low
nitrogen, roots will start to express
[SPEAKER_00]: these small peptides called SEPs that move
from root to shoot, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: perceived by a receptor called SEPR1,
which turns on the production of a
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream signal called SEP downstream,
really great naming scheme here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which moves back down from the shoot to
the root and influences nitrogen foraging
[SPEAKER_00]: responses, including upregulation of
nitrogen uptake transport orders,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as increased root branching in
places where there's high nitrogen and not
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our idea was that we could actually
plug into the signaling system to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about when plants are experiencing below
ground nitrogen stress by seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: output of this below ground signal in the
shoot, and then actually reprogram the
[SPEAKER_00]: activation of the signaling system to turn
on in response to other below ground
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a huge collaborative
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the major postdocs and grad
students who have been leading this work
[SPEAKER_00]: across my lab, Sijun Lee's lab,
Abe Stuk's lab, and Mark Bilesine's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've created
these reporter plants that tell us when
[SPEAKER_00]: SEP downstream is turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when SEPs have moved and turned
on the response by turning on a ruby
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pigmentation reporter in
tomato plants under low nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it really nicely expressed in
the flanking phloem region, where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: then going to produce a downstream signal
that moves back from shoot to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also made fluorescent lines in
Arabidopsis to look at a more quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: response of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the exciting kind of new
data coming out of the lab where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so up here is wild type tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up here are these ruby lines under 13
days of nitrogen deprivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a grad student in Abe's lab,
Jacob Belding, has actually quantified
[SPEAKER_00]: using a really simple image processing
pipeline that he developed the response of
[SPEAKER_00]: these ruby lines under low nitrogen over
time versus wild type plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing here is that you
actually start seeing a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: response within days of low nitrogen
treatment, which is way before any grower
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to see that with the yellowing of
leaves and the lost productivity of their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we have this early alarm
system to help people manage their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that can then be adapted to many different
below ground inputs that are hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've also built this in
Arabidopsis with fluorescent reporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you see the kinetics are quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within six hours of low nitrogen
treatment, we see this reporter turning
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought this is quite a rapid
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the big question is, when does it
actually turn off?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you apply nitrogen, can you turn the
signal back off and use it throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: season?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll be getting into these messier
questions in real field environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have plants that are actually
started already.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Tucson, Arizona, they're going to go
out to Maricopa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another set of plants that are
going to be here in Aurora, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing amongst cornfields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really cool to see work from
our lab going out into the real world to
[SPEAKER_00]: be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the quote unquote real world,
the research environment, but still the
[SPEAKER_00]: field to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, the next step is really to
see to what extent can this communication
[SPEAKER_00]: be reprogrammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell us about other below ground events
that are really hard to monitor throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think I have four minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you about, I'll end with
actually the first grafting phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: that got me into grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the phenomenon of grafting
induced vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where when you graft to a hybrid
rootstock, an inner specific hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: rootstock, you get this boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vegetative and reproductive output that
increases yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the commercial rootstocks are
typically formed through these crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: between domesticated tomato and a green
fruited tomato called Solanum Hebrides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most popular commercial
rootstocks that we use in our research as
[SPEAKER_00]: well is MaxSupport, Max for short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you graft to MaxSupport,
the domesticated tomato shoots system has
[SPEAKER_00]: this huge boost in its growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's just the increase in biomass
that you get when you graft to MaxSupport
[SPEAKER_00]: that then influences an increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a large reason for why the
grafting is used in tomato production,
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to abiotic and biopstress
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a really cool thing with this
phenomenon is that it's highly repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: across environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a greenhouse, growth chamber,
and multiple field studies showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the MaxSupport rootstock really increases
vegetative biomass and yield across
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, which is not common in
biology to find something that repeats
[SPEAKER_00]: across environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions that I actually
started out asking is whether it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid state of the root system that's
increasing the biomass of the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is I compared yield in a
domesticated tomato grafted to a Hebrides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rootstock versus a hybrid, an F1 hybrid
that I made with this Hebrides crossed to
[SPEAKER_00]: M82.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I compared that to the influence of
MaxSupport rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I saw is that it's really the
hybrid state that boosts yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also my random hybrid that I made just
because the seeds were available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab performs pretty similarly to one of
the top performing commercial line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because, I think, we were
growing these in field conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of rootstock breeding is
targeted to controlled agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the very first grant in the lab
that we got was a hatch grant to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we can identify other rootstocks
that are beneficial for outdoor New York
[SPEAKER_00]: state growing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made 30 different hybrid
rootstocks with different Hebrides
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotypes and grew these in high tunnels in
Breville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very popular way to grow
tomatoes near here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much any farmers market tomato
that's available earlier in the season or
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the season is likely harvested
from one of these high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that many of our experimental
rootstocks, marking green, perform equally
[SPEAKER_00]: well to some top commercial rootstocks,
or sometimes even a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is another example of us going
really out into the real world,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we were able to take our top
performing rootstocks, test them out at a
[SPEAKER_00]: major production site, two hours from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Zade Herdick welcomed us and our crazy
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't get a quantitative measure
of whether or not they liked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, they're significantly taller and
healthier than the non-grafted plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Tian is working on a more
quantitative measure of what influences
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not people use grafting in
their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's performing a real intensive
survey at these grower expos, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: been really fun to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like how the Hebrides probably
has untapped potential for positively
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing production and the ability for
plants to perform, Nora is looking at how
[SPEAKER_00]: other wild tomatoes are also influencing
the performance of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's making a ton of other hybrid
process to these different, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different, not all of these, but some of
these different wild species that have
[SPEAKER_00]: superior stress capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see whether you can rapidly adapt
tomato to challenging environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think, a really cool
direction of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to wrap up, we have a ton of awesome
tools for the spectrum of compatibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: incompatibility and ultra compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, more questions than we
started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to thank the lab again for
carving out these questions and leading
[SPEAKER_00]: the work forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our collaborators and people who really
generously provided resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't typically do this, but because
it's a tenure seminar, my mentors,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially Adrian Roeder, the head of my
mentorship committee, who has made tons
[SPEAKER_00]: and tons of time for me during the last
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then funding, without which none of
this would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully funding continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a relationship between whether
you can recover hybrid, F1 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_04]: easily and graft compatibility?
[SPEAKER_04]: An LEI and Haberkine's era and that tail
end where you don't need to do certain
[SPEAKER_04]: embryo rescue and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is reproductive compatibility an
indicator for graft compatibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a really cool study where a
group in Germany actually overcame
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive barriers between two
Nicosiana species through grafting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to fuse the genomes of
the nuclei basically into one new
[SPEAKER_00]: allopolypoid individual that could set
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the graft compatibility is much,
much broader than reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what that showed us at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How was Max originally selected given that
hybrid heredity seems to be almost as
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like other heredities?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a suite of other
traits that are probably highly relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: to control agricultural environments,
including probably stacking of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, in addition to its ability to
promote that grafting induced bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is one of the most invigorating
rootstocks that we've evaluated and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely like a sure fire way to
increase vegetative and reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass, which can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people have to like,
it takes a lot more maintenance to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants in check.
[SPEAKER_05]: The question was the incompatibility that
the involvement of the immune response.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I will hear more from Max.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just thinking that isn't a two
immune response suppression of the immune
[SPEAKER_05]: response?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a continuous process or is it
happening at the very beginning?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it overcome that it's mainly the
developmental process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's such a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's right on Sam's mind is
like which part's active in allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to graft and whether it's like an
active process to be able to graft or an
[SPEAKER_00]: active rejection of incompatible graft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll know in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really know anything about
plant grafting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fungi, there can be some
intraspecific fusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like there are lots of strains of the
same species that don't talk to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has really helped in finding
these like immune response mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering if there are like in
plants, if like there are different
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates of like tomato that maybe are in
the same species or separate species,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like don't talk to each other at all,
or don't pass the bend test or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could maybe use to help get at
some of that immune response questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were thinking about maybe integration
lines where you have the chunks of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really distant species that could help
with mapping the genetics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But tomato grafts pretty well to like the
wild relatives that we've tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but there are examples in
Cucurbitaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cucurbit, so there's, yeah,
more distinct incompatibilities within a
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should look at and try to get
adventurous.
[SPEAKER_03]: How adaptable do you think the nitrogen
reporter plant could be to like remote
[SPEAKER_03]: sensing via UAVs?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's a drone that will like
fly over the Maricopa fields and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Aurora fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am like a detailed phenotyper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little skeptical, but the field
people aren't so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any parallels to this to like
parasitic plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: A useful tool to explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's help us kind of hone in on
some of the next set of candidates that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be interesting in those networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's these LBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of these lateral boundary
domain genes, but there are ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: essential for host parasite interactions
in tomatoes that are also expressed in our
[SPEAKER_00]: data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like high level candidates.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
