[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Neid, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone, for coming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Angela, and I'm going to be sharing
some research plans and some preliminary
[SPEAKER_00]: results for my PhD work here, which is
focusing on nanoscale characterization of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-mineral interfaces, particularly in
intact soil microaggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start on the very broad scale,
these are just some values of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks in various parts of the global
carbon budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil, as we know, is a fairly large
stock of carbon, especially compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly stated to be about three
times the content of carbon in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really relatively large stock is
important for the overall carbon budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether carbon in soil is increased or
decreased or stays consistent is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor for overall carbon
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a global soil organic
carbon distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here on, I'll be focusing on
organic carbon, showing in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: permafrost really high carbon
concentrations in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also like to focus on some more hot
spots of high carbon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'd like to talk mostly
about volcanic soils in areas like
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesia, Mexico, and particularly
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, zooming into the island of Hawaii,
the carbon content in volcanic soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are part of the Andesal soil order,
have a relatively high carbon content
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to a lot of the other soil
orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, based on radiocarbon data,
a lot of the carbon is very old,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that it's fairly stable in soil
and has been there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this actually depends a bit on the age
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine a brand new lava
deposit, just being a few hundred years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, ranging to soils that have been
weathering for four million years,
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the middle, there's a peak in
the amount of carbon content and also
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a concept that has been linked
particularly with mineral properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: that medium age soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly apparent in
deeper horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map of organic carbon content
at a depth of about 60 to 100 centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a red showing higher contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relative to, for instance,
the contiguous to the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that deep soil horizons in
Hawaii and other volcanic soils have much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher carbon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is linked with
particularly mineral properties in this
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really good example of the
overall relationship between carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilization and minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is apparent in many different
ecosystems with varying degrees of
[SPEAKER_00]: importance dependent on that mineralogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a process that I like to think
about as ranging from the ecosystem scale
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way down to the scale of a few
microns, a few nanometers at the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: interface of carbon and minerals in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in the example of the volcanic
soils, you have an ecosystem property,
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these medium age soils,
they are dominated by what we call short
[SPEAKER_00]: range ordered, or semi-crystalline,
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll refer to those kind of as both SRO
or semi-crystalline minerals for the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving down to the nanoscale,
there are properties at the actual surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of these minerals, such as pH dependent
charge and high surface area that are
[SPEAKER_00]: related to their carbon storage
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to give a brief overview
of some of the proposed mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon stabilization by minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an important concept is that the
actual mechanism involved is very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: to the mineral, the type of carbon
present, and also the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that are at work in that
particular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just one example is a mechanism of
ligand exchange or anion exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilization of soil organic carbon by
the semi-crystalline or short range
[SPEAKER_00]: ordered minerals that I mentioned earlier
in volcanic soils, allophane and amogolite
[SPEAKER_00]: being two examples of that kind of
mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to ligand exchange and anion
exchange, just a few other general
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction mechanisms, hydrophobic
interactions, hydrogen bonding,
[SPEAKER_00]: cation bridging, general effects of
entropy, and then a little bit less direct
[SPEAKER_00]: than actual surface stabilization,
you can also have more indirect effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: physical protection by mineral facilitated
aggregate formation or stabilization in
[SPEAKER_00]: pores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all just very general
proposed mechanisms of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilization by minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more interesting models of
surface interactions is the zonal model
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed by Kleber, where you have
amphiphilic molecules, which basically
[SPEAKER_00]: have a polar end and a non-polar end,
creating this kind of bilayer model where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the polar end interacting with
the surface, and then the long sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: non-polar tails interacting in a
hydrophobic zone, and then lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential interactions with the aqueous
solution on the kinetic zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many different proposed
mechanisms, but why does that really make
[SPEAKER_00]: a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we know it's stabilized,
why do we need to know how?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's really important
because the actual mechanism involved may
[SPEAKER_00]: respond differently to changing
environmental variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increased temperature, increased moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, an example would be a
covalent or an actual chemical bond,
[SPEAKER_00]: an inner sphere complex formation,
for instance, may respond differently to
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer temperatures than, say,
a weak hydrophobic association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing what kind of mechanism is
involved could be really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction of future soil carbon
stabilization and modeling, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, all of these mechanisms that
I've mentioned have mostly been determined
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly by adsorption isotherm
experiments, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, they lack direct
observation and characterization in real
[SPEAKER_00]: soils or in situ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do have so far for analysis of
carbon-mineral interfaces in soil has
[SPEAKER_00]: shown, unsurprisingly, a very
heterogeneous distribution of carbon on
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale of an aggregate and all the way
down to the scale of an actual mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: particle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this image shows carbon in yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is nanosecondary ion mass
spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the carbon is really
distributed in discrete patches and not
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed evenly over the surface of the
mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this patchy distribution has also been
observed all the way down to a single
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this presents a pretty substantial
methodological challenge for observation
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of both the spatial heterogeneity
and also chemical variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get a little bit more into the
methodological challenges, namely spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution is a huge limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some current techniques, such as NEXAS,
which is Near-Edge X-Ray Adsorption Fine
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure, which is a synchrotron-based
technique, has about a 25 to 50 nanometer
[SPEAKER_00]: spatial resolution, which is just too big,
unbelievably, seems so small, to encompass
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of variability that we see in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, some other methodological challenges
are the use of a stabilizing material to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make thin sections, which is
often carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it's really hard to see carbon
when you use a carbon-stabilizing resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for instance, in this study,
mineral particles were kind of shaken up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then distributed on a surface,
so you don't maintain the spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution in an actual aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, in general, high-energy
analysis using an electron beam or X-rays
[SPEAKER_00]: can create sample damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all things that have to be
considered for direct observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one method, this is now what I will be
focusing on for the rest of the talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a combination of scanning transmission
electron microscopy, or STEM, and electron
[SPEAKER_00]: energy loss spectroscopy, lots of
acronyms, EELS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just really briefly, EELS involves the
electron beam from the microscope going
[SPEAKER_00]: into a very thin cross-section sample and
then some of those electrons will just
[SPEAKER_00]: pass right through and some of them will
interact with the material and then
[SPEAKER_00]: scatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the scattering is
inelastic, which means that it loses
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can measure that energy loss
with a spectrometer, hence getting
[SPEAKER_00]: electron energy loss spectroscopy,
and that's just basically how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get an energy loss
spectrum, you have some distinctive peaks
[SPEAKER_00]: for certain elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is carbon, which is in diamond and
graphite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have a distinctive peak
position and shape, or the fine structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: which tells you something about what that
carbon is bonded to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's bonded to oxygen, it's a double
bond to another carbon, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an idea of what functional
groups are there and what their
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of STEM EELS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an image of an Amazonian dark
earth that has biochar particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this particular image shows an
aluminosilicate clay in red and then iron
[SPEAKER_00]: oxide on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can determine, using EELS,
that it's oxidized iron, or iron 3,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the intensity signals,
which I'll be talking about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So EELS is a really good tool for both
very high resolution, ideally for a
[SPEAKER_00]: homogeneous material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolution can be up to 0.2
nanometers, about 2 angstroms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is unbelievably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: For natural soils, probably not that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also be able to get information
about the chemical composition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really useful combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'd like to give an overview of the
main chapters or sections of my PhD
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, I'm going to be compiling a
library of sorts of EELS spectra for a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different soil minerals,
and then also common model carbon in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then building on that, collect EELS
data for simplified mixtures of carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be designed based on
specific hypothesized interactions that
[SPEAKER_00]: have interesting spatial information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, a simplified system where
the environmental variables can be
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So redox potential, or pH, that somehow
may be affecting the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of the end goal,
or the epitome of all of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is applying the technique to real soils in
thin sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: While, importantly, maintaining spatial
distribution in the sample, eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of stabilizing materials,
or carbon resins that would allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: not be able to analyze carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also minimizing sample damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of pursuing each of these
three things all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you a few aspects of each of
them, and then the next steps for each as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, some of the standards that
I've chosen are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they represent a range of elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I specifically am also analyzing volcanic
soil materials, allophan and imogolite,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, as well as some other
elements, calcium and phosphorus minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then similarly for carbon,
there are many different kinds of carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: present in soil, as we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've selected a list that cover a
broad range of functional group types,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also some that are specific to black
carbon, or biochar, because I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Johannesburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to show you a couple of
reference spectra that I've collected so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are for hematite and gertite,
both iron minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hematite is an iron oxide, and gertite an
iron oxyhydroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these particles is ground very
fine, and then deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lacy background is carbon that you
just deposit the materials on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with some areas on the
edges that are thin enough for eels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole particle is going to be way
too thick, but you can get some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: regions on the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I start showing a bunch of spectra
that are not going to mean a whole lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to give a quick overview of
some of the terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about nexas or
eels, you're talking about K, L,
[SPEAKER_00]: M, and N edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these basically correspond to the
simplified Bohr model of an atom,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy levels, that you can also see
in your gen chem electron configuration
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your core electrons closer to
the nucleus that are your K and L edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will require more energy to be
excited or to move to the next energy
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then out in the outer edges,
you have the M and N, which are more of
[SPEAKER_00]: your valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those require much lower energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a simplified schematic of an
eel spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right at zero, you have a huge peak
called a zero loss peak, which tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: how many electrons just pass straight
through your sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to know that because you want
to know that it's thin enough to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to use this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really important thing to
collect for all of your spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have this kind of indistinct
bump in the low loss region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's indicating all of those M
and N edges in your valence electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of overlap between
different elements in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard to get really
qualitative information from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can kind of confirm that,
OK, well, I see the iron M edge,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that means iron is definitely present
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to move out into the
higher energy regions where you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at your carbon, iron, oxygen
edges, the elements of interest,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you start to get an apparent
peak for the core loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of this fine structure that
tells you something about the binding
[SPEAKER_00]: environment of that element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a spectrum for hematite and
grotite for iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the iron L edge now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on initial kind of observation,
they look fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, even very small shifts can be
meaningful in terms of discerning between
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is a little bit of a
difference in the shape of this little
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder, there could be a shoulder here
that could vary by different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this very subtle shift in peak
position may be meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, there isn't a whole lot of
information in the literature about these
[SPEAKER_00]: fine distinctions between iron minerals
and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could add some really good
information to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hematite has been imaged before with
eels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a spectrum in the literature,
so it's quite similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, which has been pretty well
established, is that the ratio of L3 and
[SPEAKER_00]: L2, these two peaks, is a function of the
sample oxidized to reduced iron content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we can use eels to kind of
discern iron 3 and iron 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a pretty consistent
relationship between the ratio of those
[SPEAKER_00]: peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have hematite, which is
theoretically 100% oxidized iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then something like phthalate,
which is theoretically 0% oxidized iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to kind of map in this
spectrum a wide variety of different redox
[SPEAKER_00]: states in iron, which is really a useful
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: For oxygen, you can see that the spectrum
starts to look a lot messier, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: takes away a lot of the conclusions you
can draw from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a pretty apparent difference
between the ratio of A and B in this
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that that is related to
the degree of oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also a very consistent,
predictable trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use that to determine the iron
oxygen ratio, which is another really
[SPEAKER_00]: useful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, for hematite and gertite,
this is the valence region, the really low
[SPEAKER_00]: loss, starting just above 0 up to about
60.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there isn't a whole lot of really
great information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have carbon coming from the grid that
we prepared the samples on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do have an iron M edge here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really good for as an
independent confirmation that iron is
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might be able to get some
information from that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, two other minerals that
we've analyzed so far are gibbsite and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxyapatite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at aluminum, calcium,
and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum is really hard to get EOSpectrum
for because it is in the low loss range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, there's a lot of
overlap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a challenge, which is a little
unfortunate because aluminum, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very common in soil and a very
important part of mineral interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just quickly, this is a list of the
remaining minerals that I have to analyze.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, some volcanic minerals,
allophan and imogolite, some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: normal crystalline clays, and then also
iron oxides that represent that range of
[SPEAKER_00]: iron oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have started working on some carbon
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: An issue with that is they are much less
resistant to damage from the electron beam
[SPEAKER_00]: than iron minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, typically, when you have any
sample that goes into the microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to clean it with a plasma,
an oxygen plasma, before it goes in so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it doesn't contaminate with just
things floating around in the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, these are carbon compounds
and cleaning them up with plasma would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just burn them away, which would
be kind of useless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have a good way to clean them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this ends up posing a huge problem
with carbon contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get around that,
we're working on doing eels at very low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature called cryo-eels, which helps
eliminate carbon contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also using alternative sample
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example is critical point drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, I'm just going to give a quick
overview of my proposed work in these
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something that I've started
yet, so I'd be glad to hear any input you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have in this or suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, these are going to be
simplified systems in a kind of a classic
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorption isotherm type approach based on
some specific hypothesized interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: and then followed by analysis of the
particles themselves with eels to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can kind of really unequivocally
determine what is going on at that
[SPEAKER_00]: interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one example of one of my
proposed combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be using a polar carbon,
shown here just generically as RCOOH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a non-polar carbon with a generic
carbon chain, and a mogulite, another,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, one of the volcanic minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one hypothesis is that the polar carbon
will be involved in covalent bonding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but only at the edges or the ends of the
mogulite tube or at broken sites on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, and that the non-polar carbon may
not interact at all, or it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in some kind of secondary
association with the polar carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you an idea of the spatial
distribution that we might see,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could see just polar carbon at the
ends and non-polar carbon not associated
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see it everywhere or just in
broken sites and non-polar not associated
[SPEAKER_00]: or non-polar could go to the ends or it
could cover the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of different
possibilities here, but what is great
[SPEAKER_00]: about this technique is that we'll be able
to see, you know, a difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: this carbon and this carbon and be able to
assign where it is spatially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which is really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next, one of the proposed
incubations or adsorption experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: would involve a sequence of reducing
conditions and oxidizing conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing oxidizing, reducing oxidizing,
to try to encourage iron co-precipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: with carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been some recent work about
spatial differences between carbon that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just adsorbed to the surface of oxidized
iron versus carbon that's just physically
[SPEAKER_00]: intercalated in the structure of a
co-precipitate between iron and carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just something that has a
really interesting spatial characteristic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really the benefit of the
technique that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to select things that
have some kind of interesting spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, I'm going to show you some
preliminary results from actual analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: of real soils, which is kind of the
ultimate goal of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, the main
challenges here are preventing damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sample, eliminating that carbon resin,
maintaining the spatial distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: within an aggregate, and then also being
able to analyze both carbon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so similarly to the cryo-eels I
mentioned for analyzing the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, we're going to be using
cryo-fib, or focused ion beam milling,
[SPEAKER_00]: to prepare the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this will account for a few
of the methodological considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then followed by that, we'll be using
cryo-eels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is frozen from beginning to
end in water, which is a more natural
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix than carbon resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might have guessed,
my initial soil samples will be from
[SPEAKER_00]: volcanic soils, from a model ecosystem
with mineral control on carbon turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soils that I'm using right now are
collected from Hawaii by collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie Grant, who's here, and Lou Derry,
and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular sample is characterized as
a Waimea silt loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about in the middle range of soil
age, around 350,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's characterized by those
short-range ordered or semi-crystalline
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some scanning electron
microscope images, just of intact
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates, just to give you an idea what
they look like and how variable they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that you have some that are
kind of lumpy and some that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth, some that are stretched out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in the aggregate shape,
there's a lot of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were collected from deeper soils and
also from a system that has relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: high iron and carbon content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are well-drained, so they're
probably dominated by oxidized iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected aggregates in the range of
about 53 to 150 micron diameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so microaggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for ease of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a better size to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, these microaggregates may have
really stable mineral interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a little cartoon of how we
start to section the aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, they're hydrated slowly with a
humidifier, and then just dropped in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bead of water, flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and then cut into
[SPEAKER_00]: sections using a cryo-ultra-microtome or a
diamond blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little boop, and then it ends up on
a copper grid in a thin section that still
[SPEAKER_00]: has ice around it, and it stays frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, if you can visualize it,
this is now that grid looking from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of these little blobs are sections
of carbon, so you can see they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to look at them from the
side, they are actually relatively flat on
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides, amazingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they kind of cover a range of shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them kind of break apart on
natural breaking points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them look like pork chops,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them look like tacos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have to find the one that
just looks just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one you go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after you have your perfect
sections that you want to try to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you then, in the fib, which is the focused
ion beam, you have a beam of gallium ions
[SPEAKER_00]: that come down at an angle and kind of cut
out a wedge out of the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with a really thin area at
the bottom, and then just sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal sample thickness at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in each of these
images here, we have our wedges with only
[SPEAKER_00]: the very edge of the sample probably thin
enough for eels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's getting down to a really small
area for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of have to get a little
bit lucky that you catch a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting feature in that tiny area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we fortunately did last week,
and hopefully more to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just some very preliminary
results for some of our initial images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one of those sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a tiny area of one of these
sections then blown up much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this tiny area blown up bigger
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, an elemental map of that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an electron dispersive x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very coarse scale map.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that we have carbon,
which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this area here is
relatively homogeneous carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not mixed up with a lot of other
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a particle of mostly
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No silicon, so it's probably an aluminum
oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is a little bit of a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have gallium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where could that have come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the gallium ion beam,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So gallium likes to deposit itself on the
sample sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just something we need to be
aware of and make sure that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: changing our signals too substantially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice, though, that it's really
concentrated in the aluminum area and
[SPEAKER_00]: hardly any signal at all in the carbon,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we can be able to analyze the
carbon without worrying about gallium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something we need to consider
for future analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now going even smaller, we have this
area of carbon and aluminum blown up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: stem image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your carbon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each of the areas of different
contrast are higher atomic weight
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they show up differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even more magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then have carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can start to see this interface
with a mineral that we have putatively
[SPEAKER_00]: determined as aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even one more image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the highest resolution I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this kind of fuzzy but still kind
of distinct interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to note here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This scale bar is 50 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I mentioned NEX-S at the
resolution is 25 to 50 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: just imagine that half of this or the
whole thing is just one whole pixel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a much better spatial
resolution already, even at just this
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, than we could get with NEX-S,
which is a really exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also exciting, we collected a carbon
K-edge yield spectrum from this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my knowledge the first in real soil
without a carbon resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of an exciting day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a particularly distinctive
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a few things that even just
with very preliminary analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can start to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no peak at 285, which is
characteristic of aromatic carbon and very
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent across all types of carbon for
NEX-S, which is mostly related to EELS
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have these two kind of indistinct
pre-peaks at about 287 and 289 EV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could really be a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be shift of aromatic carbon with an
oxygen or nitrogen, or could be aliphatic
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: 289 could be carboxylic acids or amines or
alcohols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the value of determining
the carbon reference library and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: real soils, because we can really start to
link these peaks and their characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: with the known functional groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a line scan, which basically
takes points along a line that you draw on
[SPEAKER_00]: the image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start to kind of get a range
across a gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, in the adjacent carbon region,
this is the spectrum I just showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then starting to get closer to the
edge, you can see that the spectrum starts
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a lot messier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of variability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it starts to get
thicker as you get closer to the mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we continue to prepare more samples,
we really want to try to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: thinness of the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to continue to be
something to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can already see that there are
some differences, potentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the relationship of those first two
pre-peaks just at this outer edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at a point closer to the
interface, there are quite a few new small
[SPEAKER_00]: peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to take a lot of analysis to
get what might be meaningful out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the less
signal-to-noise ratio we can get,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better it will be at being able to
pull out features of these spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, one more on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the first pre-peak is
almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meaning of this is going to take a
lot of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of an exciting development
to see that there are differences across
[SPEAKER_00]: this mineral carbon region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next things that I'm going to be
working on, continued sample preparation
[SPEAKER_00]: for the thin sections, continued analysis,
and then working on linking carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: compound chemistry and the interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just in general, continuing to
analyze standards, the simplified mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments, and then lots and lots and
lots of data analysis forever and ever to
[SPEAKER_00]: get meaningful information from this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to acknowledge my
funding, which is from the Cross-Scale
[SPEAKER_00]: Biogeochemistry and Climate I-Grip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've been working with the
Cornell Center for Materials Research,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a really, really essential piece
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would definitely not be able to do it
without our collaborators in physics,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Muller, who works with EELS,
and Lena Fitting-Kirkutis, who does FIB,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then their grad students have
collected a lot of this data with me and
[SPEAKER_00]: have been really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my thesis committee, my advisors,
Johannes Lehmann, who's not here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, we've gotten lots of
support from my lab and the support staff
[SPEAKER_00]: at the CCMR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are tons and tons of really
interesting resources, which obviously you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you ever want to talk about where I
got any of this information from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be glad to discuss it further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, thank you so much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
