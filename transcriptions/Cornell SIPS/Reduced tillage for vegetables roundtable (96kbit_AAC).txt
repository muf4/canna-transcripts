[SPEAKER_08]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Carol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they try to pull the wound up
bigger than it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she just did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always looking at innovative ways to
try and improve crop production and soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my earlier years, soil health was not a
big concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover crops, that was nothing we really
paid attention to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as time went on, looking at what I
thought was the demise or lessening of
[SPEAKER_03]: crop production in the area, that's when I
started focusing on cover crops and soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health and reduced tillage was a key part
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everything we've done seems to have a
positive impact on our bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our yields every year seem to be getting
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inputs seem to be going down somewhat,
if you want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nutrient management is an important part
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Focusing on banding all the nutrients we
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chemical dependency, yes, we're still
dependent on chemicals, but with our
[SPEAKER_03]: reduced tillage methods and cover crops,
we've finally been able to reduce some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the herbicide application rates instead of
being on the maximum end of scales,
[SPEAKER_03]: be it the medium or lower end of scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've said enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I'm going to introduce Wally's.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I butcher anybody's names, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's not even here if you don't want
to hug him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they're taping this and
recording it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wally Zakowski and Mike Zagnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike's a field manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started using zone tillage about
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: They farm about 180 acres, including vine
crops, tobaccos, cabbage, and broccoli.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've used zone tillage on pumpkins and
winter squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been very pleased with the results
thus far, especially the spaghetti squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Planted on a heavy rye residue.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've shared their equipment with three
neighbors and have also heard positive
[SPEAKER_03]: results.
[SPEAKER_03]: While it doesn't look like yields are
different, which I wouldn't expect,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they didn't experience a yield drag,
apparently, there's much less wind erosion
[SPEAKER_03]: and better drought tolerance in fields
that were zone tilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this, in a turn of the light,
is going to explain the operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: My name's Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Plainville Farm in Hadley,
Mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're down in the Connecticut River
Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an extreme problem with soil
compaction down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we got into zone till was we
grow one of our main crops is butternut
[SPEAKER_04]: squash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one year where we ended up not
being able to sell a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also peel it, but we were not able to
sell a lot of it due to a lot of ground
[SPEAKER_04]: stain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started looking around, and the zone
tillage actually seemed like it would be a
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty good idea to get into for us for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first year, we ended up finding a
used machine due to the price of a new
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We made it suit our needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of our compaction was probably from
15 to 19 inches down, so we set the
[SPEAKER_04]: machine for about 22 inches so we wouldn't
have a problem with anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed to do all right the first year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried it on a few acres, about five
acres of butternut, and a couple acres of
[SPEAKER_04]: the spaghetti squash.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real difference we saw was more in the
spaghetti squash, actually, than in the
[SPEAKER_04]: butternut.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spaghetti squash seemed to not have
anywhere near the ground scarring and was
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot cleaner than we had expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cover crops weren't that great the
first year, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to not previously planning on buying a
machine, we had to work with what we had
[SPEAKER_04]: from the year before, which was the cover
crops weren't as thick as they should have
[SPEAKER_04]: been.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was a good trial experience anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second year that we used it,
we increased our acreage a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to about four acres of spaghetti,
I think it was about 10 acres of
[SPEAKER_04]: butternut, and we also tried a few acres
of sugar pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_04]: The butternut, once again, we didn't
really see any yield differences,
[SPEAKER_04]: but time-wise, instead of spending a day
and a half longer to prep the field before
[SPEAKER_04]: we could plant it, if I started about 15
minutes before Wally was doing most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: planting, I could stay well ahead of him
with the machine, which is just better
[SPEAKER_04]: ground moisture, less time, less fuel,
less aggravation, which at that time of
[SPEAKER_04]: year is a good thing to have less of.
[SPEAKER_04]: For side dressing, we didn't have a
machine set up for side dressing,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we ended up taking one of our williston
cultivators, a two-row williston,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we took all the rollers off of it,
bought an old potato fertilizer hopper
[SPEAKER_04]: with the transmission, mounted it on top
of it, and we had two double disc openers
[SPEAKER_04]: that we put on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We moved the disc openers about two inches
to each side of the plants, and we were
[SPEAKER_04]: only a couple inches in the ground,
and it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was enough to cover the dry fertilizer
and not disturb the soil too much,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that the cover crop was still there no
matter what was supposed to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, the quality was a big factor
with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The third year,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was 2009, that was an extremely wet
year, and this machine, it really showed
[SPEAKER_04]: what it could do in that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had fields that were planted with
butternut that were next to another field
[SPEAKER_04]: of butternut, and our field had hardly any
water standing in it compared to the one
[SPEAKER_04]: that was next to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same bibs, same nolls, a lot of rolling
ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: The disease pressure seemed to be a little
bit less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot, but enough to make a difference
where we actually sprayed one time less
[SPEAKER_04]: than the fellow next to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other big factor was when we went
through and sprayed the fields,
[SPEAKER_04]: we weren't sinking in up to a foot and a
half of the sprayer like the other fellow
[SPEAKER_04]: that went through the fields were,
which makes a difference in the end too.
[SPEAKER_04]: The product that year was, it was our
rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody had a real good year that year,
however we were.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality, we store a lot of the
butternut.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality seemed to hold up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the best, but like I say,
it was a tough year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year, the only thing I can say is
every year that we've been using the
[SPEAKER_04]: machine, we're finding the more that we
use it, the more we like it, the more
[SPEAKER_04]: things we're trying it on, the more luck
we're having with it, and to be honest
[SPEAKER_04]: with you, we really haven't found anything
we don't like about using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an easy machine to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's adjustable to a wide variety of
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing that we noticed last year
this past season, with it being as dry as
[SPEAKER_04]: it was, was wind erosion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out where we are, there's a lot of guys
that grow sweet corn and a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: conventional tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were planting our squash,
a lot of the sweet corn fields were
[SPEAKER_04]: tilled, and there was a couple days there
where it looked like a sandstorm out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You couldn't even see the plant,
but when you drove by the zone till field,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was hardly any sand blowing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants didn't get wind-whipped,
not from our field.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did get a little wind-whipped from
the other guys on the other sides,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, but it was interesting to see
the way it worked that year as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did notice a difference, too,
in the butternut that was on zone till
[SPEAKER_04]: versus a conventional, that the plants
were healthier.
[SPEAKER_04]: They seemed to, for whatever reason,
needed to get down to the water more,
[SPEAKER_04]: or I don't know what their reasoning
behind it was, but it seemed to work out
[SPEAKER_04]: very well for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fruit quality was excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: The yields were where they should have
been.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were up a little bit on our land that
we had the zone till on versus the
[SPEAKER_04]: conventional fields, only because the
plants seemed to survive a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing that we're gonna try this
upcoming year, using the zone till,
[SPEAKER_04]: the one thing that I can't stress enough
is that as much as you use the zone till,
[SPEAKER_04]: the roll cleaners on the front of your
plant are just as important as the zone
[SPEAKER_04]: till is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going through heavy rye,
we actually, on the spaghetti squash we
[SPEAKER_04]: have, because it's planted a little bit
later, the rye is usually taller and then
[SPEAKER_04]: it mats down, and the zone till,
the two discs in the basket will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: ride over that matted rye to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is when the planter goes
through the first couple years,
[SPEAKER_04]: we didn't have the roll cleaners on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up having to stock it over.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to a couple of meeting sessions
during the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, it was brought to our
attention that the roll cleaners are
[SPEAKER_04]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up putting them on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we've done that, we haven't had to
stock over or restock a field.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a blessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future, coming down the road,
what we hope to do this year, we're
[SPEAKER_04]: actually gonna end up putting roll
cleaners on the zone till machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only because of the thickness of the rye,
we don't really see where it's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: affect anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every little bit helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're shooting, like one of the machines
that Honor showed, had a fertilizer hopper
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna start playing with banding,
banding some dry fertilizers, only because
[SPEAKER_04]: every year the price of fertilizer keeps
going through the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, you know, guys that are
growing corn with the potash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Potash this year, I guess, is gonna be
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any little bit of money we can save down
the road is money in our pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we hope to really do is do a one pass
tillage with mounting a couple of vacuum
[SPEAKER_04]: units behind the row units.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one pass down the field will
literally take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're striving for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably two, three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down the road, a little bit every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hopefully where we aim to be in a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I say, the more we've used it,
the more we love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody that talks to me, I can't say
anything bad about the machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to encourage everybody to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any questions for him quick?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just spray it and go right through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually, the cover crop, we usually
spray beginning April.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not organic, so as early as we can
spray it, we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for the spaghetti squash because
it's planted a little bit later,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we let the rinds get a little bit
bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to experiment also.
[SPEAKER_04]: This year we have a lot of Sedan grass in,
so it'll be interesting to see how that
[SPEAKER_04]: machine will do with Sedan grass after
being laid down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not incorporating any harvest
leftovers, so do you see any increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: overwintering insects?
[SPEAKER_04]: The one thing, we chisel plow all our land
after we go through and harvest the crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're aiming to do is try and get
away from the arrow, which is non-vertical
[SPEAKER_04]: tillage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any vertical tillage seems to work better
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've done in the past is just sow
the rye and run over it with a disc
[SPEAKER_04]: chisel, and it seems to work beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a little bit longer for the rye
to come up, but it does come up decent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: How deep do you go?
[SPEAKER_04]: With the chisel plow?
[SPEAKER_04]: About 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple, while he was talking,
a couple things he mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wind erosion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up our way on these nice winter days,
sometimes you can drive up down the roads,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can tell where conventional
tillage is done and where reduced tillage
[SPEAKER_03]: is done just by the color of the snow
banks on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's talking about banding more nutrients
upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been test results, proven results
at banding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banding nutrients get you a much higher
efficiency rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thus, banding nutrients with a higher
efficiency rate, you can use less rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one pass operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to put planting units on the
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I'm from, I'm 100 miles west of
here, 20 miles to the side of Rochester,
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some growers off our way growing
corn, silage corn, grain corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That do have planters attached right
behind their zone builders and are doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: one pass operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern is we have a lot of rock that
way, and I'm afraid that planter pays a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good toll sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zone builder has a tendency to pull some
of those particles up, but they seem to be
[SPEAKER_03]: making it work all right, and it's pretty
efficient for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One pass, one person, one tractor,
one pass, and the crops in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have Joseph Brightley.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to give us his overview of what
he's been doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe lives in Hamlin, grew up working on
his father's farm, Dean P. Brightley
[SPEAKER_03]: Farms, growing processing vegetables,
cabbage, and winter squash.
[SPEAKER_03]: He graduated from Cornell in 2009 and
enthusiastically tried zone tillage in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: His father has been kind of stepping on
his head a little bit, holding him down a
[SPEAKER_03]: little.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's pretty enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe's called me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've conversed a few times at meetings,
on the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a real big interest in this
reduced tillage and trying to improve the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far he's done a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe, turn it over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Don said, my day gives me enough rope
to hang myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as I get close to dying, he pulls me
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Joe Brightley from Hamlin,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 25 miles west of Rochester,
five miles north of Brownport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We strip till about 1,500 acres of mixed
grains and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a Case IH 1240 planter for just
about all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 12-row brilliant zone commander,
and we have RTK GPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GPS is essential in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the operator see where he's
going, even if he can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows him to look back at the planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more going on, whether it be
moving debris, as you said, rocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it really does help
the operator from looking back like this
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time and trying to focus on where
you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes your life a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our planter, we have a floating row
planters, which do whip away the debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how I say whip away the debris.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be making trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be just slightly moving the
debris away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows the gauge wheels to move
smoothly across the ground, which helps
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform seed depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uniform seed depth is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have them come up within hours
upon each other, which will drive yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have dramatic down pressure,
which helps dramatically in different
[SPEAKER_00]: field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zone till actually the seed bed is a
little more mellower than if you go across
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground with a field cultivator and a
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go from one section of the field to
the other on a large field, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust the down pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way I've found to adjust down
pressure is you get the planter down,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back there, you grab the gauge wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't turn it at all, you've got to
lessen the down pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can spin it freely, you need to
increase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just turn it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a fertilizer coulter on front to
band fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a single disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of debris, look at
non-fluidic coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the coulter discs will hairpin
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really have a problem with that,
look at straight coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back of this coulter, we have an
injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have used the knife, the shank that
goes right behind the coulter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We press it right up against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's compressed right up
against it, we've still had issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: corn stalks and other debris getting
wedged up in there, creating the coulter
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop turning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real pain, especially at 730 mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the row cleaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: See these donuts right here?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are essential for these sharp teeth
floating row cleaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, they will do a lot of damage by
moving debris, sometimes too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: These donuts help put a uniform depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually also get wider donuts to
help if you have really sandy ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the medic down pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the airbag in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of tough to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a gauge up front with an air
compressor that you can adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually do from the cab on some
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going across the field,
you can just adjust it, increase it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or lessen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precision playing does have air force,
which will actually increase the planter
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not pushing down as hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 100 pounds of seed in the
back, it will actually press it up so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not bulldozing as much and create a
lessening sidewall compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fertilizer silo.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, this is the injector right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mounted on a spring so it moves
around like a finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very lightly fluted coulter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not moved the straight coulters
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not had that big of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our strip tiller is a 12-row, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be folded up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the six rows, it can be run as a deep
ripper if you want to run deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually told a fellow to go out there
and take away all the stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me back and said, Joe,
this just won't pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only six rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 425-horsepower tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, it won't pull it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out there and it thinks 34 inches
deep in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, that's probably why it's
not pulling it that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run about 12 to 14 inches deep,
about two inches below the plow pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do this for about two or
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to shallow it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see no need in going down 12 to 14
inches if you get rid of compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go six to eight inches where we feel
we need to put down our fertilizer because
[SPEAKER_00]: we are a banding fertilizer deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a straight shank, a lot of
parabolic shank in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just creating a slot through the
ground to break the compaction when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets drier, you can't use a
parabolic shank to kind of shatter it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plow pan, similar to concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use two front coulters that do help
size the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be an issue if you have a lot of
corn stalks, 200 bush of corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy rye residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will plug up in the shank or goes into
the two hilling coulters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have two front coulters to
size this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need to run them pretty
aggressively, especially if they will not
[SPEAKER_00]: break up.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four or five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pretty fluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're an eight wave coulter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pretty aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fertilizer, we're in about eight
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tried dual placement with some P
and K deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't tell you the results on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will say about fertilizer
going eight inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some sweet corn the first of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of rain and the corn was
about a foot and a half tall and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drive by the field and it almost went in
the ditch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was green and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out in there, I cannot figure out
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually called Donnie and we talked
about it and he said, the thing you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to realize is that these roots are about
six inches deep right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eight inches and it's so wet,
you're not going deep and you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my suggestion for all of you,
if you're going to ban fertilizer when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's early or if you have light ground,
just put it six inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the root will get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also banding fertilizer onto the
plant, which is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you, we're not side
dressing any of these crops anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not want them to stress at any time
because that will reduce your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bevel coulters in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they're pretty aggressive and
about four or five inches apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shank and the closing disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice the straight point in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, it pulls hard enough without the
parabolic shank on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our fertilizer delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a two port, or this is actually a
single port John Blue Piston pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run off of a Trimble True Guide system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from here in the Red Ball system
and then it goes into these adjustable
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer tubes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the squash, what we did is we went
in two, three weeks in advance on a
[SPEAKER_00]: phthalo soybean field from previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sprayed it down with glyphosate,
let it burn down and we actually did have
[SPEAKER_00]: the disc in some areas where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looked like directly after
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice how there are clumps of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are times when I have had to run my
row cleaners deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's very clumpy, what are you going to
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put it deeper and create
a trench and get good seed to soil
[SPEAKER_00]: contact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you going to leave it up high and
get poor seed to soil contact?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put it down deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the squash after emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice, besides the doubles here,
how uniform that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emergencies, that's what you want to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to see some just coming up
and some this high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get them all even as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually no cresting on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got rain after this and no cresting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For weed management, it's very similar to
conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference is that we had it
burned down first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used Command Post Plant and we also
used San Diego Mute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the areas that we did cultivate had
dramatically more weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, to the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: In areas that we did not cultivate,
or excuse me, areas that we did not disc,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really did not need to cultivate
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Diego did a very nice job taking out
the pigweed and nut grass and really
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have any other weed issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did cultivate because daddy said
we're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the middle of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how it's got a nice uniform
canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't ask for much more than a
squash yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our yields, you can see our strip till
it's on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conventional's on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice there are fewer squash over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more squash over here,
but more green squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carol just gave me this piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says in a 10 by 20 area,
there is fewer squash over here on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strip till and more over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these weigh more per squash than these
ones, creating a total yield advantage for
[SPEAKER_00]: these, meaning they weigh more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just got a quick slide and snap
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any nice pictures on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did do snap beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a piece right after squash,
previous year, came up fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very pleased with how they came
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not deep band any fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'll say, that we learned the
hard way, because you need to roll the
[SPEAKER_00]: snap beans, especially on the lighter
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you'll get the ridges and maybe
some small stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guys that picked that do not like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the good luck of that, we did double
crop after peas and wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we double cropped after peas,
if we planted north and south with the
[SPEAKER_00]: peas, we planted east and west.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will eliminate the windrows of the
peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pea harvesters, they windrow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go along with the row,
you're going to have a really tough time,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what you have, going through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had pretty good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, one other thing, there was a
40 acre piece, and we were going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: three and a half inches of rain or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always had them plant half a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, three or four days
later, we were planting the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: field where nobody else was doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to plant more, because we can get
in there following wheat, strip tiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's when my dad finally said,
I'm glad I went to college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed management is comparable to
conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not better, but you can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that it beats working the
ground four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my summary is the management style of
reduced tillage is drastically different
[SPEAKER_00]: than conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend less time burring
diesel in your caractacy, more time in
[SPEAKER_00]: your office.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to worry about the rotations,
herbicide, carryovers, and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you're not tilling the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not chisel plowing linemen or mold
bar plowing linemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to spread your potash in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it work down through natural gravity
and rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get some movement from the shank
and the closing discs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, there's 15 to 20 inches
that's not getting tilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your pH will rise in that top inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're soil sampling, that's
something you've got to think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where am I going to soil sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to soil sample every time in
the furrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I going to sporadically sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that is up for debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who really knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of you guys know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, first full year, we tried some.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start at your own pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not just do 1,500 acres at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year before, we did try some on sweet
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your own pace, maybe five acres and
maybe 20 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to do, don't be pushed
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't be scared about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to others and listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's actually very, very open to
conversation, as I found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, there were many times I wondered
what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I should move away, if I get kicked
out, stay positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work out in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you, Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is knocked off before everybody else
could ask some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody got any questions for him?
[SPEAKER_06]: Same question.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you do after harvest?
[SPEAKER_03]: What tillage?
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was, what does he do after
harvest for tillage?
[SPEAKER_03]: We will try to no-till on cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we will spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will spread it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen any increase in diseases or
insects because of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's our first year.
[SPEAKER_03]: After harvest, he spreads a covered crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he either lets it germinate on its
own, or sometimes he well or lightly
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporates it with a disc.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple things that Joe talked about,
the nitrogen deep crop lag getting to it
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did see that early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It concerned me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The yield results in the end on the sweet
corn when we were doing the deep-placed
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It concerned me because I could see yellow
corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: The corn was yellower where the nitrogen
was deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we got all set and done and
harvested, the yield was average almost
[SPEAKER_03]: two times the acre more on those
deep-placed nitrogen plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a concern I've been aware of and
awakened to, I guess, as of lately,
[SPEAKER_03]: is the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we improve the soil with biological
health with reduced tillage and cover
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, the soil biological activity
microbes on the surface are the most
[SPEAKER_03]: active on the top few inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need nitrogen to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're consuming the nitrogen on the
shallow part of your soil early on until
[SPEAKER_03]: things really get going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a possibility under certain
crops and certain fertility programs that
[SPEAKER_03]: you could be starving the crop of nitrogen
somewhat if you do not apply some nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: in the seed row area or close to the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe talked about weeds and cultivating and
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years ago, we had a we no till our
peas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came time to harvest a long piece
of peas, an 80 acre block of peas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got a heavy rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when it's time to harvest peas,
they don't care if it rained or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to go, and they go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a call about 2 o'clock in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed me to bring my four wheel
drive tractor down because one of the pea
[SPEAKER_03]: machines was stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really excited me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the fact that they called me 2 o'clock
in the morning excited me, but the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that one of those, I don't know,
30 ton machines or whatever was stuck out
[SPEAKER_03]: in my field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they made a pretty good mess of the
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I say, an 80 acre block.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of that, we ended up doing some
remedial tillage on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After the fact, when it dragged out some
with a disc, trying to level the ruts out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That fall, we follow peas with winter
wheat, no till the wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to go out and do a burndown before
we plant to control the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anywhere we ran the disc over the
ground to level the ground out,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got the ground leveled out and looked
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that field or that farm has a very
high seed population of lamb's quarters,
[SPEAKER_03]: and about the only place the lamb's
quarters grew was everywhere we ran the
[SPEAKER_03]: disc.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the thickest carpet of lamb's
quarters, and it was right to the line
[SPEAKER_03]: where we ran the disc on all those spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went all spot disc, if you want to say,
all the ruts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: What tillage wakens those seeds up,
if you want to say, and brings them to
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rain and field operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing that not working this soil,
tearing it up, that you get a rainfall on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: An inch of rain could disappear pretty
fast on that ground, where a field next to
[SPEAKER_03]: you that they've been tilled up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even want to get close to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been several times that the
processor has got a hold of us after a
[SPEAKER_03]: rain to either plant some sweet corn
because nobody else can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matter of fact, this past spring,
a year ago, I was out planting sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: One Monday morning, they called me up and
said, you know, you've got 50 acres of
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet corn you're supposed to plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you think you can go?
[SPEAKER_03]: He dropped in his seat when I told him I'm
out going now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it rained, and nobody else can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've called me up different times and
said, you know, we've had a lot of rain,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're having trouble everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about your black trade
clock?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, it shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go out and, you know, no problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tired track, a little tired track.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lug marks, but other than that,
goes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Joe did alert to the fact that you might
not spend as much time in that tractor
[SPEAKER_03]: seat as you had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might not burn as much fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're going to spend more time is
sitting in the chair in the office,
[SPEAKER_03]: management.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably one of the biggest things
or biggest, what do I want to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: time vacuums, if you want to say,
is much more management goes into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conventional tillage, you go out,
you plow it, you fit it, you plant it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you're going to do with this
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're always looking at new ways to
improve the bottom line, increase your
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiency, but I can't stress enough that
management is much, much bigger part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the puzzle than is first led to be thought
of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said enough on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to have Casey Coombs give
us an overview of their operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey's the operation manager at
Hemptondale Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversified farm with approximately 3,000
acres of cabbage, green beans,
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet corn, vine crops, field corn,
alfalfa, and wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also operate a 700-cow dairy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do read in the country, folks,
even though I'm not a dairy producer or a
[SPEAKER_03]: produce milk, but I always look at the
production, go through and they,
[SPEAKER_03]: every month when they put the production
report in there, how far we're going,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I go through the counties and the
people that I recognize and they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: very respectable production record.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also have some robotic milkers
there too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey's responsibilities include
coordinating day-to-day cropping
[SPEAKER_03]: enterprises, overseeing equipment
operations, maintenance, repair,
[SPEAKER_03]: replacement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reduced tillage is a new effort on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been working at it for a few years
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Casey and I have had quite a few
conversations over the years, and Dale,
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Casey, it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Don.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start off by thanking you for
all the time and effort that you've put in
[SPEAKER_02]: and your willingness to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people have called and
it's really helpful getting someone else's
[SPEAKER_02]: experience has been in a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: First slide kind of speaks about our
philosophy and how important soil health
[SPEAKER_02]: is to our farm and the crops and the
animals that we have there.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Don mentioned, we've been at it a few
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gradually worked into this reduced
tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of started by ripping in the
fall, again, to rip up some of this
[SPEAKER_02]: compaction created from vegetable harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you mentioned, when it's time
to harvest the vegetables, you have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter what the weather is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can really destroy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started out that way with deep
ripping in the fall, and then we'd go to
[SPEAKER_02]: just field cultivating in the spring,
and destroying the cover crop or burning
[SPEAKER_02]: it down, and then gradually work through
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some points I want to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it, I think, has been reiterated
here, and I think it's on kind of common
[SPEAKER_02]: themes from listening to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mulberry plowing, we feel, really addicts
the soil to excessive tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of perpetuates more tillage being
needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do start going to reduce tillage,
you've got to commit work for two to three
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a while to start this soil
renewing process before you'll see the
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Joe says, you've got to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires more management.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same thing Don mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does take more managing cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The size of the cover crop, when you're
going to burn it down, make it easier to
[SPEAKER_02]: work, especially with a trans planter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't lend itself quite as well to
roll cleaners and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So managing that size of the residue that
you're working with is more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you want to be planting over the
slot, that requires a GPS, which takes a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more time to get used to,
especially your first year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a learning curve there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the soil will improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen this action on the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen more earthworm activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got pictures that will show the
results that we see when we're harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do a lot of plowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people used to do a lot of
plowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how you took care of the cover crop
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unless the conditions were just
perfect and the moisture just right,
[SPEAKER_02]: it took a lot to get that to fit back down
again so that you could plant well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still doing once in a while,
we'll plow bean field.
[SPEAKER_02]: A new mention, she actually maybe has seen
a yield drag in beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all the other crops, the yield has
stayed consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we've seen with the rest
of the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: With beans, some things are still getting
our best yield with plowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plowed one field last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a heavy side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a run in field, a new field to
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't think a strip tiller would work
well in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have some good beans off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this being our first year of following
over the zone with our planter,
[SPEAKER_02]: our beans on the rest of our ground
reduced tillage has been much better than
[SPEAKER_02]: it has been previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we just were going with the field
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows our following with our field
cultivator after we've made a pass with
[SPEAKER_02]: the zone building.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're doing cabbage, we still feel we
need the trough land for weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're still incorporating trough land
after we'll make a pass with the zone
[SPEAKER_02]: builder to put down the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows a pass of zone building going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, we are set up to put liquid
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting down a different amount
depending on what the crop history is,
[SPEAKER_02]: what our soil tests are, and what our
yield expectations are.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we mentioned before, it does take some
more management, managing the residue and
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the GPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's real critical to keep a net
planter over the zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: This here is actually a picture of what we
do in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some questions of what people
are doing in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the fall, we'll go through and that's
where we'll rip.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still finding 12 to 14 inches deep
in the fall to get below, to break up a
[SPEAKER_02]: compacted layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our same machine that we do the
zone building with in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the spring, it's a 12 row unit running
more like 8 to 10 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Putting down the liquid, we'll have the
rolling baskets and the discs behind it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take off the two outside shanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little harder to pull it at 14
inches deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking off the rolling baskets and
the discs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, we're pulling an airway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that helps incorporate the
manure that we might put on in some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and also a cover crop that we'll
put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll help incorporate that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shows what an established cover
crop will look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to try to destroy the cover crop
when it's 6 to 9 inches tall as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the overall soil management once
we get going with zone tillage is then
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to manage the compaction as we go
through our operations and harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the ways that we do that to help
minimize it is with track vehicles and
[SPEAKER_02]: with flotation tires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don was mentioning it's in the harvest
time, especially when it's wet,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you can really visually see the
difference between conventional tilled
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and zone tilled fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to custom harvest beans and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a world of difference between
conventional till and zone till.
[SPEAKER_02]: This here was a conventional till field of
cabbage near us.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was us operating the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a little track there where we had
a tram line where we'd be bringing back
[SPEAKER_02]: from the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would follow the same path back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can see, all there is is just a
little bit of the real tread shown from
[SPEAKER_02]: the harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get much better water infiltration and
the soil structure improves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way you can measure and see the
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal is to get away from something
like that in the fall and to end up
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil will improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes some time to see it when you're
first transitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really well worth it at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I'll take any questions if
anybody has any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple points Casey was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water infiltration part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that in our operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what really hit the home run with
me when I have landlords that make the
[SPEAKER_03]: comment to me that I don't know what
you're doing but it must be right because
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have water that ponds on our land
anymore like the neighbors do across the
[SPEAKER_03]: road that are conventionally tilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're paying attention and watching
what you're doing and make positive
[SPEAKER_03]: remarks like that or my garden doesn't get
flooded anymore when it rains because the
[SPEAKER_03]: water used to run out of the field prior
years, come down the edge of the road and
[SPEAKER_03]: fill my yard and garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Snow geese don't have a pond to land on
anymore in my field because we don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: a pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these reduced till tools,
turbo desk, turbo till, NRCS if you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: one of their programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these they don't view real
friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Case IH turbo desk, I know there's
some areas that they call it a full width
[SPEAKER_03]: tillage tool I guess even though this last
fall we had our new district manager for
[SPEAKER_03]: our county.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was applying for the conservation
stewardship program and we put cover crops
[SPEAKER_03]: after our sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have a turbo desk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell people I might have to rename that
just to a turbo and forget the desk but
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to come out and do a field and
farm survey to check things and I took
[SPEAKER_03]: them around to some of these fields where
we put the cover crop on after the sweet
[SPEAKER_03]: corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: We air flow it on, mix it with potash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally we put potash, sometimes a
little ammonium sulfate but we'll air flow
[SPEAKER_03]: the cover crop and some fertilizer on.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get even distribution that way and then
we run over the ground with the turbo,
[SPEAKER_03]: approximately two inches deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done this for two years now and the
cover crop establishment with this tool is
[SPEAKER_03]: just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he came out for the farm survey I
took him around to some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I had to show him all the fields
and took him to the fields where we put
[SPEAKER_03]: the cover crop on and ran over it with the
turbo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very impressed with the amount of
residue that was left on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had good coverage and all that but the
powers to be above them are the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: really make the decision now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in lesser publications,
there's no till farm magazine,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an article about it that some of
these minimum till tools and NRCS's view
[SPEAKER_03]: on them is not very favorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe more of us need to start making
noise about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's places out there that I could see
very rolling, hilly ground where maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: this tool would not be advisable to use
but there's a lot of other places where
[SPEAKER_03]: they can be very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I'm turning over to Ron Wagner
from Wagner Farms in Rome, New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ron has 35 acres of mixed vegetables and
they're known for their potatoes,
[SPEAKER_03]: farm stand, farmers markets, greenhouse,
plant sales in the spring, you pick
[SPEAKER_03]: currants, raspberries and gooseberries,
homemade wreaths and Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ron, I'm going to turn the table over
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started farming about 1998 officially.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was farming for about five years before
that, involved with FFA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of you probably were too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have fought the system 100% all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Started out a couple acres here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Had a little muck farm, bought a small
tractor, a couple small pieces of
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gradually I moved up in the world and got
into a little larger scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Around 2006, we were running about 75
acres of crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Running it all in one tractor,
working 18 hour days, 180 days a year at
[SPEAKER_05]: least.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2006 was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a bad year.
[SPEAKER_05]: As many of us know, it was a very wet
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had many floods and I, despite having
crops when no one else did, I went
[SPEAKER_05]: bankrupt and thought that was the end of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2007 was bankrupts a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mom took over the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ran the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Covered the bills, covered the expenses
out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2008, I started with a clean slate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was able to keep all my equipment,
keep everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started looking at ways of conserving
money and making things more economical.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2008, fertilizer prices started pushing
almost a thousand dollars a ton towards
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of the seed growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: Conventional tillage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was my main tillage tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going in, parading with the plow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, in 2008, I downsized a muck
load.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was down to 35 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big load off the tractor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The conventional tillage method I was
using at the time was moldboard plowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, I started out with big,
heavy sided disks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, big, heavy sided disks,
you had to go over it two or three times
[SPEAKER_05]: and make them look good and try to fit the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gradually transitioned over to a Feffa
II field cultivator, which I love and to
[SPEAKER_05]: this day, I use almost 90% of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very rarely do I use a set of disks in the
field any longer, except for in the fall
[SPEAKER_05]: if I'm trying to chop down stubble or chew
up residue.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of going to a reduced tillage
seed system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back around 2005, I sort of messed around
with it via a subsoiler and trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: eliminate some compaction layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that on a tomato crop that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of the best tomato crops ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It went in subsoil the whole entire field,
laid the mulch, did everything we could.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a dry summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tomatoes did phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did not drop stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: We irrigated once or twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we had to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: By going over the subsoiler, I went 28
inches deep with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hit it really hard, really deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave those roots of those plants the
opportunity to go deep on their own,
[SPEAKER_05]: to find the water source, to find the
moisture, to find the nutrients that have
[SPEAKER_05]: leached down deep in the soil over the
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that point, I became convinced that
going to reduced or to get the root system
[SPEAKER_05]: down deeper in this ground was a priority.
[SPEAKER_05]: This past year, in 2010, I had the
opportunity to use a universe 130 zone
[SPEAKER_05]: roller from
[SPEAKER_05]: Freeville.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried it on sweet corn and cucumbers
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sweet corn, I did it on my white sweet
corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it on a second and third planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it right next to the second or first
planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had white sweet corn on
conventional tilled soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a side-by-side comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: The white sweet corn that was on the zone
build didn't lodge, didn't fall over,
[SPEAKER_05]: yielded just as well as this conventional.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the conventional lodged.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't do anything different than the
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We used broadcast on our fertilizer
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do some liquid in furrow when we plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time I did the first planting,
the second and third planting of white
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet corn, I did the cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not have success with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave that to the fact that we had heavy
rains just after we planted.
[SPEAKER_05]: The small seed of cucumber actually wound
up being washed down in the soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: down in the subsoil, which is deeper than
I should have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also believe the soil crusted just a
little on top, which hindered it from
[SPEAKER_05]: germinating correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Later this summer, this past summer,
I decided we could get this on-growth
[SPEAKER_05]: again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We decided we were going to do our full
entire fall crop of cold crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage,
Chinese cabbage, kohlrabi, you name it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went a little excessive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't plant on the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I going to use it for originally?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go in and spray it with Roundup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had because it would have saved a
lot of energy and a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, I went up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The day I went ahead and chiseled out the
field, I dissed it twice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran the perfecto over it with a roller.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got it all nice, uniform, flat,
weed free.
[SPEAKER_05]: The following day I went over it with the
zone getter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on builder two rows.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was running 14 inches deep in the
ground, which is about two inches below my
[SPEAKER_05]: compaction layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was running around five miles an hour
with a 55 horse tractor, four wheel drive,
[SPEAKER_05]: fully loaded with weights.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of equipment on the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I sat on the ground,
I didn't even know it was there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just pulled so nice and easy in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: The field I went with for the kohlcrops
has a problem though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Conventional plowing of it is hard because
the top end is a clay loam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go down the middle and it's clay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those two, the depth control is pretty
decent at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can control it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get the plows in the ground,
even in the dry weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the far end is a gravel knoll.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the gravel, the hard pan and
the gravel layer plows right up out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you get in the ground two or three
inches at the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: The zone builder, however, we got down 14
inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: We stayed at 14 inches right through that
gravel knoll.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: This might actually transplant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, conventional and standard
transplanters, you want your soil to be
[SPEAKER_05]: plowed pretty deep for the transplanter to
actually work the way it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the gravel knoll, the transplanter was
usually, okay, lift it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to plant here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just turn around, go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, we wound up planting right from
one end of the field to the other,
[SPEAKER_05]: right through that gravel knoll with no
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Day after I zone built that field,
we had approximately two to three inches
[SPEAKER_05]: of rain that following day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, the zone builder got
picked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be hurting here because I
can't get back in that field.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be all crusted over
conventionally until the field would have
[SPEAKER_05]: been crusted over completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would have been impossible to go in
with the transplanter and transplant on
[SPEAKER_05]: top of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, taking a risk, we put the
transplanter on about five days after we
[SPEAKER_05]: zone built it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started transplanting at about three o
'clock in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: By nightfall, we were three quarters of
the way done planting, and we had no
[SPEAKER_05]: problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It stayed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: The zones were nice and fluffy,
full width of the baskets, which I think
[SPEAKER_05]: we're running about 12 inches wide on the
baskets.
[SPEAKER_05]: The zone itself was 14 inches.
[SPEAKER_05]: Took a metal rod out of a couple of spots,
pushed it down through.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: 14, 15 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Transplanter were perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went in and irrigated the following
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We set irrigation on the field,
and we ran about three quarters of an inch
[SPEAKER_05]: of rain on the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did this for three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could move the sprinklers around it
over the three-day period.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got it all wired in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have to irrigate again for an
hour or two weeks after that, and this was
[SPEAKER_05]: in the middle of a pretty dry spell,
and the end of July we had.
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, I would have had to irrigate it
two or three times, probably five days
[SPEAKER_05]: apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It saved me a lot of headaches.
[SPEAKER_05]: The benefit to the zone building was that
once that surface was sealed, it kept the
[SPEAKER_05]: moisture in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allowed the roots to go down deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It allowed them to find the moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, at the same time, the zone
building, we had broadcasted fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_05]: so the fertilizer was already in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't use any water or liquid
fertilizer at the time of transplanting,
[SPEAKER_05]: which was a risk at the time, but it paid
off.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cold crop did phenomenal this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: About halfway through the growing season
in August, we had one weekend where we got
[SPEAKER_05]: four inches of rain in one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Normally, that field would pull up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have 12 inches of water sitting in
the lower spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the crop is lost, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no water standing in the field at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: The spot where normally the bees pulled
up, the tire tracks had a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: water standing in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rows themselves were quite muddy,
but the tire tracks, you could actually
[SPEAKER_05]: walk on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually drive on them if you
had to.
[SPEAKER_05]: The harvest came in about September.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started picking broccoli and cabbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: The broccoli heads we were hauling out of
that field were 10 to 12 inch diameter,
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvested it every three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cabbage was averaging six to eight
pound size.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were wholesaling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were retailing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farmers market, you name it, we were doing
it with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone loved the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have to worry about being
selective about picking it for once.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have to worry about it because in
the past, I've had broccoli lodge on me
[SPEAKER_05]: for a long time.
I didn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Harvestability of crops, crop loss,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 1996, when we first started
experimenting with zone till, the only
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet corn that ever got bypassed in the
field above and beyond excess yields was
[SPEAKER_03]: some conventional we had one year that the
quality wasn't good enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when we were still in the
transition phase, if you want to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of our acreage was conventional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of it was zone tilled because I
wasn't quite brave enough to go all the
[SPEAKER_03]: way yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one particular year, we had some
conventional sweet corn that got bypassed
[SPEAKER_03]: because the quality and yield was not good
enough, but yet all of our zone tilled
[SPEAKER_03]: corn got harvested that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was the year I finally
decided that enough's enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving up on the conventional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed the soil or root the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The soil contact is critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you do to the ground,
you need to have good contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seedbed preparation is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to hear from Jim Wilson
from Wilson Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Farms, 600 acres in New Hampshire with
32 acres of Lexington, Maine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maine is located in Michigan from Boston,
12 miles from Boston.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grows pumpkins, squash, sweet corn,
carrots, and crops on raised beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim has a subsoiler, but those pesky rocks
were a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: He now has a straight shank unreferred
stone builder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a compaction problem and has,
this one's throwing me a little fight,
[SPEAKER_03]: taff or capsicum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't good in English.
[SPEAKER_03]: French, I never took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Italian or Latin or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreaded root crown and fruit disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has done three years of classic zone
tillage in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_03]: The system works well for pumpkins,
squash, sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He uses zone till on raised beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farm has 75 crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he's diversified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago, he lost 80% of his carrots.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, after planting them on
zone-built beds, he had to buy bigger bags
[SPEAKER_03]: because the carrots were too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this, I'll turn it over to Jim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The advantage to going last here is that
basically everything you wanted to say has
[SPEAKER_06]: already been said.
[SPEAKER_06]: We farm about 600 acres in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up there, we do the classic crops all
over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Larger space-consuming crops are all up
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally, what everybody else has spoken
about today is the type of thing that we
[SPEAKER_06]: do.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Lexington, we've been farming for 127
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get three crops a season off of every
bit of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow a lot of quick turnover,
smaller crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Between the two farms, we do about 125
different crops, basically raising
[SPEAKER_06]: everything we can for our retail stores at
both locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be our fourth year in New
Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's worked so well up there with what
we've been doing that we decided we've had
[SPEAKER_06]: some serious compaction issues in
Lexington.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we're turning over the land three
crops per season is a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awful lot of tractor trips.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hadn't heard of anybody doing this type
of an application, but we're gamblers like
[SPEAKER_06]: every farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We bought a second machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tossed our three shanks together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can put three rips on a five-foot bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's improved drainage tremendously.
[SPEAKER_06]: You walk across the farm and you forget
that you forget after a wet period and
[SPEAKER_06]: step on that plastic, your foot will
disappear.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also noticed huge improvements in
irrigation issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's some of the economic analysis
the people I've heard earlier today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you've talked about total
yields, etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: We found that the products are coming off
cleaner and better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pumpkins are cleaner in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lettuce this year, hot, dry seedlings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do them all from transplants,
128 plugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We throw them right into these zones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do them by hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We transplant them right behind these.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we would do in this application,
we have them put in plastic as you see
[SPEAKER_06]: here, and what we would do is we would
come down once with the bedder,
[SPEAKER_06]: prepare the ground once with the bedder,
right down with the zone tilt,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the bedder the opposite direction
to smooth off the bed and then seed as we
[SPEAKER_06]: always would.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not have a single head of lettuce
bolt this summer and in a hot,
[SPEAKER_06]: dry year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Generally you plant a 128 plug and you
grind it up after you've harvested and you
[SPEAKER_06]: see basically the same plug with a few
little hair roots sticking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year I got down a couple of times and
dug out as best I could with my hands and
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd find root zones that were beyond the
canopy of the lettuce and I think that had
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole lot to do with the fact that you
didn't have anything bolted.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a long-term view of what we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all zucchini field and this is
going to be, we run down with the plastic
[SPEAKER_06]: right behind the zone tilt.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get to the end of the field,
turn it around and come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Biggest mistake we made this year,
as I said, as was said in the previous
[SPEAKER_06]: notes, a couple years ago I had a field
that I didn't have, very limited as to
[SPEAKER_06]: where I could plant on this 30 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put my carrots in, what I knew was a
pretty poor spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a heavy, wet year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost probably 80% of our carrot crop to
forking and I sent it out for analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sure it was nematode and it came
back clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nothing but soil compaction,
which is really what prompted us to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: figure a solution here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This year the carrots came I've been using
that same bag to sell carrots in my market
[SPEAKER_06]: for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first year we could barely
seal the bag because of the length of the
[SPEAKER_06]: carrots and I think when you talk in
economic analysis too, a carrot that's
[SPEAKER_06]: three inches longer is going to be 20%
heavier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the tonnage you're taking out of a
field, it just makes sense that that would
[SPEAKER_06]: be a definite improvement.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see a close-up of the same type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only that, these carrots,
that bag is 16 inches long.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are 14 inches long and they're not
horsey at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, very tender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomatoes I noticed this year with the
crop, we did it just as we did with the
[SPEAKER_06]: zucchini.
[SPEAKER_06]: They rip right underneath the plastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I went to, first of all we had the
best crop of tomatoes I've ever seen and
[SPEAKER_06]: one of the things about it was it was a
good tomato year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hot, it was dry, they were early,
but the vigor on the plants was
[SPEAKER_06]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I noticed when we finally finished the
end of the season, we got to be on frost,
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to go out and chop them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It took me two more passes with the
rotavere to grind up the vines because the
[SPEAKER_06]: root system was that much larger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd noticed little things in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd walk by a field of beets and at
noontime in the heat of the day you'd see
[SPEAKER_06]: it's just slightly wilted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Normally you'd just grab some irrigation
pipes and run at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, you got busy, I was running drip
that day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came back at four o'clock and they were
standing straight up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sun just that little bit, little bit
cooler, little bit better condition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you don't have to panic quite as
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're finding, again I think a huge part
besides the fuel and the time savings as
[SPEAKER_06]: far as setting fields up is obviously also
that the fact that you do not have to
[SPEAKER_06]: irrigate anywhere near as much of the
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: The root systems justify themselves and I
think the quality of the plants is the
[SPEAKER_06]: biggest part.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really that's about all I had to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the heavy hitter was taken by the
guys in front of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: But are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a heavy loam.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the heavy loam in Lexington.
[SPEAKER_06]: New Hampshire is a sandy loam.
[SPEAKER_06]: In New Hampshire we're down on the
Maryland River, just right on the river.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are going to be raised, those happen
to be flat beds for the zucchini.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything else is grown on raised
beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're growing things like,
I didn't mention, baby spinach.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a 24 day turnover from seed to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has got to be 100% clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any debris in the field, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're forced to be,
we've always been high tail.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use no herbicides at all on the farm in
Lexington.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cultivate a tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know what the detriments are to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're bringing high value crops off
and we feel we can control it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kept the farm clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extremely rare to see any weeds go to
seed at all on the Lexington farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: We patrol it every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went right to three.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were trying to lay out, to save some
money I was thinking, well maybe two is
[SPEAKER_06]: the number.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we could pull it with a little bit
less horsepower.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my guy who does most of my tractor
work for me, he said, no, if you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: do it, do it all, both feet in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad we did.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many rows of carrots do you have on
that bed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Three rows on the bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 40 inches at the top of the bed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three rips and three rows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you're doing, what's the sequence
of events when you're building a raised
[SPEAKER_08]: bed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Say that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at the beginning of the season we
would plow as always.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'd prepare the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd flatten it out with a power arrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you'd come down once with the bedder.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then rip the bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a little bit uneven because of
the ripping process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then one more pass with the bedder and
then seed as normal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you put the plastic on at that
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, either plastic or bare ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't been too soft for going in with
like baby spinach on the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that second pass with the bedder
that's just enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't settle.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, surprisingly, if you get a rain
immediately after or generally,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a small scale farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would normally seed and honestly
move the pipes in and overhead irrigate
[SPEAKER_06]: within a half an hour plant trying to get
germination out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't see any, you know,
nothing falls down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any questions for any other
speakers before everybody bowels out?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good opportunity to ask them
questions if you have any.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'd like to know what for some of
you you think you might try next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see changing anything or doing
anything new or different this next year?
[SPEAKER_06]: We did 100, I mean, we generally jump both
feet when we jump.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did, every bed on the farm was done
this way last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it was a dry year.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can almost guarantee this
year will be a wet year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to find out what the
differences are and you make all those
[SPEAKER_06]: small adjustments after.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to try a little bit
of cabbage and some broccoli this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try some cabbage and
broccoli this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, we grow a couple acres of beet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start messing around
with a few things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only because, like I say, everything we've
tried it on, we've loved it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't see any reason not to try it on
everything eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the first year that with the
GPS we'll be able to follow in the spring
[SPEAKER_02]: the slot that we cut in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be putting on our liquid
fertilizer and doing our zone building
[SPEAKER_02]: right over the same slot we cut in the
fall and then of course following the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant for the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably banding fertilizer in for all
this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the big thing we're going to do is
I got another planter coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do twin rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try twin rows and follow
over the zone behind the zone tiller or
[SPEAKER_03]: strip tiller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compare that to our 30 inch rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be seven or eight inches
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we drive right, they'll be
straddling the strip.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to try to compare apples to
apples as best we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the planter set up so that the
fertility program is the same as our 30
[SPEAKER_03]: inch row planter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously try pushing some
populations above and beyond that on
[SPEAKER_03]: another replicated strip somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to compare what I'm doing now with
a twin row and see if there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement and then try any advancements
from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet corn, soy beans, grain corn.
[SPEAKER_08]: How far apart would the rows be between
the twin rows?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be centered at 30 inch
rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be approximately 22
inches between the rows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll still be able to get down through
with the row crop sprayer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always looking and trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well I tried a year ago to several
equipment companies to see if we could get
[SPEAKER_03]: one to do, I mean I call this an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a $50,000 experiment going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: God, things were good to me last year so I
was able to justify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I decided I was going to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to wait and try to check
the equipment companies again and see if
[SPEAKER_03]: or see what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to go to a 12 row deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to sell me a 12 row unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I buy something I want to buy
something for the future and not something
[SPEAKER_03]: for yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at the newest technology
and if the equipment company recommends
[SPEAKER_03]: this and what they recommend, I kind of go
by recommendations or talking with other
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to the transition phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're transitioning for the future and not
for the history behind us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes there's not a lot of
opportunity to check with people or to
[SPEAKER_03]: find out what works and what doesn't work
or what to buy and what not to buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes you have to go out on a limb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Myself, I hope it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I fall in love with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the bailout, I hope somebody else likes
it better than I do so I can get rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But fortunately for us, you know,
what we've done it's all worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't work, find out why it didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: As was said here, Joe and Casey and Ron
and Jim and that, don't be afraid to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: to people that are doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your best source of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people out there that are doing
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to these national hotel conferences
and there's people from around the world
[SPEAKER_03]: that come to these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, not everything works the same
everywhere but you'll find different
[SPEAKER_03]: pockets around the country, around the
world that go through the same situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: same circumstances that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you go out in Ohio now and you
talk about no-till coalers or road
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaners.
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of the people out in Ohio,
they certainly have God's dirt because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're taking all these attachments off.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just going out with a planter and
planting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know from past experience,
we can't do that on our soil here in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to add all those options on there
to get back to that seed to soil contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fertility management.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of growers out west now,
you know, the big talk is starter
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizer or what do you need to have for
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our fertility is good enough but
now test results are coming in,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, comparisons that the little
starter fertilizer is showing some
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits, particularly phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get phosphorus by that seed, you know,
get it going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go on for the rest of the night if
I wanted but I'm supposed to adjourn at
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.30.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's any other questions or
anybody here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do the evaluation and remember if
you're interested in the demo,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's some sign-up sheets on the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Dan.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
