[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm going to talk to you today a
little bit about development of a frost
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy maize variety and a lot about
assembling a trypsium genome so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can map frost tolerance in trypsium from
the remote here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so just to motivate the project,
plants with longer growing seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate more biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at light capture efficiency
and miscanthus and maize and side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: replicated field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that miscanthus due to emerging
earlier and senescing later in the season
[SPEAKER_00]: is able to maximize foliar canopy cover
throughout the growing season and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially do more photosynthesis,
resulting in 59% greater productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we emulate this in maize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so this is just a zoom in of the
corn belts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at NDVI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It averaged over a two-week window at the
end of four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I cycle through here, we can see the
greenness in this kind of area right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the corn belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really kick in until the end of
July, which is after the summer solstice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically half of our growing season is
gone before maize really gets kicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if we could develop a cold-tolerant
maize variety, it could potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: overwinter in the southeastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be sown earlier in the corn belt
in its main growing season, potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: getting its canopy out earlier and making
better use of the growing season and also
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be grown further north that
potentially has a spring crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to study freezing tolerance
and potentially identify traits to move
[SPEAKER_00]: over to maize, we're looking at this
species called trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm realizing just now that I don't have a
nice picture of trypsicum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some pictures of sad trypsicum a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big bushy grass, but at the
seedling stage, it looks a lot like maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trypsicum overwinters in temperate
climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two main species that are endemic
to North America, trypsicum dactyloides
[SPEAKER_00]: and trypsicum floridonum.
[SPEAKER_00]: See their distributions down on the bottom
right-hand side of the plot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to stand right in front of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it possesses a great degree of
natural variation for freezing tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which exceeds that of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very closely related to maize,
having diverged around 1.2 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and it shares a whole genome
duplication event with maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're even cross-compatible,
although it's very tricky to get a viable
[SPEAKER_00]: cross out of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hasn't undergone a domestication
bottleneck, although I'll point out the
[SPEAKER_00]: trypsicum floridonum is isolated to
basically the southern tip of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole state's highlighted here,
but really it's just down in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: counties down in the southern tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that population actually did undergo
not a domestication bottleneck,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we expect that the hypothesis is that
in the last ice age, essentially it was
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped in a refugia on the southern tip
of Florida there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we expect it to have a much smaller
effective population size than trypsicum
[SPEAKER_00]: dactyloides, which is found from North
America all the way through Central
[SPEAKER_00]: America and down into South America with
Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are natural populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to talk a little bit about the
mapping population here, this is largely
[SPEAKER_00]: the work of Christy Galtz and Nick Lepic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christy Galtz was a former postdoc in the
Buckler Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially we had a number of trypsicum
dactyloides and trypsicum floridonum
[SPEAKER_00]: collections that were made by Denise
Kostich, who was our former lab manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a series of crosses were made between
northern varieties of trypsicum
[SPEAKER_00]: dactyloides and then trypsicum floridonum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were made reciprocally, but
essentially we just picked the F1s that
[SPEAKER_00]: were viable and we selected one plant per
family from each viable cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up with 53 F1s that were then
clonally propagated.
[SPEAKER_00]: As trypsicum is a perennial, you can just
basically cut it in half and plant the two
[SPEAKER_00]: halves and you have a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the F1s have been allowed to open
pollinate in the field for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we collect the seed off of those F1s
and we use that for our freezing screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're taking a bulk segregant analysis
approach here where we subject the F2
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, which has been germinated under
greenhouse conditions, to first cold
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation followed by essentially a hard
frost at minus 8 degrees C overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature slowly ramps down and they get
three hours of hard freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them recover a little bit and then
we phenotype them basically for their
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance of green leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see some sad plants on the left
in the susceptible bulk and happy plants
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right in the tolerant bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take essentially the tails of the
phenotype distribution, we pull tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we sequence them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the question arises, what do we map
them to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible to map these reeds to
maize, but as I said before, the genomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: while they have a lot in common,
there's fundamentally different
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trypsicum has 18 chromosomes and a 3.5
gigabase genome, while maize has a 2.3
[SPEAKER_00]: gigabase genome and only 10 chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that motivates me to try to assemble a
Trypsicum genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the technology we picked was Nanopore
reeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the Trypsicum and maize
genomes are highly repetitive,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 85 or greater percent repeat
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes short reed assembly a
challenge, or at least an expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanopore reeds can reach lengths of up to
200 base pairs, 200,000 base pairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so can potentially span intergenic
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at on the bottom
right here, where it says maize intergenic
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, that's a distribution of the
distance between consecutive sets of maize
[SPEAKER_00]: genes in the B73 genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the top, we're looking at the
distribution of min-ion reeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can see that they nicely cover the
intergenic region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a technology that can
potentially span those gaps and allow us
[SPEAKER_00]: to assemble structurally a complete
Trypsicum genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drawback for Nanopore reeds is their
high error rate of around 15%,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is far worse than Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, there are new algorithms
that are designed to account for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so about 30x of long reeds greater
than 10 kb is what is typically
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended for assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you the results we've gotten
using that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick overview of our assembly
pipeline here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with our long reeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feed those into a software program
called WTDBG2, which is incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried a number of other assembly
algorithms, including Canoe, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more well-known, MiniSM,
Fly, and then MeCat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially with the size of this data
set, we're talking about 100 gigabases of
[SPEAKER_00]: reeds or 200 gigabytes worth of files.
[SPEAKER_00]: The memory requirements for overlapping
all of the reeds against each other were
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited, so none of the other
approaches worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: WTDBG2 not only worked, but it worked
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out from WTDBG, we get raw contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just sort of draft, still high error
rate contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we take the long reeds
and we map them back to those contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a program called Raycon to
essentially call consensus in the contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That improves the accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this iteratively one to three
times while the accuracy continues to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk in a moment about how we
benchmark that accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final step is to throw some short
reeds on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those short Illumina low error rate
reeds and use those to correct the
[SPEAKER_00]: residual base pair error, any base pairing
accuracies that remain in the Raycon
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out from that, we get corrected
contigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These typically are much more fragmented
than a chromosome scale assembly,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they do contain a lot of structural
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so yeah, the performance of that
whole pipeline depends a lot on genome
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and the input data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a collaboration that we did with
Ilad Orin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an Amit Ghor's group from Hebrew U.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a much smaller, less complex
genome than Tripsicum or Maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 450 megabases with far lower repeat
contents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30x worth of long reed coverage and
this is 13 and a half gigabases,
[SPEAKER_00]: which works out to roughly one minion flow
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very small amount of data for
the nanopore.
[SPEAKER_00]: By contrast, we need about 10,
well, seven to 10, depending on yields of
[SPEAKER_00]: these flow cells to get the same coverage
for a genome the size of Maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so the resource usage in terms of
compute time is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a medium memory CVSU, a high
performance computer or computing server,
[SPEAKER_00]: it took about 500 CPU hours, but just in
terms of wall clock time, this ran in
[SPEAKER_00]: about a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assembly size was about 85% of
what was expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when aligning this assembly to the
Cucumis mellow reference, we can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's generally collinear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of off diagonal,
but it aligns very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tiles most of the assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here on the right,
we're looking at a BUSCO plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is, BUSCO stands for
Benchmarking Universal Single Copy
[SPEAKER_00]: Orthologues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just telling you how many of the
single copy genes that are conserved
[SPEAKER_00]: within the embryophyta seed plants are
present and correctly assembled within
[SPEAKER_00]: your assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see that for the reference
genome versus the polished assembly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have very similar numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just looking at the size of the blue
bar versus the red bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks very good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Mays P39 and Trypsium Floridanum,
these are two assemblies that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mays P39 more as a test case because it's
inbred and we have a closer reference in
[SPEAKER_00]: B73.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compute time is substantially longer,
but the clock time is again only one to
[SPEAKER_00]: two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really talking about very rapid
genome assembly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the continuity we get out of these is
not quite as good as we get with the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, less repetitive genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are getting 400 kilobases worth of
contigs or 400 kilobases and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's saying half of our assembly is
in contigs that size or larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so again, another BUSCO plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at these two assemblies,
Mays P39 and Trypsium Floridanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just looking at the improvement
of the BUSCO score as we iteratively
[SPEAKER_00]: polish with Raycon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the assembly doesn't
much improve with repeated rounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: Raycon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we throw the short reads on there
with pylon, we get close to the reference
[SPEAKER_00]: completeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true for Trypsium
Floridanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is some work that Baoxeng Song,
my colleague, postdoc in the Buckler Lab
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He designed an alternative to BUSCO called
Tabasco, where we basically take a wider
[SPEAKER_00]: set of genes from the endropogoniae,
so more specific to Mays and Trypsium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we align them at the nucleotide level
rather than at the protein level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a little bit less sensitive to
base pair errors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that essentially the gene
space that is not being picked up by BUSCO
[SPEAKER_00]: as complete is actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even before we polish anything,
we do have the building blocks of a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way that we can rapidly check
where our assemblies are at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us with tuning parameters and
iterating.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so then just a couple of whole genome
alignments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have these assemblies,
we want to know how good we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take our assemblies and we align
them against some kind of reference,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I showed before, with Cucumus mello
versus the reference genome there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are, again, the Mays P39 assembly
and the Trypsium Floridanum assembly
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned against the Mays P73.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our sort of platinum quality
reference genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that the features are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't have time to get into
what's going on in these little red
[SPEAKER_00]: circles here, but essentially there's a
lot of duplication in the Mays genome
[SPEAKER_00]: inherently, as I said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're picking it up in both the
Trypsium and the Mays assemblies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the thing I'm going to have to
dig into a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another characteristic to note is that
this is slightly darker red and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: more orange here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have higher percent identity in the
Mays assembly against Mays than the
[SPEAKER_00]: Trypsium assembly against Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, our assemblies show good
contiguity and collinearity.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the reference genomes, we can produce
them quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shows that de novo nanopore
assembly is tractable for large repetitive
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, whole genome alignment remains
problematic and we're still looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies to benchmark our assemblies and
assess their completeness and accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're also looking for higher depth
Illumina for our assemblies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will help us to polish more
accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Trypsium, we only have about 3X,
which is less than the minimum needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: polish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at some point, I need to get
around to actually mapping freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting evolutionary question
would be how genome fractionation has
[SPEAKER_00]: proceeded in Trypsium versus Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just in summation, I'd like to
thank everyone in the Buckler lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got all the names up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big lab right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christy Galtzo was the one who originated
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now at Inari.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd like to thank my committee who
didn't make it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Elad Oren, Baosheng
Song, Sinta, and Nick Lepak especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, if it's difficult to
cross Mays in Trypsium, how do we propose
[SPEAKER_00]: moving any traits that we identify into
Mays?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer would be genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can identify specific alleles,
then we can...
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the plan is to attempt to edit them,
both in a freezing susceptible background
[SPEAKER_00]: and induce freezing tolerance,
and then eventually into Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have mentioned this,
and I might have missed it, but why did
[SPEAKER_00]: you decide to assemble Floridonum instead
of Dactyloides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just because it probably has that
geographical bottleneck?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, why did we pick
Trypsium Floridonum to assemble and not
[SPEAKER_00]: Dactyloides?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is we actually picked both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason this particular species and one
particular line from the species came up
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's the majority... It's apparent
in, I think, 25 to 30% of the F1s we have
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field, so its alleles are
over-represented in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have further plans to sequence
Dactyloides and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
