[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really fortunate, Kyle and I and
our students are fortunate to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to get a second look at the flow of
behavior of the stinky two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a chance to study around the clock
for two and a half days its production of
[SPEAKER_01]: the stinky volatiles that give it its name
and for which it's justly known.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during that time there was a blog on
the Cornell site and people from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world wrote in and asked, what are
those strings?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those wires?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you people doing to our flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we responded that we were actually
collecting data from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought we'd take a few minutes to
talk about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we stinky starts, when the space
begins to open and the show goes on,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have a fishing line
dangling from the gurus above the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: support this little battery operated
vacuum pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nine volt battery at height pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will allow us to collect volatiles
from the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really interesting about this is
that usually we enclose a flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're always smaller than this,
in what we call a head space bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: an oven bag, say that you can bake turkey
in that doesn't have volatiles of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let the volatiles accumulate and then
we collect them over a little trap like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette filter, but much smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have here is the battery
pump that we're going to put a little
[SPEAKER_01]: filter on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hang it suspended into the floral
chamber where a lot of the volatiles are
[SPEAKER_01]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to take snapshots every
two hours of how the odors change as the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, as the, as the, as the
inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is cumulative.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pump is just going to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to collect volatiles over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This little syringe here, we call it a
solid phase micro extraction fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a little piece of essentially
fishing line that also gets exposed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: chamber of the inflorescence and absorbs
the volatiles onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can use chemical analysis to just
strip those volatiles off and separate
[SPEAKER_01]: them into their component peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be posting those data on the
Cornell site for everybody to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what we're going to do, as we're
taking these chemical measurements,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're also going to be taking measurements
of temperature and carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've noticed from previous research
and also two years ago when this was last,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are rhythmic thermal blasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also want to measure possible
carbon dioxide blasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here is a digital
temperature probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'll be doing is sticking it
into the tissue at various heights of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spades to test the temperature over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have syringes that will be taking
air samples from inside the chamber to
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate their CO2 concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our suit to analyze behind us
and we'll be injecting samples into that
[SPEAKER_00]: to test that concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what reason for being interested in
that we know from the thermal imagery that
[SPEAKER_01]: these things really heat up just as
they're producing the largest release of
[SPEAKER_01]: volatiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the insects that are attracted to
these flowers experience all of that at
[SPEAKER_01]: once.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat inside the chamber, the carbon
dioxide as the plant is respiring like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinter, and these very strong
information-rich volatiles that flies and
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles that are attracted to this plant
have a lot of meaning because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: simulating the cues emanating from a
rotting corpse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be doing that around the clock as
the flower opens and as people come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to surreptitiously sneak into
the corner and collect our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be posting these data as we
collect them.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
