[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much to Don and for everybody
here and also in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that turnout in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much for coming out all
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to reiterate something that
Don said, that this is a truly fabulous
[SPEAKER_00]: award.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think anybody who has any interest
in doing travel after they graduate or can
[SPEAKER_00]: think of a project that involves travel as
part of your graduate education,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really fantastic
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was personally very excited to get
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also really excited to talk to you
today about my experience in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start by introducing my
research a little bit to give you a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a context about why I even went to
Tasmania to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move into an introduction to Tasmania,
kind of give you a whirlwind tour through
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of the state, and then talk about
the research that I did in Tassie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully at the end,
I'll have time for some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pictures that are accompanying the
slides aren't always completely topical
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard when you have so many
pictures and you want to show off the
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty of a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enjoy the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also try to look at the data that's on
the slides if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start off by talking about
sauerot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the disease that I work on as
part of my PhD project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I arrived at Cornell in 2013,
sauerot was a very poorly understood
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really understand what caused
it, how it spread, where it even was in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did know that it typically
developed on tight clustered thin skin
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to see a discoloration starting
at about 15 bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really the characteristic of the
disease is that we smell vinegar really
[SPEAKER_00]: emanating from these clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wounds appear to exacerbate the rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start to see damaged berries
ooze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see drosophila or fruit flies
swarming around the clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, we've seen it in New York,
Ontario, Oregon, Washington, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also reports of it in France and
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, this is a picture of
sauerot on Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spoiler alert, this is from Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns out I did find it there,
which was very good for my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a particularly disgusting picture
of sauerot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave it alone and let it do its
thing, and I'm sorry for the
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulturists in the room, the
pathologists, we just love this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a truly disgusting example of
sauerot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the questions that I've asked
as part of my PhD research are what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the identities of the microorganisms that
cause sauerot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the epidemiology of the disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the role of vinegar flies or fruit
flies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, is sauerot found in other
cool climate viticultural regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what brings me to Tasmania?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is Tasmania?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was asked a lot of times if I was
going to Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, in fact, I did not go to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Tasmania is this nice little state
down here at the bottom of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very much unlike the rest of
Australia in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of form a picture of what you
think of of Australia in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll venture into some pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a very different place than the
images we have in our mind of kangaroos
[SPEAKER_00]: bouncing through airs rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Uluru in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a very different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is the state of Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down at the bottom, we have Hobart,
which is the capital, which is where I was
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other major city in the state is
Launceston, which is up in the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to kind of give you,
this is your whirlwind photo tour of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go in this
counterclockwise fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get to see some beautiful shots
of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully kind of give you a taste for
what Tasmania looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of give you this feeling for
the place that I tried to get over my five
[SPEAKER_00]: months there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting out just east of Hobart here,
Dolorite is the type of rock that forms
[SPEAKER_00]: these amazing formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually a type of igneous rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was magma that rose out of the center
of the Earth when Tasmania was separating
[SPEAKER_00]: from Gondwana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a really amazing kind of
event, obviously, in the history of our
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Tasmania was one of the last
pieces to break off, right before
[SPEAKER_00]: Antarctica broke off of Gondwana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it did, these massive formations
literally came out of the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth and formed these rock formations on
the coastline that are like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else I've ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just truly phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just covering these coastlines,
you can see them in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also hike out on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasmania is a state that, I mean,
it's an island, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So water dominates everything around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just this vastness of very few people
actually living there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only half a million people on the
entire island and this really vast space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And completely gorgeous beaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from the white sand beaches
that it's primarily quartz that has made
[SPEAKER_00]: these white sands and gorgeous waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it is unlike a lot of the rest of
Australia, where this is cool climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was there in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a drought year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it does get cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I left, at the end of May,
it was down to 33, 34 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really what you would think of
normally when you think of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the northeastern coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of moving up towards Launceston
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the type of unbelievable land
formations that you see when you go out
[SPEAKER_00]: hiking mountains and on also these white
sand beaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first of a few ismises
that I'm going to show you photos of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the kind of bay on your right is
called Wineglass Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a really picturesque setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with these unbelievable rock
formations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this, a lot of the landscape
of Tasmania was formed through a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: periods of glaciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountains being formed and then being
covered by water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the water receding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just a really carved out and
diverse geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we move into the center of the
state, it starts to look extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this low-lying brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this portion of the state,
which is at really high altitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very harsh climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at cold, damp,
very swampy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is in the middle of the
state where we're not near the ocean at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lots of standing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just very interesting rock formations
and low-lying brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the types of,
I have to include these types of views
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really just gives a view of what
Tasmania has to offer in terms of just
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being from Oregon originally,
I'm into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gorgeous and wonderful hiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wombats, which I know I can't show
pictures of Australia without showing
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures of its creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so wombats are hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're often in these sort of low
plain areas, digging holes and being
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are not deterred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about people at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just dig their holes and eat all day
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cradle Mountain, which is a
beautiful spot in the center of Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just unbelievable peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this really interesting
vegetation where you almost see palm-like
[SPEAKER_00]: trees in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move kind of into the southwest
part of the state, this is all World
[SPEAKER_00]: Heritage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really, this is all park land.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no one who lives in this part of
the state at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all really pretty amazing hiking
trails, backpacking trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this part is a dammed area,
which has formed this lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is literally where the roads end
in the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't drive any further than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to continue down into the
southwest part of the state, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a seven to 10 day backpacking
trip down to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this little guy in the front is a
spotted coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's quite adorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q-U-O-L-L.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tiny marsupial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we head back towards Hobart,
we start to see just a really stark change
[SPEAKER_00]: in vegetation, almost jungle-like,
with palm trees and huge ferns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, dolomite caves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not dolarite, but dolomite caves are
pretty prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also home to platypus, which I never
saw, so I still have no proof that they
[SPEAKER_00]: really exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then back to the Isthmus on Bruny
Island, which is only about an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Hobart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where Captain Cook originally
arrived when he came to this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just spectacular views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to reiterate, Tasmania is cold
for a lot of parts of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is me backpacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do indeed have a lot of clothes on
because it was rainy and chilly and so
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the view from top of Mount
Wellington, which is in Hobart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking over Hobart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the haziness that you see here is from
the controlled burns of the eucalyptus
[SPEAKER_00]: that the firefighters were in charge of
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the seeds of the
eucalyptus require fire in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but by the time the winter was
approaching, these controlled burns were
[SPEAKER_00]: going almost all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back in Hobart now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Mount Wellington, and again,
with the dolorite pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a little less red there,
or is that just the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I think it might just be the
light, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a redness in those rocks that
is pretty phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the wallbees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't not show a wallaby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, think about deer and how
deer are everywhere in Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wallabies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the smaller cousins, the paddymillons,
those are everywhere as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on campus at the University of
Tasmania, hopping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is Hobart from Mount
Wellington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to look down in this part,
this is where the University of Tasmania
[SPEAKER_00]: campus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too shabby looking over the ocean
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hobart itself has a really rich,
but also very conflicting past.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a complete wipeout of the
aboriginal population when the Europeans
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a quite devastating history to
learn about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, all of Tasmania was a penal
colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the island itself was the prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot, and I would say most of the
older buildings, were convict built,
[SPEAKER_00]: including my little house that I lived in
down there in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was built by convicts in the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just the history is everywhere,
very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, from an agricultural standpoint,
there is a rich history of apple growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of southern Tasmania has apple
orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a lot of quince and apples,
and a lot of interesting history involving
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently, a move into
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was based at the University of
Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked primarily with Kathy Evans,
who was based at the Hobart campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also worked with Fiona Kerslake,
who was a junior research fellow up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Launceston, in the northern part of the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of split my time between the
two of them, but was primarily based in
Launceston.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my lab was in Hobart at the
UTAS campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked a lot with Kathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major viticultural areas in
Tasmania, I've highlighted them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the three that I worked in primarily
were the Cold River Valley, the Derwent
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley, and the Tamar Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Tamar Valley, you can see up near
Launceston, the Cold River Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Derwent Valley down near Hobart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I primarily split my
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Cold River Valley, I worked
with two commercial vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Derwent Valley with one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Tamar Valley, two other
commercial vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all organized by Fiona and
Kathy, which I was just so grateful that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to do some groundwork for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of northern Tasmania,
while I was there, there was a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: brush fires that started right a couple of
weeks after I arrived, and persisted for a
[SPEAKER_00]: big week.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big portion of the time that I was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see on the left-hand side,
that's my view from one of the vineyards
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the burning happening and
the big plumes of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orange skies at night in
Launceston were from the brush fires as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And though there was a lot of conversation
about smoke taint and how it would impact
[SPEAKER_00]: wine quality, there was a lot of research
going on at that time by Fiona,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, about how the brush fires were
going to impact the wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard from her lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had heard that people were feeling
pretty hopeful about it, that there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of damage to the grapes in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Hobart area in Cold River
Valley was going through, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole state was going through a
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cold River Valley was visibly drier
than whenever I was up in the Tamar
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tamar Valley, a lot more humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a lot muggier, whereas a lot
drier down in the Cold River.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a viticultural standpoint,
I mean, viticulture in Tasmania looked
[SPEAKER_00]: very familiar to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a lot of differences in terms
of training systems or trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked very, very similar to what I was
used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of VSP trained vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just very familiar viticultural
techniques, because a lot of them has been
[SPEAKER_00]: brought over by the Europeans originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of my three research
components, I'm going to start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about just these three, the Illumina
sequencing component, looking at sour rock
[SPEAKER_00]: causal organisms, and then also the
environmental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question that kind of guided the
Illumina sequencing component was,
[SPEAKER_00]: what epiphytic microbes are present on the
grape surface?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three years of data on this
topic from the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to also expand this to
Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal here is to understand the
presence and changes in yeast and bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I did this, and one of the reasons
that I needed to arrive so early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season in Tasmania, was because I
worked in five commercial vineyards and
[SPEAKER_00]: did DNA extractions on grapes starting at
pea-sized berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very early on in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then took samples at pea-sized bunch
closure, brazen, 15 bricks, and at
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then used Amplicon sequencing with ITS
and 16S primers to amplify fungal and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a huge project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, because of it being a
big project, I do not have data to show
[SPEAKER_00]: you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is going into a very large paper
that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited that the research from the
Drere is going to go into a paper that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be out next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I see Lance over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fingers crossed that it'll be out next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question that I wanted to answer
is, is sour rot found in Tasmania?
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, I already answered or
spoiled it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it is, in fact, found in
Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an echidna, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was hanging out in the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of sour rot incidence and
severity, I took incidence and severity
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings every five days until harvest at a
commercial vineyard in Hobart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just a vineyard, actually,
that my husband was working at at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, hey, we have sour rot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fortunately, I have trained him
very well to recognize sour rot symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every five days, I took disease and
incidence ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are some of the examples of the
fruit that I found from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at those incidence and
severity ratings, we see an exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the amount of disease in this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this is that there is so
little education on these sorts of disease
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there are very few tools
available to growers for sour rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: partially because there aren't any real
labeled products for it, especially not in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of insecticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing to target the
Drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the disease starts, it progresses
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really see this is a huge amount of
disease, to the point where the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: really was dropping the fruit on the
ground underneath of the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the education was telling him,
don't drop the fruit under the vines,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if the disease is being spread by
Drosophila, the Drosophila are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue breeding in your grapes and then
go up into the canopy and spread it more,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is exactly what it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was an educational process for
me as well to know that these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: types of measures that needed to be
communicated as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove that fruit from the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let it sit underneath those vines
and continue spreading the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Tasmanian devil, just in case
you guys were wondering about whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk about them for two seconds
and then get back to science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do suffer from a facial tumor that
has been devastating their population in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are several breeding programs
which have been very successful at
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroducing resistant devils back into
the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been doing really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had huge success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I saw one while backpacking
out on an island.
[SPEAKER_00]: One wandered up to the campsite and was a
little too friendly for my liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so they are there and they're
very cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question we really wanted to know
about saurot was, are there the same
[SPEAKER_00]: causal organisms for saurot in Tasmania as
there are here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what we know about that is
that we require yeast and bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit flies in order to cause saurot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was that the same answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are those the same causes as in
Tasmania?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did was I took a wash of
three berries on each of 10 clusters from
[SPEAKER_00]: six vineyards, plated them out,
and then sent two reps of each for
[SPEAKER_00]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found was very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, these are very consistent with
what we see in the US and in the finger
[SPEAKER_00]: legs, is that yeast is present in very
high quantities, as well as acetic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, which is what we had been
crossing our fingers for, but also we
[SPEAKER_00]: found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very, very happy to see that
the yeast and bacteria were present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that these are the same species that
we see here in the finger legs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no big surprises, but also very
exciting to see for the first time that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can tie the saurot in Tasmania to saurot
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of environmental factors,
we were looking at whether we could put
[SPEAKER_00]: some hobo data loggers out into the field
and take measurements every 10 minutes for
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 days, and track temperature,
dew point, relative humidity, a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of environmental factors,
and see if we could correlate them with
[SPEAKER_00]: saurot symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found at that same vineyard
outside of Hobart, where I had the very
[SPEAKER_00]: high levels of incidence and severity of
saurot, is that I was able to correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum daily dew point very well with my
severity rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which just meant that it gave me a jumping
off point to when I returned to the finger
[SPEAKER_00]: legs that we could further study
temperature and relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe there was a correlation there
that we wanted to look further at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, in another vineyard where
I suspected there would be saurot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there didn't end up being any,
we saw that opposite trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a downward trend of maximum
daily dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was sort of just a jumping off
point for us to delve deeper into the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions that would be
causing susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last component, just that I think
is very important, and I kind of touched
[SPEAKER_00]: on a little bit, was I worked a lot with
growers when I was down there to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: both the growers and the crews about how
to identify saurot and how to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of backpackers down there
who work in vineyards to support their
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling, and a lot of them have never
worked in agriculture, let alone
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're seeing grapes for the first
time, they're harvesting grapes for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time, and so there's a ton of
education to do, and also the crew changes
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a brand new group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so talking to the vineyard managers
about saurot and how to educate their
[SPEAKER_00]: crews on it was a really big factor in
what I was there to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a really educational
process, I think, for a very great
[SPEAKER_00]: educational experience for both me and for
them, just to understand what they had
[SPEAKER_00]: available to them and what sort of
viticulture techniques they could use when
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have the spray management
techniques available to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank, there's so many people
to thank, but the Frederick D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reward itself, as I mentioned before,
just such a fantastic opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I encourage other graduate students to
apply for it, as well as the award
[SPEAKER_00]: committee members, Anita Busseck,
Marvin Pritz, and Josh Serra, my
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators at University of Tasmania,
as well as Tasmanian grape growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ones I listed here were the
vineyard managers primarily at these
[SPEAKER_00]: various wineries and vineyards that I
worked with, and of course my PI,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wayne Wilcox, for allowing me to spend six
months to go to Tasmania, and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: I really brought back a lot of very
valuable data that we're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to put right into paper, so it looks good
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I will take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question was, are there any
viticultural techniques that the farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: are using that are effective against sour
rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was tricky, because I think part
of the problem was when I went down there
[SPEAKER_00]: originally, I didn't even know if we were
going to see sour rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a big question mark up until the
point where I actually saw sour rot in
[SPEAKER_00]: those vineyards, and so I was kind of
observing their practices and seeing if I
[SPEAKER_00]: could point out anything to them,
but I think what we continually talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: is how to loosen clusters, and so leaf
pulling techniques and any measures that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do from a viticulture standpoint
to reduce the compactness of clusters,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's really what does it,
is when those berries are pushing up
[SPEAKER_00]: against each other and they're forming
wounds, it's an entry point for yeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and for fruit flies to lay eggs,
and so kind of reducing that cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction was a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily leaf pulling in the early
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's been the most effective
technique, but you have to be really on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be very vigilant, and you have
to be pretty dedicated to it, because leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling requires a crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can do it with a machine,
but a lot of people don't have mechanized
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf pullers to just put onto their
tractors, so it's very expensive either
[SPEAKER_00]: way, but it is a technique that people
have used in the past, and it's well
[SPEAKER_00]: researched, and there's a lot of
literature about it, but that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest thing that I could recommend to
people, because there weren't,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was all for next year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this made it even harder, because I'm
standing there going, well, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing really that you can do now except
for remove this fruit from your vineyards,
[SPEAKER_00]: but next year, think about leaf pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about really reducing that cluster
compaction to the best of your abilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was about thick skin
versus thin skin varieties and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulturists are switching to thicker
skin varieties to avoid the disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and no, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is that thin skin varieties
are primarily grown in cool climate
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture areas because of the ripening
issue that you need to get the fruit ripe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and thicker skin varieties, they take
longer to ripen, and so it's kind of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a tight spot where you can't
switch so much to the thicker skin
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, because they're going to be
more difficult to ripen, so no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not really seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people are, at least here in
the Finger Lakes, Pinot noir is a
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult grape to grow, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult, and it has trouble
ripening here, and then on top of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very susceptible to sour rot,
so in talking to several growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area, I know that some people are just,
they've had it with Pinot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things where they're not
going to go through the trouble of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it anymore to then have it get sour rot a
week before harvest and then not even be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's conversations going on,
but at a very small kind of micro level at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, switching, and then also from a
viticultural standpoint, re-grafting your
[SPEAKER_00]: vines is a huge, costly undertaking,
and so most people don't have that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more just managing the vines that you
already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question was whether I have
guesses as to the sequence of events of
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast bacteria drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, as I drop my microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we do have guesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have found yeast on the surface of
the grapes from a very early point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, and I think that's, it's a
generally accepted idea in the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that there is yeast that is
coming in on the surface of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is where is the acetic acid
coming from that's forming the vinegar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, the alumina is, that's kind
of the role there is trying to address
[SPEAKER_00]: where this bacteria is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that fruit flies themselves,
they eat yeast, they eat acetic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, so it's on their bodies,
so they are, they could be vectoring it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be the instigators,
but it could also just be on the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grapes itself, and there could be
something to do with the flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: something to do with an enzyme that could
be speeding up the process, or as they
[SPEAKER_00]: liquefy the pulp of the grapes,
perhaps that's helping to speed along the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, that is sort of the,
that is the big question that still has
[SPEAKER_00]: left, we have to address before I can be
done with my PhD, is sort of what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence, because that's everybody's
question, and it's my question too,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hope to know sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question was whether the sort
of epiphytic microorganisms change from
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard to vineyard in different regions,
and so that's the role, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the alumina sequencing, the aim of
that, that's basically, that's the aim of
[SPEAKER_00]: that side of the project, is to understand
whether it changes not only over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the season, but from site to
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole idea of terroir in
winemaking is that every single site,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what affects the wine quality and
the wines that are produced out of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so one would think that that would,
you know, be affected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms that were specific to that
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we see a lot of the same yeasts at
every site, you know, there's like a top
[SPEAKER_00]: five yeasts that we see everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions are whether they change in
quantity and how those are affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: different environmental conditions and
over the course of the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm really hoping that that paper is
going to address some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so the question is whether there's an
epicenter for where sour rod originated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and no, I don't think, because it's not,
I'm not dealing with a traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen, I don't work with, you know,
one, a causal organism that is
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally considered a plant pathogen,
we're dealing with yeast and bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are just in the environment,
so I think instead of there being an
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenter of the disease, it's more like
the environmental conditions that give
[SPEAKER_00]: rise to the disease, so it's more of a
question of water, you know, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: cool climate viticulture with thin skin
varieties and where there might be more
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, or higher humidity, and rains
near harvest, that's where you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see more sour rod, because those are the
conditions that give rise, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly, that are conducive to sour rod,
as opposed to there being an origin of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was about whether,
was, you know, before I went, the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't on a lot of people's radars,
and so now that I'm not there anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: what things are in place to help growers
kind of manage the disease or talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a lot, there is no extension
system like we have here, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the researchers work with growers,
but there's no formal system where they
[SPEAKER_00]: have an appointment to go and,
you know, they have to spend X amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time out there talking to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an active grower community,
they are interested in, they're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in learning, and they talk to each other a
lot amongst each other, but there isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, no formal structure available to
them to meet up and have these
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of growers that I worked
with just said, well, we've never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: this before, it'll probably never happen
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going like, oh gosh, well,
I really hope I didn't personally cause
[SPEAKER_00]: sour rod for the only year that I happened
to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm hoping that it'll just be,
I think it'll just be something that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens naturally over time, that the
growers are going to have to have those
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations because the problem isn't
gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can guarantee it wasn't a fluke,
and I think it's just gonna have to happen
[SPEAKER_00]: between themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there aren't any tools for
them to use in terms of insecticide spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is gonna be the most effective tool
that they can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are gonna have to get creative,
but no, there's not a formal structure for
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing that to happen, which is really,
it's really unfortunate, yeah.
