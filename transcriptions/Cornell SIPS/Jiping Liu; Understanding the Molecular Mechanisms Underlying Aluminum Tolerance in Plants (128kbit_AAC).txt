[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Bill, and thank you,
Leah, for the instruction, and also
[SPEAKER_02]: thanking everybody for coming to my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the title of my talk,
Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms
[SPEAKER_02]: Underlying Aluminum Resistance in Plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my topic is about aluminum toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aluminum toxicity is tightly associated
with acid soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that aluminum is the most
abundant metal on the earth's crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under neutral pH, aluminum is tightly
bound to the soil clays, which is not
[SPEAKER_02]: toxic to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, under acidic soil conditions,
the toxic aluminum species, so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: Al3+, will release from the soil clays
into soil solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is highly toxic to plant root
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here shows the map of wood acid soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the acid soil, which is in
red color, is widely distributed around
[SPEAKER_02]: the world with a significant fraction in
the developing countries in the tropics
[SPEAKER_02]: and subtropics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is really a need to understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying,
[SPEAKER_02]: or mechanisms underlying aluminum
resistance in crops in order to further
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance resistance to acid soil for a
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this slide shows the toxic effects of
aluminum on two wheat lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is ETA, that's aluminum tolerant,
and ESA is aluminum sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, under neutral pH,
there's no difference in root growth
[SPEAKER_02]: between these two lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, under acid soil conditions,
you can see the sensitive line,
[SPEAKER_02]: the root growth was completely inhibited
with stunted and damaged root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem of aluminum toxicity is so
prevalent in developing countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is the major limitation for crop
production on acid soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also from this slide, you can see the
genetic variation in terms of aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the focus for our study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also the basis for plant
breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in today's talk, I will first briefly
introduce the strategies adopted by plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to cope with aluminum stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will highlight some efforts in
my group to unveil how plants use these
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies to achieve aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so here's the diagram of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the root and the above ground
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this part is a magnification of the
root, especially the root tail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So root tip is the target for aluminum
toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's most sensitive to aluminum stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the rhizosphere, and here's a
diagram for the root epidermal cells with
[SPEAKER_02]: a plasma membrane, the membrane of
vacuole, and a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the widely and most documented
magnifications for aluminum resistance is
[SPEAKER_02]: the exclusion or avoidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoidance, magnifications, which prevents
aluminum from getting into the root cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is done by the release of the root
cells of organic acids, such as malate,
[SPEAKER_02]: citrase, into the rhizosphere where the
organic acid can form non-toxic aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: complex that cannot be get into the cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like exclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second mechanism is to deal with the
aluminum that enters into the root cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this aluminum can be either sequestered
into the vacuole or can be translocated
[SPEAKER_02]: from the root to the shoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the shoot is less sensitive to aluminum
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recently, increasing lines of evidence
indicate that modification of a cell wall
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and function could be a critical
step for aluminum resistance in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also focus on that in my later talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the second part of my talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will highlight some efforts in my
group for the aluminum exclusion
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanisms in sorghum and true aluminum
resistance in erbidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I will report on some of our
progress in understanding the regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: or signaling pathway involving resistance
to low pH and aluminum stress in
[SPEAKER_02]: erbidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the first part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this shows the root growth of two
sorghum lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is torrent SC283 and the sensitive
BR007 on the low pH plus aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the root growth of the
torrent lines has no effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see stunted and damaged root
for the sensitive line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the work done by Jura McGahey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a former PhD student for Leon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now he's a close collaborator for our
group also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also he found that the very close
correlation between the aluminum activated
[SPEAKER_02]: citrate release from the torrent line and
aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no organic acid released from
the sensitive line versus the torrent
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this line is very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the summary for the relationship
between aluminum torrents and root
[SPEAKER_02]: citrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here shows the torrent line growth with
or without aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the control and the treatment
in a period of six days aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the first day, the root
growth of, even for the root growth of the
[SPEAKER_02]: torrent line, so it was inhibited by about
50% compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it continued being inhibited.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the third day of treatment,
you can see gradually increase of root
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the fourth day, you see there's no
difference between the treatment and the
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this process is very closely and
positively correlated with the root
[SPEAKER_02]: citrate release in the torrent line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see without aluminum, you don't see
any citrate release.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with aluminum, you can see gradually
induction of citrate release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the third day, there's much more
citrate release and then this
[SPEAKER_02]: corresponding to the increase of root
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time of the sixth day,
the huge amount of citrate release from
[SPEAKER_02]: the root tip and you can see fully
recovery of the root growth in the torrent
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: In contrast, in the sensitive line,
you never seen any citrate release from
[SPEAKER_02]: the root with or without aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually the root growth never recover
from the treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on that, Jura, he did a QDM
mapping project and he actually mapped the
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum resistant locus into one single
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I come into Leon's lab and Jura
graduate and so we further collaborate on
[SPEAKER_02]: that project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also by the way, I mean, he also did
the correlation analysis for citrate
[SPEAKER_02]: release and aluminum torrents for a small
panel of sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's 10 a section.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he found is the citrate release is
positively correlated with aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: torrents among this section.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, so we finally clone the gene,
the resistant gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It encodes a sorghum, a member of sorghum
motor drug and toxic compound extrusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gene, so we demonstrate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this as been made gene actually encode
the aluminum activated citrate transporter
[SPEAKER_02]: in sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the expression as been made is
positively correlated with aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: torrents as well as citrate release in the
same sorghum a session panel I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: in the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is the trade-off for using citrate
as a weapon for aluminum resistance?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very obvious that that's a carbon
cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for plants, best benefit is to use
minimum amount of citrate to achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum aluminum torrents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's deal with the carbon use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can sorghum achieve this?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one way is to special find the
expression of as be made gene expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see as be made is only is made
express in the root tip region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the region most sensitive to
aluminum and that's the one that need most
[SPEAKER_02]: protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, I mean, if you,
we also do the immunolocalization and LCM,
[SPEAKER_02]: the laser dissection microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real-time PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually the as be made protein and
transcripts is only expressed in the very
[SPEAKER_02]: defined region like epidermal cells and
the first layer of cortex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's define the citrate release only
in that part of the plant root tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that the acid soil is in
reality is not a homogeneous property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it's quite heterogeneous in
distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here shows an acid soil field in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the red color indicate that the soil is
highly acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see it not far away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's some soil region that's
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either neutral or even alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's in the XY dimension.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the third dimension,
the vertical dimension, so you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: also very lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, I mean, the top soils are less
aluminum toxicity than the deep soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also when the plants grow from the top
soil into the deep soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plant roots grows as a tip growth
manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever he goes, it's like constantly
meet the change of soil environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, how do plant roots
sense the frequent changes in aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity and how it react?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question we want to address.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer this question in Sorghum,
I actually transformed the sp-made gene
[SPEAKER_02]: into yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeast has no homolog of sp-made gene in
its genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without aluminum, you see no,
with or without aluminum, you see no
[SPEAKER_02]: citrate release, which is mediated by the
sp-made.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the sp-made expression,
yeast, you can see the constitutive
[SPEAKER_02]: release of citrate with or without
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very different from what we
have seen in Sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the citrate release is actually
activated, only activated by aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no release under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this suggests there must have some
negative regulator for sp-made in plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's lead to my second work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, and then I decided to use the
split ubiquitin yeast 2-hybrid systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because I use that, because sp-made is
a membrane protein, so I have to use this
[SPEAKER_02]: split ubiquitin yeast 2-hybrid systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: To screen a library that made from the
Sorghum root tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found a very strong candidate
interacting protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a putative metal-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we call it as an MVP, as a strong
candidate for the sp-made interacting
[SPEAKER_02]: component.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens if we co-transform these
two components?
[SPEAKER_02]: This component into yeast, actually we see
the reconstitution of aluminum-activated
[SPEAKER_02]: citrate release as we've seen in Sorghum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is the single sp-made transformed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see constitutively large amount of
citrate release versus the very controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: and aluminum-activated citrate release in
the double transformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, the citrate is the
organic acid that binds to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a foundation for
aluminum-resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the aluminum tolerance of these
two lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: With this one, has higher amount of
citrate release, can achieve higher degree
[SPEAKER_02]: of aluminum-resistant or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is the next experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: For testing relative growth or aluminum
tolerance for three different yeast lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the yeast just transformed with
amputee vector?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see that's very sensitive to
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the single transform, the growth
geometry increase, is not as good as the
[SPEAKER_02]: double transform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we remember, I mean, this line has huge
amount of citrate release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought, oh, it could reach a higher
degree of aluminum-resistant, but actually
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that the carbon cost is too
much and then actually inhibit cell
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the working model for how
these two components work together to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve aluminum-activated citrate
isolation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is the plasma membrane of the root
epidermal cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And SbMate is a citrate transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And NbP is a negative regulator for
SbMate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without aluminum, it tightly binds to
the permeation pathway of the citrate
[SPEAKER_02]: transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which can block the citrate release
from the cytosol into the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And NbP is an aluminum-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under acidic soil condition, NbP binds to
aluminum and changes its conformation and
[SPEAKER_02]: also its affinity to SbMate will be
decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will lead to dissociation or
partial dissociation of NbP from the
[SPEAKER_02]: SbMate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leading to opening of the citrate
exudation permeation pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leading to the exudation of citrate
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so next would be to adjust this
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to confirm three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is NbP is an aluminum-binding protein
and also the binding to aluminum can
[SPEAKER_02]: disrupt the NbP and SbMate interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the work by Michael Lee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think he's also in the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here's the pull-down assay to
demonstrate that NbP is a pH-dependent
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is just the beads.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see there's no binding of aluminum to
binding of the NbP to the beads.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means any binding here is
specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also under the treatment, we only see
the binding of NbP to the aluminum beads
[SPEAKER_02]: at a low pH, but not in the neutral pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's confirmed that NbP is a
pH-dependent aluminum-binding protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And second, we need to demonstrate that
aluminum-binding to NbP can disrupt NbP
[SPEAKER_02]: and SbMate interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the in vitro pull-down assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see under the neutral pH,
so with the in presence or in absence of
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum, so there's always strong
interaction between SbMate and SbMbP here.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, under low pH, without aluminum,
we can see a little bit decrease of
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction of these two components.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when aluminum was added, you see
there's no interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that's completely dissociated
within these two components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's in vivo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did the in vivo BIFC
interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a system that tested for
interaction of two proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's protein-protein interaction,
you will see fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the interaction was disrupted,
you will see decrease of the fluorescent
[SPEAKER_02]: signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the BIFC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this movie shows what happened
after aluminum was added.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the tobacco epidermal leaf
cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's quite rapid process.
[SPEAKER_02]: About two and a half hours, you see almost
completely disappearance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorescent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay, what's the control?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a control that just eject the
buffer, but without aluminum, and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same period time of recovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: see the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that demonstrate that the interaction
of aluminum, I mean, SbMate and Bp was
[SPEAKER_02]: disrupted by adding aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in previous slide, we demonstrate that
MbP is a aluminum binding protein,
[SPEAKER_02]: and binding of aluminum could cause
dissociation of MbP and SbMate
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much demonstrate, confirm our
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here comes the second part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's dealing with the two torrents in
adipose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So deal with the remove aluminum from cell
wall into cytosol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cell wall is a very important organelle
in aluminum torrents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's estimated that 90% of the aluminum
in roots was accumulated in cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So increasing number of, increasing blinds
of evidence indicate that modification of
[SPEAKER_02]: cell wall components could be a very
important, plays a very important role in
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two torrents, magnetisms,
involved like two parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is move aluminum into the cytosol
followed by sequester, sequestration into
[SPEAKER_02]: the vacuole or translocated into the above
ground tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in fact, in plants, there's a specific
class of, that actually they like
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the so-called aluminum
accumulated plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So including like tea, buckwheat,
and hydrangea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they tend to uptake large amount of
aluminum from the soil and translocated
[SPEAKER_02]: into the shoot tissue and store the
aluminum in the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this photo shows hydrangea plants in
front of vagaments in the early spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that some of them produce
blue flowers with some of them red
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can tell you they all have the same
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means the flower color change is
due to environment, environmental effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not genetic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it's on the assisted of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the one on the left that's grew in the
acid soil, so that produce the blue flower
[SPEAKER_02]: was the neutral pH soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the produce red flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a close up for the, very
beautiful I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually the only difference,
there's a group in Japan, they are
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture, they actually analyze what's
going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found that actually the only
difference for these two flowers is that
[SPEAKER_02]: this one, the blue one, they accumulate
high amount of aluminum in the sepals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean what we see actually is the sepal
is not pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the red color flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually they, the reason is that
under neutral pH, so this the anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulated in the vacuole, so called,
they are finding 3O glucoside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has a native red color.
[SPEAKER_02]: But under acidic soil condition,
aluminum would be accumulated into the
[SPEAKER_02]: vacuole, which combines to the anthocyanin
and turn its color into blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the secret of that magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually they cloned these two
transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is responsible for the moving of
aluminum into the cytosol, so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Localized, they called POT or plasma
membrane localized aluminum transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the one responsible for vacuole
transporter is called VOT or vacuole
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both these genes are belong to the
acryporyne gene family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So acryporyne, it's a very large gene
family in plants, so like they have 35
[SPEAKER_02]: members in apidopsis and 33 in rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also acryporyne tend to transport
neutral soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, and also I mean POT and VOT are
the first members of acryporyne
[SPEAKER_02]: demonstrate that be able to transport
aluminum, so that's quite interesting for
[SPEAKER_02]: us working on aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question, although they demonstrate
that these genes function in aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: transporter, but we don't know if they
have any function in aluminum torrents in
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the POT is the plasma membrane
localized aluminum transporter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and which could be a critical component
for aluminum uptake in roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to focus to study the POT
homolog in apidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And HM POT is closely related to the NIP
subfamily in apidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: NIP stands for denoduling 26 in chinsic
protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this work was led by Yiqi Wang.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we screened the library for the
nine member of the NIPs in apidopsis and
[SPEAKER_02]: found out that NIP 1-2 actually has the
hypersensitivity of positive phenotype to
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum stress when expressed in yeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the control and the treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we included NRED-1, so it's a
famous aluminum transporter localized in
[SPEAKER_02]: the root cell plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this work has been done by Jian Yu,
and we can see hypersensitive of NIP 1-2
[SPEAKER_02]: to aluminum, but the sensitivity is not as
strong as the NRED-1 indicated that
[SPEAKER_02]: probably, I mean, the NIP 1-2,
the capacity is lower than NRED-1 in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of aluminum transport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also Yiqi Wang has the aluminum
accumulation in the three yeast lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see the hyperaccumulation of
aluminum in the NIP 1-2 expression yeast
[SPEAKER_02]: line, but the amount is not as high as the
NRED-1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further indicating that the capacity of
NIP 1-2 transporter, aluminum transporter,
[SPEAKER_02]: might be lower than NRED-1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Yiqi has the subcellular
localization of NIP 1-2.
[SPEAKER_02]: He made the GFP fusion protein,
and this slide shows the localization of
[SPEAKER_02]: the fusion protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's in the plasma membrane,
and this further demonstrate by the dipy
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very clear localized on the plasma
membrane for this protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And NIP 1-2 is made express on the root,
but not ensued.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the RT-PCR, and also this is the
real-time PCR, and see the induction of
[SPEAKER_02]: NIP 1-2 expression by aluminum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after four hours of aluminum treatment,
so it reached the maximum level and
[SPEAKER_02]: decreased a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, NIP 1-2 expression is
specifically induced by aluminum
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment, not by other metal stress,
as well as by the low pH treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the tissue specific localization
of NIP 1-2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the gas analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see NIP 1-2 is made express in
the root tape region.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the primary and lateral root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so also the, you see the gas stainless
was enhanced by aluminum treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the, not only enhanced also
by the region, I mean, going up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the phenotype for the NIP 1-2
mutant in terms of aluminum tolerance?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here shows that the NIP 1-2,
so we acquire three independent tDNA
[SPEAKER_02]: insertion line from ADRC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can see all of them are hypersensitive
to aluminum treatment compared to the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the wild type, and a significant
decrease of the RUGO for two
[SPEAKER_02]: representative line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we try to understand the mechanisms
of why NIP 1-2, it's a function in
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing is that we measure,
I mean, stain the wild type and NIP 1-2
[SPEAKER_02]: mutant with hematocylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the dye that stained aluminum
in the cell wall, only in the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not in the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can see there's almost no
staining without aluminum, but still
[SPEAKER_02]: staining in the root tip region for the
wild type.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the strength of the staining much
higher in the mutant line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that suggests there's more aluminum was
accumulated in the mutant than the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: type.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the quantification for this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see compared to the wild type,
the wild type and the mutant, the mutant
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to accumulate more aluminum in the
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the cytosol, it is reversed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we see less aluminum was
transported into the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_02]: That suggests, I mean, NIP 1-2 is an
aluminum transporter responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake of aluminum into the cytosol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the working model for this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the NIP 1-2 responsible for
aluminum uptake from cell wall or from the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere and then moved to the
pericycle through the same plastic flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know if...
[SPEAKER_02]: NIP 1-2 is also responsible for the silent
uptake or it could, but it could have some
[SPEAKER_02]: other components.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely it's involved in the
aluminum translocation from root to shoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't show the slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we found that actually the
aluminum content in the shoe for the
[SPEAKER_02]: mutant is less than the wild type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this slide summarized
allopidopsis, aluminum tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually allopidopsis has adopted the
exclusion mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's involved the release of
mellicite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also we demonstrate that the true
tolerance mechanisms also function in
[SPEAKER_02]: allopidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in Xiaojian Zheng's group in
Zhejiang University, they have done a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of work on the cell wall part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a small plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very tolerant to aluminum,
but it has almost every no mechanisms for
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the last part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will briefly report on our recent
progress in dissecting regulatory pathways
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in resistant to low pH and
aluminum stress in allopidopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in allopidopsis, in Kayama's group,
they identify a mutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are highly sensitive to low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only to low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they screen for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they clone this gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it a stop one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It encodes a single-fingled transcription
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it's a master transcription
factor that can show many of the very low
[SPEAKER_02]: aluminum resistant gene like ATAMT1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a mellic transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ATMAID is such a transporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And AL3, also very important, but we don't
know exactly how it function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably it's function in the junction
of aluminum tolerance and
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphodeficiency resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a master signal transcription
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this part, this work is led by Fei
Jiang, who is a two-year visiting graduate
[SPEAKER_02]: student.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's very amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see in later, so has made a lot
of progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this diagram, the possible signaling
pathway for the stop one controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know stop one, if you knock it down,
it's hypersensitive to low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also all these genes are knocked down,
knocked out, and it's also hypersensitive
[SPEAKER_02]: to aluminum toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know these two processes are
independent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is that all of these mutants,
they are not hypersensitive to low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this work, we try to find some
component in any of this pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using traditional classic
genetics to screen revertence for the stop
[SPEAKER_02]: one phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here the result, I mean, this wild type
under low pH, and the stop one mutant is
[SPEAKER_02]: hypersensitive to low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the stop one revertent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see, it's not completely reverted,
but it says 80% or 70% reverted in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's some of the putative mutant for
the revertent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we try to test their response to
different stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, like aluminum, you see some of the
revertent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it's more resistant to aluminum
compared to its parenline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them is hypersensitive to
sodium, resistant to cadmium, compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: even to the wild type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are very sensitive to
cadmium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what's going on now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Fei Jiang decided to clone one of
these genes with the next-gen sequencing
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the revertent, and then crossed
with the stop one mutant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the F2 population, so for the long
root was the short root, and extract DNA,
[SPEAKER_02]: make a library, sequencing next-gen
sequencing, and can find a putative SNP to
[SPEAKER_02]: associate with a different phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last step would be verifying if
that's really the cross-type SNP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the result, the wild type,
and the hypersensitive of stop one and
[SPEAKER_02]: root growth at the low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the revertent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know this gene, and then we can
order the tDNA insertion line on this for
[SPEAKER_02]: this gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the tDNA, it's not sensitive
to low pH stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what if we incorporate the tDNA,
the dismutant, into the stop one
[SPEAKER_02]: background?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we see any revertent phenotype as
the EMS mutant mutation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's almost no difference
between the EMS generated mutant and the
[SPEAKER_02]: tDNA insertion mutant in the stop one
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much, we think we find out this
gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, that's the last slide,
and I would like first thank Leah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, I mean, I can't express more
my appreciation for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, I work with him as a postdoc,
as he mentioned, and also he hired me as a
[SPEAKER_02]: SY and work on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have 10 years work experience,
but I'm sorry he's leaving, but I think we
[SPEAKER_02]: are still collaborate, I mean,
close collaborate in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the work, I mean, the member in
the group that work in this project,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I cannot present all of their
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, John and Arif, and also thanks
for the collaborator and the funding
[SPEAKER_02]: agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I can, so this is Michael,
he work for the, most of the protein part
[SPEAKER_02]: of work, and Yiqi, he led the NIP 1-2
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Fei Jiang, he's a two year visiting
graduate student from Chinese Academy of
[SPEAKER_02]: Science, so he's leaving, I mean,
in the summer, but he led the stop one
[SPEAKER_02]: revert and project, so it's very amazing,
yeah, only two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you for your attention,
so I would like to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any indication that there's any
sort of signal from the chute coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough question, yeah,
we haven't looked in that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, could be, but mainly, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: the toxicity of aluminum is maybe
targeting at the root, root region,
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually chute is much, much less
sensitive to aluminum stress, and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant species like the aluminum
accumulator, like tea, broccoli,
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually like acid soil, they grew
better in the acid soil environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they did is like, uptake larger
amount of aluminum from the soil and then
[SPEAKER_02]: translocate it into the chute,
like the vacuum of chute tissues,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I don't know how this chute signal
coming back to, yeah, probably more
[SPEAKER_03]: important for the room than chute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing your field of research,
thinking not just signal, but
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic for the centering of
organic acid releasing, we've always
[SPEAKER_00]: wondered if you get more photosynthetic
going to those roots, and I think we can
[SPEAKER_00]: finally look at that, and where I'm going,
we can see 11 labeled plants, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: positron emission tomography, so we can
image the carbon coming, photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the roots, and at the same time,
we can image the roots and challenge them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room, or say just a specific room,
C of that, J of that, you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've always wondered, is that
going to turn on a signal, but
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic coming down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are losing, although the
plant, as he said, minimized how much it
[SPEAKER_00]: loses by adding just that little area,
but it's something we're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at when we move.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What amount of carbon is being exported
into the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't, I don't know if you have
any quantification, but actually we saw
[SPEAKER_02]: indirectly the carbon loss actually affect
the root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because we have the over-expression
line, or the melee or citrus release,
[SPEAKER_02]: and without aluminum, so the growth
actually is not as good as the
[SPEAKER_02]: non-characteristic line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some negative, yeah, definitely has
some negative impact on the root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it varies in species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sorghum seems to be really localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rabidopsis seems to be more spread out,
so they use one of the rabidopsis when
[SPEAKER_00]: they overexpress these transporters
without aluminum, and they still release a
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate amount, and they don't grow as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to depend on the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think the biggest,
the most dramatic, I mean, the example of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, though, is the lupins under the
deficiency in the hairy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can release 30% of the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not a crop plant, though,
you know, it's just surviving.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be a silly question,
but does the, when a plant grows in acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, does the pH of the epidermal
cells in the root change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidermal, you mean the, oh yeah,
I mean the morphology, there's lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: morphological change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on the morphology of the pH,
does the cytosolic pH change?
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH does not lay around that when
you're releasing the citrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Citrate, yeah, I mean, that's a tough
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really wondering what's the pH,
what's the form of aluminum being
[SPEAKER_02]: transported from soil to cytosol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely the aluminum, if that has to be
at the low pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know, I mean, probably the
microenvironment could be very different
[SPEAKER_01]: as to the epidermal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed like the interface of the
membrane would have to be acidified for
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about your acid chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got that citrate sitting in
a pH 7.4 cytosol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually being released as the
Lewis base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it comes out, it's, if anything,
it's going to bind to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I yelled at Marsha
about in his text.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have a book, an autograph from
him going, Leon, remember, none of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: right off the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he says organic acid release
acidifies, and it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not releasing the acid,
you're releasing the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already lost its protons and the
cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything, it might raise them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by releasing the protons and the
cytoplasm, it acidifies that region of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cytoplasm, you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some plants seem to prefer a set of
pH, like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they use the same mechanisms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the blueberry, they prefer low pH?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of the aluminum could have
some beneficial effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read some paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tea, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tea, yeah, tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also a paper that the aluminum
accumulation in tea is mostly in the old
[SPEAKER_03]: V.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you buy tea by good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might explain some of the behavior of
the British.
That actually was a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a health scare about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know a lot of the tea in China,
like growing around Shenzhen University,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an acetate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we prefer acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's green tea, so it's the fresh,
the young leaves?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the younger leaves actually
have less aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, join me in thanking our
two speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
