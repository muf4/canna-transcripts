[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so today I'll be talking about
genomics and high throughput phenotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: of cassava brown streak viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me if I need to point,
I need to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're talking about cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outline today we'll be talking
about cassava brown streak disease
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, which I'll refer to as CBSD
in the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also be talking about root
necrosis image analysis, CBSD virus titer
[SPEAKER_00]: quantification and also just a summary
from the findings of this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cassava is an all breeding species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bushy shrub that's grown for its
roots mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but in Eastern Central Africa,
they grow it for also the leaves because
[SPEAKER_00]: they use the leaves to make like stews and
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feeds over 800 million people in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of 2022, the value of cassava was
$4.9 billion in trade around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's propagating by stem cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what farmers do mainly,
but breeders, we could generate seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are always very difficult to
generate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite the importance of cassava in
Eastern Central Africa, this cassava brown
[SPEAKER_00]: streak disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a viral disease that's very
unique in how it expresses its symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, you could see a healthy
plant, but when you uproot the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like after 12 to 15 months after
planting, you will see the okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see these patchy necrotic
lesions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is always very difficult to eat
such cassava because it's the necrosis is
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and you can't boil the cassava and
you can't also feed it to animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cassava brown streak disease is a
positive sense, single stranded RNA virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the genus epomovirus and the
family potviridae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, potato virus Y, which is a very
common virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are common plant viruses,
but there are two species of this virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Uganda cassava brown streak virus,
and which I'll refer to as CBSV in the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation, the cassava brown streak
virus and the Uganda cassava brown streak
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both viruses cause 70 to 100% yield losses
in susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about the genomics of
cassava brown streak virus, just like any
[SPEAKER_00]: other pot virus, it's recorded as one big
polyprotein that tends to be cut into
[SPEAKER_00]: different pieces depending on the need,
you know, how the plant interacts with,
[SPEAKER_00]: how the virus interacts with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big difference with CBSV,
which is down, this is the genome of CBSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest difference between CBSV and
other viruses in the epomovirus genus is
[SPEAKER_00]: this Hamuan protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a protein that is not encoded
by all the other viruses in the epomovirus
[SPEAKER_00]: genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that it's because of this
protein that it's possible for cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: brown streak viruses to be transmitted by
white flies and not aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the virus in this genome for
vector biology, they encode the HC pro
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that helps with aphid
transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only difference,
but most times the proteins are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the distribution of
cassava brown streak disease, this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very old map from FAO, but I could tell
you what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cassava brown streak disease in the
1930s was discovered in the coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: regions of East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the virus would only survive at
altitude, at very low altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's below 1000 meters below sea level,
above sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but as of 2000, the virus moved up to
higher altitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has never been reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we have the Uganda cassava
brown streak virus because that's where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was discovered in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: While cassava brown streak virus was the
original virus that was at the coast of
[SPEAKER_00]: East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of last year, we have confirmed
cases in the democratic Republic of Congo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Zambia, and the central African Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would wonder why breeders in East
Africa are very interested in West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the food systems across
Africa, West Africa is highly dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava in their food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have alternatives, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alternative could be yam,
but everything is largely cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you imagine if cassava brown streak
virus moves from East Africa to Western
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, then we're going to face a lot of
food scarcity on the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're trying to make sure
that we breed for it within East Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: and not get it moved to West Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this virus, as I have mentioned,
is transmitted by white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many white fly populations
across Africa, but also the greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: transmitters of the disease are farmers
because they tend to carry infected
[SPEAKER_00]: planting material from one place to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how the virus has moved and also
evolved to different isolates and
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to find cassava brown streak disease in
the field, its foliar symptoms are not
[SPEAKER_00]: very threatening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see fluorosis along the secondary
leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never on the main leaf margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the secondary margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to confuse it for just normal
chlorosis sinensis, but with a trained
[SPEAKER_00]: eye, someone could see the leaf patterns
and know that this is CBSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also see brown streaks on the stem
if you take a good look, but also these
[SPEAKER_00]: also tend to happen on the botanical
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a sign of CBSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you uproot the roots, this is
always about 12 to 15 months after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting, you see the contriction in the
roots, but also when you cut, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark necrotic patches in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are symptoms of cassava brown
streak disease, and they cause up to $100
[SPEAKER_00]: million in economic losses in East Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are scoring cassava brown
streak disease, we have this one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring method that was originally
developed for cassava mosaic disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also works efficiently for cassava
brown streak disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a score of one means no observable
symptoms, while a score of five is the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest severity that you can observe
either both on the leaves or on the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to score these at three months
and six months after planting for the
[SPEAKER_00]: polio, because that time the root has not
developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you uproot cassava, you cannot,
you destroy the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to wait 12 months to look at
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for nearly 10 decades, because I
mentioned cassava brown streak disease has
[SPEAKER_00]: been around since the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we count, we've done a lot of
breeding for cassava brown streak disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've not identified markers that have
been biolidated in any population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to my work, we wanted to understand the
genetic architecture of cassava brown
[SPEAKER_00]: streak disease, conduct genome-wide
association studies for cassava brown
[SPEAKER_00]: streak disease, and explain these results
from a breeding perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are studying a pathogen,
but we are also breeders, so we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain it from a breeding context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as John Luke mentioned, the last 10
years, the NextGen Cassava project has
[SPEAKER_00]: been funding cassava research in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomic selection was one,
two that they promoted for rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And accelerating of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this genomic selection
population that was developed in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: years of the NextGen project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we have it, it's a sample to
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had 471 clones that were evaluated in
the clonal evaluation trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about cassava breeding,
we have a sibling trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a clonal evaluation trial,
advanced field trial, then the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a clonal evaluation trial is as much
diverse as the sibling trial, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: replication in this case that we don't get
in sibling trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted these trials in two
locations that have varying CBSD pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're CBSD, but the pressure varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then out of these 471 clones, only 320
clones were genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted these in an augmented block
design with three checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use spreader rows within the field
to augment the disease expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we have the population,
we had, we had different hypothesis that
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to test out how, you know,
the population performed best on the one
[SPEAKER_00]: to five scoring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we took root necrosis images because
we're curious, is this necrosis due to
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors or is it genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we did viral titer quantification
or viral load quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we phenotype the C2
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving ahead, I will talk about
definitions because as someone who works
[SPEAKER_00]: with both breeders and pathologists,
it's important to define the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I'll be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I talk about tolerance, it means
that this is the ability or the capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: of a clone to be infected, but still give,
you know, satisfactory yield to breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about susceptibility,
this clone has the ability to get CBSD,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, the disease varies or the
expression of symptoms varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I mentioned enhancers of
susceptibility, this is the likelihood and
[SPEAKER_00]: the severity of the infection best on the
symptoms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, when it's time to think about
viruses, I'll mention that this is best on
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus, but if I mention it anywhere in
the presentation, it's due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then incidence again is how frequent these
symptoms occur in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to the one to five scoring
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: This paper has been published.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the C2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to find out, you know,
just understand the population best on the
one to five scoring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research objective is we wanted to
evaluate the CBSD trait variability best
[SPEAKER_00]: on the one to five scoring method within
this population, establish phenotypic and
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypic correlations, then conduct GWAS,
both univirate and mild-variate GWAS to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify genomic regions that were
associated to these traits, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: provide information on functional and
attempted genes within those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about GWAS using the one
to five scoring method, for Kastava-Brown
[SPEAKER_00]: Streak disease, a few studies have been
conducted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to mention that Kawuchi's
population and Kayondo's population are
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents of the C2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did GWAS studies, and they found,
Kayondo found that CBSD at three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs on chromosome 11 were associated to
CBSD at three months after planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: while at six months after planting,
we only had SNPs on chromosome four and
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome three.
[SPEAKER_00]: No associations were discovered with the
CBSD at 12 months after planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same thing was observed with
Kawuchi that he only picked out CBSD at
[SPEAKER_00]: six months after planting, SNPs on
chromosome 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other studies within East Africa,
these are mainly best in Tanzania and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kenya, have done QTL studies with these
populations, Namikonga and Chiroba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a brief introduction,
in the 1930s, when CBSD happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders did cross no more domesticated
Kastava clones with the wild relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Namikonga, like a clone like
Namikonga or Chiroba is from that breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two studies have been done using QTL
studies, and you can again see that they
[SPEAKER_00]: pick out different genomic regions
associated to the different severity
[SPEAKER_00]: scores, either on the foliar or in the
root symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells you that, you know,
some work has been done, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to pinpoint which region in the
genome is actually controlling CBSD
[SPEAKER_00]: severity scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to my work, we did want to ask
what we were observing in the C2
[SPEAKER_00]: population due to genetics, environment or
genotype by environment interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did partition the variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that for the C2
population, most of the traits that we
[SPEAKER_00]: measured, CBSD incidence and severity were
highly genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: While when it comes to genotype by
environment interaction, you can see for
[SPEAKER_00]: root severity scores, that G by E is zero,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see is due to genetic or the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at variation in broad
sense and narrow sense heritability
[SPEAKER_00]: estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: For broad sense heritability, this is data
from the combined data, data from the
[SPEAKER_00]: different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see that the estimates generally
range from moderate to high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the same with previous
published papers for CBSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the same trend is observed with
narrow sense heritability estimate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they tend to be low to moderate,
depending on the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is again, the same as it's been
observed in other studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead to do univariate GWAS
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our univariate GWAS analysis,
you could see that we only picked out
[SPEAKER_00]: associations for CBSD at three months
after planting on chromosome 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 13, and chromosome 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned that the ancestors of
the C2 population, they picked out SNPs on
[SPEAKER_00]: either chromosome 4 or chromosome 11 in
our population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not pick out chromosome 4 or
chromosome 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead to do multivariate GWAS,
but it's important to note that on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 1 and chromosome 18,
there's an integration from the 1930
[SPEAKER_00]: populations that were developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have integrations on chromosome 1
and chromosome 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did multivariate GWAS,
we wanted to find out which regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which SNPs we identified in the univariate
GWAS were shared among these traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: would show up among these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we again saw that some of these SNPs
are shared across different traits
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this, we had confidence to
search for candidate genes within these
[SPEAKER_00]: regions to see what type of function do
these genes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we characterized gene ontologies,
which may not be very informative now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we wanted to cluster them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on molecular function,
you could see that we have genes in those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that control catalytic activity,
binding cellular processes, cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: anatomic entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion from this is the genes
that we received in this case would be
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancers of symptom severity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So symptom severity, because when you look
at the virus, how the virus proteins work,
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses tend to depend on the host for
their replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these help the virus reproduce
within the host, and that's how we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse severity scores within the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this section, CBSD
incidence in the C2 population,
[SPEAKER_00]: symptom incidence was at 44%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shows that while genomic
selection, you know, the gene genetic gain
[SPEAKER_00]: from a disease perspective, the diseases
still occurring in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had a moderate to high
broad-sense heritability estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low to moderate narrow-sense heritability
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: 77 functional genes, potential candidate
genes were found.
[SPEAKER_00]: The activities again help in symptom
severity within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will go to my second objective,
which was done in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, who used to work for BreedBest in
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the genetic analysis of
cassava-brown strain root necrosis using
[SPEAKER_00]: image analysis and genome-wide association
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about root necrosis,
if you remember the picture that I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you of the one-to-five scoring method,
we score the foliar symptoms twice in a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding cycle, while root necrosis can
only be scored once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to expand, you know,
how we could characterize the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: CBSD root necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So image analysis was the best option that
we thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that root necrosis is the most
devastating CBSD symptoms, because once
[SPEAKER_00]: you have root necrosis, you cannot eat
that cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we thought that image analysis
could expand this root necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question that we had is we've observed
these variations in root necrosis
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns, but were these variations due to
genetics or due to environmental factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was yet to be found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll show you what led to our
hypothesis of studying root necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that, you know, there are
different expression patterns of root
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We agree that, you know, this could be due
to, you know, environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be due to the isolates
within the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many factors that,
you know, lead to these necrotic patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected different images and used
them for analysis to study root necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used PlantCV, which is an
open-source, you know, software for
[SPEAKER_00]: segmentation of areas of interest in an
image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Python best method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have the ability to extract
features based on size, shape,
[SPEAKER_00]: color, texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we inputted images in PlantCV and
then we got an output file that we use for
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream data analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the experimental design in this case is
we collected five roots from each plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: a plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plot is made up of 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each plant, five roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our images were captured at the proximal
end of the root, the middle and the distal
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Images were collected in both locations
across both years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used tablets with field book to ensure
like it was a way of controlling the data
[SPEAKER_00]: we got that if we say this is a plot,
then it's an actual plot and an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: image of that plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's also important to notice that to
mention that numerous people captured
[SPEAKER_00]: these images.
[SPEAKER_00]: So styles in how they held, you know,
the tablets affected our downstream data
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis since we had to take out some
images since they were, they didn't meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the PlantCV criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took out numerous images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the research objectives we wanted
to characterize root necrosis image
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determine phenotypic and genotypic
correlations best with the one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring methods and also conducts GWAS and
also identify, you know, the genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this happened in image analysis,
just to give you, we would input a raw
[SPEAKER_00]: image in PlantCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we use different color spaces for
segmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up using the lightness,
the green, the magenta, the blue and
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow because this was better for us in
the segmentation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we would extract the morphological
features of the root disk like in this
[SPEAKER_00]: case, and also in another step extract the
image, the morphological features of the
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had an output file.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we ended up collecting data,
like the traits that we studied were the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the area of necrosis over the whole
area of the root disk times 100,
[SPEAKER_00]: the necrotic area fraction, the necrotic
width fraction, the solidity of necrosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and numerous other traits that
we studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were curious what these traits,
you know, what's the heritability of these
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at these traits, all the image
analysis traits, the broad sense
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability was generally low to
moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the percentage of necrosis had
0.42, you know, heritability, while,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the solidity of necrosis or
the covax area of necrosis had very low
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability, the lowest heritability
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see the trend, you know,
very low heritability and narrow sense
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability estimates associated with
these image traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also wanted to find out how these
traits really perform against the
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-five scoring method, because those
are scores that we're used to and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand best as breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see that some traits were
highly clustered together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are highly correlated traits,
while other traits like the solidity of
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis and the eclipse eccentricity of
necrosis were negatively correlated with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other root necrosis image traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we compare it to the one-to-five
scoring method, you could see that CBSD at
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 months after planting is, has good
correlations with, you know, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: root necrosis traits that are highly
correlated with each other, while the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar symptoms are not really that
correlated with all these other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at genotype by
environment effects on our population,
[SPEAKER_00]: on our image population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the serrere,
the serrere 2020 and the Mlonge in both
[SPEAKER_00]: years were highly correlated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Images from these populations,
from these locations were highly
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: While for the serrere 2019 has,
you know, a very different correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because in the serrere 2019,
we had a drought at this experiment and
[SPEAKER_00]: lost most of the plants that we had in
that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the images that we collected were much
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you plot this out, you could see
that the environment was different from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead to look at the variations
in phenotypic correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see again, their traits,
just like you saw in the biplot for the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, for the genotype by trait
interactions, you could see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some traits that are highly correlated
with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this bunch of traits
that, you know, have moderate to low
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we look at CBSD severity
scores, they have, you know, very poor
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations with all the image analysis
traits, except for a few with CBSD at 12
[SPEAKER_00]: months after planting, but it's still,
you know, very, little correlations like
[SPEAKER_00]: the correlation between the percentage of
necrosis and CBSD at 12 months after
[SPEAKER_00]: planting is 0.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a low correlation, but still
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same trends were observed with the
genotypic correlations that you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are bunches that, you know,
these are highly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have low to moderate correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, we have very poor
correlations, but following the same trend
[SPEAKER_00]: like with the phenotypic correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead to do, you know,
univariate GWAS and only two SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found associations with two SNPs with
two traits, the eclipse eccentricity of
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found SNPs on chromosome seven and 11,
which didn't show up when we did the
[SPEAKER_00]: univariate GWAS analysis with the one to
five scoring method, but has showed up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ancestors of the C2 population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, we see the percentage of
necrosis having SNPs on chromosome one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did multivariate GWAS and we did not
the different trait combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not find any significant SNPs with
the multivariate GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we looked at the gene functions
and you'll see, again, the same trend that
[SPEAKER_00]: follows that you see catalytic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see binding and all these gene
functions again help in enhancing the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility or the expression of the
symptoms within the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this chapter, we know that
teratability estimates were much lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than the ones of the one to five scoring
method because we thought, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using images would take away biases that
the one to five scoring method tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture, but that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw similar trends in genotypic and
phenotypic correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, SNPs only associated to two traits
were identified and the genes in those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, again, enhanced symptom
expression in CBSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my objective two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to the objective three, this was
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collaborate with the DSMZ,
which is a virus research institute in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the genetic complexity of
Casabrahm-Straight disease inside from
[SPEAKER_00]: QPCR-based viral titer quantification and
genome wide association studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work was done in collaboration with
Dr. Winter and Dr. Summer who work at the
[SPEAKER_00]: DSMZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about CBSD titer,
the spelling of titer depends on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trained with British English or
American English.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or viral load, you know, it's just the
concentration of the virus within a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on, you know, the method
that you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we use QPCR, you know,
we got CT values that we use to calculate
[SPEAKER_00]: relative amounts of titer within a plant
because we had a reference, a reference
[SPEAKER_00]: that we used and used that to detect the
amount of virus in our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this was done is we collected root
disks that we compiled together for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plot, like a composite sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those root disks were dried and
shipped to the DSMZ and then the QPCRs
[SPEAKER_00]: were done at the DSMZ and we got the
results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, our objectives for this section
was to assess a CBSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the two virus species of the
disease that we're studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Casabrahm-Straight disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBSV and UCBSD within that two,
within the C2 population, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish phenotypic and genotypic
correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, do GWAS, univariate GWAS and
provide insights into these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at both viruses in both
locations, you could see when we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence, this is plus his presence
minus his absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the presence absence of
CBSV, we see that CBSV is more prevalent
[SPEAKER_00]: across, you know, the locations and also
in the combined data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to UCBSV, but we know that,
you know, as we transplanted, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: from one year to another, there's an
increase of CBSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to explain what's happening,
why CBSV is more predominant than UCBSV is
[SPEAKER_00]: because some studies have shown that UCBSV
replicates much faster than UCBSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have a mechanism of stopping the
replication of CBSV so it may be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but it just doesn't increase at a
fast rate like CBSV does.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that the increase from one
year to another could be because we
[SPEAKER_00]: replant planting materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you imagine if the infection happened
in the first year and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: replanting that, you know, that clone,
you're still passing the virus over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation, giving it more time to
replicate and the virus to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also wanted to find out is virus
tighter due to genetics, environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: or genotype by environment interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could see for UCBSV, despite not
being very prevalent in the population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's highly due to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBSV, which is more predominant,
is due to, very little of it is due to
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, what we're observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at genotype by
environment interaction, you can see CBSV
[SPEAKER_00]: has high G by E, while UCBSV has low G by
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be explained by, again,
this is a limitation of our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not test the different isolates and
strains within our location where we
[SPEAKER_00]: planted these cassava varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that those isolates have
different interactions with the genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why we saw high G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward, we recommend that
breeders, you know, should periodically
[SPEAKER_00]: test for isolates in these experimental
areas to account for those in their
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at genotype,
when we looked at genotypic and phenotypic
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations, again, we see that they are
very poor correlations with the one to
[SPEAKER_00]: five sparring methods, both phenotypic and
genotypic correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to also mention that CBSV
and UCBSV were not correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings it to the notion that these
are two different viruses acting
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, despite both of them being
cassava brown streak viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did GWAS, and we found some regions
that were associated to CBSV titer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in GAPIT, that you see
chromosome 10, chromosome 13, chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 and 18 were associated to CBSV titer,
while numerous regions in the genome were
[SPEAKER_00]: picked out with UCBSV titer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these nips that we picked really
explained, you know, reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: proportions of variants when we compare it
to the one to five sparring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we looked at the proportions of the
genes in those regions of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we see these are enhancers of,
you know, disease symptoms as has been
[SPEAKER_00]: observed with all the other phenotypes
that we were studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also curious if we included UCBSV
and CBSV titer, viral titer as a covariate
[SPEAKER_00]: for the one to five scoring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: One we wanted to improve the precision,
but also there's the concept of tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if you account for titer,
then you could pick out regions that
[SPEAKER_00]: control tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has the virus, but then it
gives you good, you know, yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't pick anything when we used
CBSV viral titer as a covariate for the
[SPEAKER_00]: one to five scoring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the same trend was for UCBSV
virus titer as a covariate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing interesting came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summarizing this, both CBSV and UCBSV
are present in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so while we say that the
incidence was at 44%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is confirmed by the QPCR results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that CBSV, despite being
predominant, is highly controlled by
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, by environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes to our recommendation that,
you know, sampling and characterizing of
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates within location should be part of
routine breeding activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know, we identify that there are no
correlations between CBSV and UCBSV titer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the implication is breeders
moving forward should treat these as two
[SPEAKER_00]: different diseases and develop strategies
that are different from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also noticed that, again,
different genomic regions are associated
[SPEAKER_00]: to the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, again, drives to the point that
these are two different viruses that
[SPEAKER_00]: should have two different breeding
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude this talk, we had
researched the variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aim was to characterize the C2
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to expand phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the one to five scoring
method, introduced root necrosis image
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and large scale virus titer
quantification, which we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but based on this, there's no clear
cut method based on the one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring method that we could recommend for
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders have to do a cost benefit
analysis to choose either to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, virus titer quantification or
image necrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, more research is needed before
they could, you know, make those
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expanded our knowledge on CBSV
titer quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward, as we were talking,
you notice different groups tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify different genomic regions based
on the, you know, the population that they
[SPEAKER_00]: use, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are proposing that if, you know,
the cassava community could do a meta
[SPEAKER_00]: study for all these published papers and
have like a baseline, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That breeders could follow rather than
everybody have their own thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: own population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also recently the Latin American
lines, the lines that were characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBSV in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these lines don't, you know,
they have differential responses to CBSV,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the most important thing is they don't
get infected by either, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you could find the line that's not
affected by CBSV, but is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to use CBSV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breeders could integrate this in their
breeding populations and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop resistance since we've recommended
a different breeding strategy for both
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to acknowledge, you know,
my committee, that was John Luke,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Heck, and Keith Perry,
the NACRI team in Uganda, the John Luke
[SPEAKER_00]: Yannick Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the people from DSMZ, the NextGen
Project, and the Mueller Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the different, the SNPs that we
used were about 37,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That SNP gave us fewer SNPs, but there's
this imputation and work that had been
[SPEAKER_00]: done by Manning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we combined, you know, the former GBS
SNPs with the DAT-Seq to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: number to get them to 37,000, about that,
if I have it right of head.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most, like the one-to-five scoring
method and the virus titer quantification,
[SPEAKER_00]: we used the Baffaroni threshold for the
GWAS, which is very conservative,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root necrosis image analysis,
so we did the modified Baffaroni
[SPEAKER_00]: correction threshold where you calculate
for, you calculate a correlation matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: for the number of SNPs on each chromosome,
and then use that in calculating the
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a more flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's between, it's not the FDR,
it's not as less stringent like the false
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery rate, but it's also not very
stringent like the Baffaroni correction
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, so I tried out, again,
this is not like hacking a method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried out the FDR and I was getting,
again, too many SNPs that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it's a low threshold,
you get so much that you could not explain
[SPEAKER_00]: or interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to go with a stringent one
that I'm very sure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if a SNP passes that threshold,
then something has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be happening in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I think it's, because when we're
calculating narrow sense heritability,
[SPEAKER_00]: we use the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have markers that don't have like
high density markers, so that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: limitation to why we're getting no narrow
sense heritability estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a rough one in my head,
but we want to, because through the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, we generated all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program at Morag, we have all this
data in Cassava base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to rerun the GWAS analysis with
all these clones that were done and
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, we could, you know,
start talking about what we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_00]: any differences or any similarities that,
you know, could be used as a baseline for
[SPEAKER_00]: the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a rough idea, but I think
standardizing what people use for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, determining what's significant
in relation with CBST is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one to five scoring method has been
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have data from since CBST breeding
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize for thinking that everybody
knows that's the method, but across East
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa and Central Africa, the one to five
scoring method is the standard method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's using, that's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will do that best on the symptom
severity scores from the one to five
[SPEAKER_00]: scoring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Image analysis should be, should come in
if a breeder feels it would add value to
[SPEAKER_00]: their breeding program, but we're not
recommending it for all breeding programs
[SPEAKER_00]: because one, someone needs to know how to
extract the images from plant CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the analysis part of it is also
something that I don't think every
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program has capacity on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one to five scoring method is
understood and will be used.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three, we took images at the top
part of the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one image, the middle part and
the bottom part of the route, just the
[SPEAKER_00]: same format that they use when they're
scoring cassava brown striped diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will cut the route, I think three
times and then three times, not I think
[SPEAKER_00]: three times, then they'll give an average
score of, you know, the score that the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBSD score that they saw at the different
places in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the same method we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each route had three images.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, I think 150 images per plot.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not look at that specifically,
but we have the data to answer that
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's variability within the
different parts of the plant and does this
[SPEAKER_00]: vary within the plot and between plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, we didn't look at, but we have
the data to look at it in future.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a whole project on white fly
behavior with cassava brown striped
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not seen any research, any QTL
research from that group, but if they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, identify those regions,
then it would be possible to look at those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions and see how they, you know,
correlate or are the same with the regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're picking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also a limitation of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not account for white flies,
but we know that white flies did transmit
[SPEAKER_00]: the infection for us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is Richard, Ricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the collection of the categorical
disease, what was the data labeled and who
[SPEAKER_00]: collected the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky, the data was labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used a field book to collect this
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know, we know exactly what the clone
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have backwards scanners in the
field to help us identify which plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which plant is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second part of the question is,
do you think accounting for rater effects
[SPEAKER_00]: in your models would improve the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that breeders have, you know,
depending on who's scoring and their
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, they would give a different
score to the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did not account for rater biases,
but we know that that bias exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we try to use image
analysis to eliminate that bias,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did not get great results with the
image analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ricky, I hope that has answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Okay.
