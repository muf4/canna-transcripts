[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Don mentioned, I'm with the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a research geneticist, and I
specialize in abiotic stress, physiology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetics in grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grape is the topic of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grapes are one of the leading
horticultural fruits across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good to eat, but their end
products are also really important and
[SPEAKER_00]: lucrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Juice, raisins, table grapes, and of
course, wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that limits grapevines is a
narrow climatic band.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivated grapevine is a
Mediterranean adapted species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look here, pictured on the
map, I'm trying to get my orientation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which slides to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look, it is limited by a
temperature range between 10 and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius, which captures the
Mediterranean area and then grapevine
[SPEAKER_00]: producing areas you're probably familiar
with when it comes to wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, Chile, Argentina, South
Africa, Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that climate is changing,
and there are new challenges emerging when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to grapevine production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pictured here in red are grapevine
regions that we currently have that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to lose by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue regions are areas that we expect
grapevine production to be able to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: into, typically because of a warming
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with climate change, we're expecting
for winter to become slightly warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also expecting to have altered
weather patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those altered weather patterns do
not remove the threat of cold temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and limitations to grapevine production,
because I think we're all familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were here in the last couple years,
the polar vortex, which is a very common
[SPEAKER_00]: climatic event, but one that we just
haven't seen in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pictured here is a heat map showing
that polar vortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures dove down, caused a lot
of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in grapevines, both here in New York
and as well as in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just at a conference where all
of the producers and all the winemakers
[SPEAKER_00]: are cold climate grapevine producers,
so coming from Scandinavia, Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a meteorologist give a talk about
the polar vortex and about climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he did a really great job of
explaining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought I'd include that here
just so everybody has an understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: about how that affects growing grapes in
this region, growing grapes in areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: climate is not a Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traditional climate has a very cold
pole and very strong trade winds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which keep cold air during winter trapped
at the pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we experience warming and
preferential warming in the poles,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trade winds get weaker, and then these
polar troughs become more regular as cold
[SPEAKER_00]: air is able to slip out of the poles and
dip down into areas where we were not
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally experiencing such cold
snaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flip side of that is there's also
warming peaks that occur in contrast to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of a generally warmer winter,
we're faced with a more erratic winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: where there are going to be episodes of
much warmer temperature followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes of much colder temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wreaks a lot of havoc on grapevines,
particularly when you're pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture down here on the bottom is
another example of some of this weather
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon as it affects horticultural
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom panel here is a picture of the
Midwest of America, in April of 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is April 4th, this is April 22nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the greening up,
that's the trees and the horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: crops all bursting, breaking bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this year, 2007, we experienced what
was a polar vortex, although we
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how far advanced the green
was when you compare these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the polar vortex,
or the spring freeze, you can see how much
[SPEAKER_00]: of that foliage died back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2007, I don't even know the billions of
dollars that were lost in horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: crops because of this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these events are expected to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not always necessarily bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: With climate change, there's also new
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm from the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan, which is this peninsula up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't realize that this is
actually attached to Michigan from this
[SPEAKER_00]: corner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very surprised to see that grapevine
production is moving north in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here along the coast of Michigan,
there's a lot of wine trails, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: good hybrid and vinifera wines get made
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, this little peninsula here,
there's a winery there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see by the suitability map,
there are some regions where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: projecting that it is more suitable for
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you from the snowfall levels
that this is not going to be a fun place
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to realize that there are
challenges coming with climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's also opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's my job as a geneticist,
studying cold hardiness in grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to figure out the most efficient
way to get us through the challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: take advantage of the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at New York, where we're all
familiar with, a picture on the left is
[SPEAKER_00]: the grape growing regions of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a picture on the right is the
hardiness map put up by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that there's a correlation
between the dark purple areas on the left
[SPEAKER_00]: with the green areas on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because temperature is the primary
limiting factor affecting agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: production in general, but definitely
grape production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, the European grape vine is
adapted to Mediterranean climates,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it likes it nice and hot in the summer
and dry and mild and cool in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that evolutionary history,
it isn't adapted to deal with our winters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly if you go further north
or west and north from here, cannot deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is only cold hardy to around negative
20 to negative 25 C, which is negative
[SPEAKER_00]: four to negative 13 F.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll apologize right now, not all of
my slides have C and F included.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the range we're looking at for
cultivated grape vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our most hardy cultivars in this region
are like Riesling and Cab Franc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cab Sauv, they can survive to these
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of the backdrop against
what my job is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goals of my position are to
understand and clarify what the physiology
[SPEAKER_00]: is and what the phenotype is of what we
say cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also supposed to identify wild and
hybrid germplasm that we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance grape vine breeding to make new
varieties that are better adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supposed to characterize the complex
architecture of those genetic architecture
[SPEAKER_00]: of those traits, and then assess genetic
mapping populations in order to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate genes that play major roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a number of tools that I can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly is the USDA cold hardy
grape vine germplasm, which if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, we house in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 1300 different grape vine
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all cold hardy hybrids and wild
grape vine species that can survive our
[SPEAKER_00]: winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other half of the grape vine germplasm
is in Davis, California, where all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated varieties and cold sensitive
varieties are kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a pretty amazing resource here,
and I definitely stress you should check
[SPEAKER_00]: it out sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I perform a lot of physiological
measurements of grape vine bug survival
[SPEAKER_00]: and phenology with both field and lab
based work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to employ next generation
DNA and RNA sequencing technologies to
[SPEAKER_00]: move it forward to identify the
complexities behind these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already kind of alluded to this,
but wild vitus is very important to grape
[SPEAKER_00]: vine improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listed here just a sampling of adaptive
traits that we would really like to have
[SPEAKER_00]: in cultivated varieties that we can find
in abundance in wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about cold resistance
today, but there's also differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil adaptability, rooting, pathogen
resistance, ripening, differences in vine
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture, fruit flavors and nutrition,
and then bud burst and declamation,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll talk about a little bit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the major wild species that we
have in the cold hardy germplasm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 20 wild species in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm picturing a few here and
introducing their names, not expecting you
[SPEAKER_00]: to know them all, but just to give you a
sampling of the diversity that we see when
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all sort of ringed around the
outside with vitus vinifera, Riesling in
[SPEAKER_00]: the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labrusca, Cenaria, Estivalis, Riperia,
Rupestris, and Vulpina are all major
[SPEAKER_00]: species we have in the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitus amurensis is something from Eastern
Asia that's used a lot in Russian and
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese great breeding efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I mentioned, vinifera is in
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are roughly 20 species in North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something like 40 in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adapted to different abiotic and
biotic stresses because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary path and where they have
adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pictured here four different
distribution maps for Rupestris,
[SPEAKER_00]: Labrusca, Cenaria, and Riperia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bright green is a county level
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they differ quite a
bit in how prevalent they are and what
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of our country they cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, cultivated grape is cold
tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative 20 to negative 25 is its limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas cold hardy wild species can reach
negative 35 to negative 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much can go below negative 40 and
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ultimate temperature for wild
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to talk a little bit
about what do I mean by when I say cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness and cold, yeah, cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complex trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what tissue you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this talk, we're going to be speaking
mostly about dormant buds, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: includes phlolem and xylem, the lifeblood
of the plant, as well as the cambial
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these tissues have to deal with
freezing stress in our climate and they
[SPEAKER_00]: may or may not use the same mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are differences in the genes that
contribute to cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's differences in the physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether or not you are able to export
water or increase sugar concentration or
[SPEAKER_00]: modify with cryoproteins, all of this can
be different in these different tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also mechanical differences
between the tissues and whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: they can prevent the movement of ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have tissue barriers that block
ice propagation in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also multiple versions of cold
hardiness depending on what season you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm picturing here on the bottom is a
timeline going from fall through to
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get a very hard, cold frost
early in the fall, you can knock the vine
[SPEAKER_00]: down and do damage before it's ready for
winter temperatures and thus impede its
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to survive the rest of the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have massive cold events during
the middle of winter, which simply surpass
[SPEAKER_00]: the defenses of the plant and kill the
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have too warm of a spring,
you can bud burst early and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to frost damage depending on,
like I told you, those troughs and peaks
[SPEAKER_00]: in the weather can really affect the fall
and spring of bud phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes down to looking at the
winter, there's two major groupings,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not you have a mild or cold
winter, so the intensity of the winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the stability of the winter,
whether or not you have very punctuated
[SPEAKER_00]: swings in temperature or you have
sustained cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to talk about two,
of all the complexity I introduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about two portions of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwinter bud hardiness, and endodormancy
and bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left is the standard
acclimation-deaclimation curve associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants going through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the fall, they react to changes in
light and temperature, gaining cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness and moving down this U,
so they're acclimating ahead of freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the middle of winter, they're at
their most hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the spring, as temperatures
rise, they deacclimate at a rate that is
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than they acclimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can assess whether buds are surviving
winter and where they are on this curve by
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting them and looking for damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the left is the compound bud of
grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary buds, secondary and tertiary,
all are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bud survives, well, until we cut its
head off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The center bud here has sustained damage
in the primary bud, which is brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third bud here is completely dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a producer's point of view,
you could get fruit off of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get only vegetative growth
off of this, because the primary bud is
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruitful bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have any vine growth,
and you're probably going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace your vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endodormancy and bud burst is another
topic we'll get into in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we assess the state of
dormancy and the ability to grow by taking
[SPEAKER_00]: buds from the field and putting them into
growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's pictured here on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that I have these two traits up
here is because they interact and overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the acclimation and
deacclimation period, you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in dormancy going on in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm trying to decide or trying to
figure out how interconnected these two
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits are with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we separate them and identify advanced
germplasm for each of those traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the most sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thought is that because the floral
tissue has more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my fifth grade drawing of what
it's like to be a cell that experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: cold snaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a cell on the left,
and those are all the good bits on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you have a spike of cold
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what we know, the cell tries to
get rid of as much free water as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: because free water freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get ice crystallization between the
cells or perhaps just outside the plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of freezing is safe,
and it occurs at around negative 5 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the HTE, or high temperature
exotherm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cells that have this ice form are under
stress from that ice, but also from
[SPEAKER_00]: dehydration and membrane fusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of processes going on
when you have ice formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As temperatures drop, the buds super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they suppress their ability to freeze
to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some temperature, and this varies
throughout the winter and by genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: that intracellular water can no longer be
kept from freezing, and it freezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That signals the lethal event in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, the bud is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly is happening when that ice
happens, we don't quite know, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, there's a whole suite of
tolerance and avoidance methods that are
[SPEAKER_00]: postulated to play a role in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Differences in membranes, cryoprotective
soluents, chaperones, sugars, suppression
[SPEAKER_00]: of ice crystal formation, tissue barriers,
all of these are thought to play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can evaluate where the buds are on that
cold hardiness U using a method called
[SPEAKER_00]: DTA, differential thermal analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we take the bud,
here's the dormant bud, make an incision
[SPEAKER_00]: across the bud cushion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a cross section, keeping this
tissue intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into these trays, stack the
trays in a programmable freezer,
[SPEAKER_00]: then slowly freeze the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the temperatures are decreasing,
when you hit the HTE, that safe freeze,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a spike of water freezing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a peak of heat, and we recognize
that as a change in voltage across these
[SPEAKER_00]: plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the safe freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you continue to drop in
temperature, you hit the lethal events and
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the buds dying here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these little spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is all winter long,
we go out and collect tissue, put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: these chambers, record these peaks,
average the peaks and figure out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% lethal point is, and use that as a
method of measuring where the buds are on
[SPEAKER_00]: that U.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the last three years, I've done
this with seven different species and
[SPEAKER_00]: about 33 different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to show you all of the
traces because it's way too overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what it looks like is the
top right corner here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the minimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the temperatures in the black
jagged line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Riesling and Concord.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solid lines are those LTEs,
the lethal temperatures, and then the dash
[SPEAKER_00]: line is just a trend line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that Concord is hardier
than Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something we know very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look across these seven species
and all these genotypes from hardy to
[SPEAKER_00]: tender, we basically come up with the
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riparian amurensis are the most hardy
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the rest of the wild species are all
within, oh, I lost, there we go,
[SPEAKER_00]: all within about a degree of each other,
as well as Scinaria labruscoe rupestris
[SPEAKER_00]: and vulpina.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the wild species are hardier than
the hybrid varieties, and those hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: are hardier than vinifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly the two ends of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riparian amurensis are very hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrid and vinifera are very tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at 2012, 2013 here,
I'm only showing you riparian amurensis
[SPEAKER_00]: and hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we had this black dash
line is the freezing point, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we had a, this is a pretty
mild winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures go back and forth across the
freezing point several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that hybrid amurensis and
riparian are all about equally hardy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but way more hardy than temperatures
demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this cold event, you can see a
slight dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're responding to the cold
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a warming event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amurensis responds by deacclimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then throughout the rest of the
winter, you have this divergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in a warm year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cold year, 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the lines are further
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more hardy in this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the blue line, which is the hybrid
line, is the least hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you have responses to temperature
and deacclimation all the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is last year, which was also a very
cold year, but it was a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: cold year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having lots of temperature
swings throughout the winter, we had
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely cold temperatures for two months
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the lines are much
less wavy, and this cold event here pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the genotypes, even the sensitive
hybrid varieties, far, far hardier than we
[SPEAKER_00]: had seen previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the type of winter really
matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last year's winter that we had pushed
hybrid varieties way past what we would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect them to normally be able to do,
simply because the right types of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pushed down and kept down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't allowed to deacclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the type of winter determines the
extent of bud cold hardiness as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: the genotype does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see I drew the dashed red
line to indicate the hardiest point for
[SPEAKER_00]: riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the first year,
the hardiest point is sensitive relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of this being is the buds do not
super cool to maximum potential unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to, unless they're pushed to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be some sort of active
part of this going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the other points for riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just see that it gradually got
more and more hardy across the three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assessing bud cold hardiness using LTE is
location and year dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes it really hard to use to
track down genetic traits, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always changing with the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still tasked with figuring out how
to breed for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the genetic architecture of this
trait, and can we breed for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that, I looked at Vitis riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is that northern North American,
very adapted, cold hardy wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here it has a huge
distribution, and it goes well into
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't track where it is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked at 43 different varieties of
riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go sort of fast through
this part, just show you the variation
[SPEAKER_00]: across those 43 different individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's 2013, 2014 cold year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the LTEs for the different
riparias.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'll begin to notice is that they
don't all follow the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not all responding to
temperature the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some that are sensitive,
some that are hardy, some that are
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive, some that are static.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's across the whole year, or the whole
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the most recent winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the same sort of trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even when everybody's pushed as hard as
we can push them, you still get a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to the end of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, at any point in either one
of the winters, there's 10 degrees Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: range of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of stuff that we can look
at for breeding material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's great potential for
incorporating some of this new material
[SPEAKER_00]: into breeding programs that include
riparia for grapevine breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing is, northern
varieties did not come out as always the
[SPEAKER_00]: most hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first year here, varieties that
were hardier than negative 32 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius were from Montreal, Montana,
Ontario, and Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois is considered south in this
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in last year, we again had lots of
northern material, but also Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This trait does not appear to be tied to
geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be locked within the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to move to the next
trait, dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dormancy is a process that occurs
throughout the growing season and
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the dormant season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts during the growing season with
paradormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the growing tip is
suppressing the growth of buds behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what happens when you prune a
plant and it gets really bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You release it from paradormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's controlled by hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next type of dormancy is endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what occurs in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light changes, cold temperatures drop,
and the canes and vines ripen off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they turn from green to brown,
getting woody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called paraderm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It advances from the base of the cane to
the tip of the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it travels, the buds that are
covered in that paraderm are ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what keeps these buds in
this state of endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something molecular metabolic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out during the endodormant
period and hack off a vine, stick it in
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and try to get the buds to grow,
it won't burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something keeping those buds
silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you successfully complete
endodormancy, you move on to ecodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a state where the temperatures
are keeping the plant dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go and cut a vine in ecodormant
stage and put it in a hot glass of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an environmental form of
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it gets warm enough and growth
resumes, the plant goes back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it gets there too fast and we have
a frost event, then this happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we lose the fruit-producing parts of
the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this is related to cold
hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the dormancy clock works is the
buds somehow keep track of the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time that they spend between about zero
degrees Celsius and seven degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an optimum area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They count the hours throughout the whole
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's depicted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two winters, 2012, 2013, so warm
versus cold, in this green shading is that
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet spot for that dormancy clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the buds are tracking temperatures
throughout the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this tells them when it's safe to
burst in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I zoomed in here just in the yellow box
on the same dates across those two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: the warm winter and the cool winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we imagine that we want to get to
12 o'clock noon before we burst and look
[SPEAKER_00]: at this region, you can see that in the
warm winter they made it to seven o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this chunk of time, in the next year
when it was cold, they only made it to
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is you need much less warm
on the other side of this bracketed area
[SPEAKER_00]: to burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in this year, you can see
that they've got plenty of chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds burst and we got frost damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, this same amount of
chilling didn't mean the same amount to
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds because the clock was slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that you grow
things in regions that have, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: a clock of 12 that you don't have and that
you don't grow things that are gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: supercharged in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the chilling hour slash
dormancy clock looks like from across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can read these numbers
or not, but it starts with zero in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never gets below seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants that would grow in Florida
wouldn't need chilling in order to fulfill
[SPEAKER_00]: their dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gradually gain more dormancy as you
move up the country, along the coast where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cool, up in the Pacific Northwest
where it's cool, and then up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Plains, there's actually very few
chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because their temperature swings
are so dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through from summer to winter so
quickly that that sweet zone is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: very tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can evaluate what the chilling hour
requirement is for different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: for different genotypes by a simple test,
collecting the vines, putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: cold storage in that sweet spot,
and then testing how fast they burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data looks something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cabernet Franc, Cab Sauve,
and Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the start of the experiment,
you can see that they take quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days to burst, but as you add chilling,
they get faster and faster and faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a given set of hours,
at 1,000 hours here, you can see that Cab
[SPEAKER_00]: Franc and Riesling are fully chilled and
they're bursting really quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cab Sauve is lagging behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the consequences of not being fully
chilled is that you have desynchronized
[SPEAKER_00]: bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leads to desynchronized flowering and
desynchronized fruit ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a good trait to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, this is Riesling that's
fully chilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Cab Sauve that's not fully
chilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are bursting at different rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look across wild grapevine,
these are the trends in what the species
[SPEAKER_00]: do when faced with chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to notice that all the species
respond in the same way to chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all need chilling to burst,
and they have the same reaction to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of chilling, but they start at
different spots in the Y intercept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so different species and genotypes
have different chilling requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's low-chill, rapid bud bursting
species, moderate species, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: high-chill, slow species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These tend to separate along a
northern-southern gradient as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have an adaptive trait in this
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can select specific germplasm to
breed for these different traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at this in riparia,
again, we could look at this with 43 lines
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show you 43 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to show you a standard
riparia line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is riparia's response to
increasing chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets faster and faster with the bud
burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chilling hours are going up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud burst stays on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the maximal range of variation
within the 43 riparias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the riparia lines fall between
this blue and this green line.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is that the steeper the slope
is, that indicates that that genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: response more to a given unit of chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the position on the Y-axis indicates
the endodormancy barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the higher you are on the Y-axis,
the more dormant you are through the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we imagine that we breed with these
riparias and then put the hybrids out into
[SPEAKER_00]: North America, where we're growing hybrid
grapes, pictured here is North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska, and New York, and the chilling
hours that you typically receive in those
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, if you planted,
for example, the green variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: in all three locations, you have very
different bud burst rates, because their
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling hours and seasons are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add climate change and winter
warming to this, you shift these all to
[SPEAKER_00]: the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're thinking about breeding
for cold hardiness from a dormancy point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view, you have to be thinking way ahead
to the shift in climate, the increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you can see it's even more
important which varieties you choose,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the faster you break bud,
the more susceptible to frost you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the 43 different genotypes of
riparia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow is southern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called them southern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is northern.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the two columns is the average LTE for
the two years I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there is no apparent
trend between darker red with northern or
[SPEAKER_00]: southern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LTE trade is sort of shared across all
of those individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you then include the dormancy
information as slope and Y-intercept,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's the what slope and Y-intercept
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluer in slope means you react stronger to
the chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue in the Y-intercept means you have a
higher endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there seems to be a possible
association between the southern having
[SPEAKER_00]: higher endodormancy and a higher response
to chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the north, there's more red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you tend to have lower endodormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's several potential
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look across these traits,
that might be good for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd want red in the slope,
blue in the Y-intercept, and then also
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy in the LTE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've highlighted a few of them
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this is from Missouri,
Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Montana,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that you have the option to
breed with far more material if you
[SPEAKER_00]: consider southern riparia in a grapevine
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to do a quick shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the phenotyping effort that
I've been leading in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to figure out these traits,
trying to figure out how much of it we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use in grapevine breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's only so much you can do in the
field because, as I showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: every winter changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets very frustrating to try to run
a controlled experiment when the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps changing on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we take the field
research to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can take hints from the field
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that all the species react the
same to chilling, increasing both their
[SPEAKER_00]: bud burst rate and their synchronicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endodormancy and LTE traits seem to be
a little bit tied to one another,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe that's only by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's variation within riparia,
suggesting that endodormancy may be
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And LTE may be a species static trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I want to know, can we determine
the mechanism behind these traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is I'm going to introduce my
student, Al Kovaleski.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on trying to dissect
deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to look for the correlation of
deacclimation phenotype and bud burst
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we took Vitis amurensis,
Vitis riparia, those are those cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: hardy wild species, and Vitis vinifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we subjected them to a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here are some of the stats on the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amurensis and riparia are fast
deacclimators, limited chilling hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fast bud bursting species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In vinifera, we have slower deacclimation,
slower bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at Riesling and Cabernet
Sauvignon, you'll see that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big difference there in the
chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can compare the normal bud burst
rate with a delayed bud burst rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is we take a whole bunch of
canes from the field, put them into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing conditions where everything is
controlled, and sample the material for
[SPEAKER_00]: bud hardiness, check it for bud burst
phenology, and then look at gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of what the
experiment looks like on day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can see that amurensis has
green swollen buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned it's the fastest bud
breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at riparia, Riesling,
or Cabernet Sauvignon, and you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds, they're not breaking bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of what our
data looks like as we're taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several hypotheses associated with
the gene expression when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes of deacclimation, bud burst,
and cold hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the field data, we would think
that deacclimation genes would be on in
[SPEAKER_00]: all genotypes, but would be tied to the
actual rate of deacclimation for each
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud burst genes should be all upregulated
and also tied to the rate of bud burst for
[SPEAKER_00]: each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that genes that are important for cold
hardiness and cold survival should be
[SPEAKER_00]: massively downregulated because there is
no longer a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we collected hundreds of
cuttings on February 2nd, and here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: chilling hours in the field on February
7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 750 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that amurensis,
riparia, and Riesling are all fully
[SPEAKER_00]: chilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cab Sauvignon is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's their field deacclimation response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from LTEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that riparian amurensis are
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesling and Cab Sauvignon are slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their bud burst phenology in this
experiment reflected their chilling hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had amurensis first, riparia second,
Riesling third, and Cabernet started
[SPEAKER_00]: bursting about the same time as Riesling,
but it was really stretched out because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not fully chilled, so not
synchronized.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data is showing you the deacclimation
rate, 22 degrees for riparian amurensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these data points are the cold
hardiness levels measured by LTE each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, in these dashed lines,
is the temperature of some control canes
[SPEAKER_00]: we left in the cold room at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treated exactly the same, but kept at
four degrees instead of 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at cultivated grape,
here's the deacclimation rates at 22C and
[SPEAKER_00]: at 4C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing you'll notice is that
the rate of deacclimation of ecodormic
[SPEAKER_00]: buds is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slope is not different amongst these
four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is totally in contrast to what we
see in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we think is this happened because
we put them into 22 degrees Celsius 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day, which is not a realistic
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem with going from the
field to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you overshoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically put them in a maximum
growth rate condition, and they all
[SPEAKER_00]: deacclimated the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at 4 degrees C, you see that only
amurensis was deacclimating at a different
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that that species is able to
respond to much cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would make sense from a field
point of view, because it deacclimates
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest in the field as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you spend much more time at four than
you do at 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this experiment, we decoupled
deacclimation and bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't look at gene expression
patterns in the same way that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: planning, but we can still look at what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are days zero through D8.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the deacclimation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the days that we sampled for
RNA-seq.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes that have shared expression that are
important for deacclimation are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be about the same for all four varieties,
because they're all deacclimating at the
same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes that have a staggered expression
pattern are going to be tied to bud burst,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're bud bursting at different
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genes that go down are related to
cold-hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we collected material on
each of these days for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, ground them up, and did
extractions for RNA, and then sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: that RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure how many people have done
RNA-seq in here, but basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we sequenced over almost one billion
RNA-sequencing reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an enormous data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we cleaned it up, we have about
500,000 reads in this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take those 500,000 reads and align
them to the genome and try to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: which genes are turned on, which genes are
turned off, out of the 32,000 predicted
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated grape genes, we picked up about
13,000 to 16,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from almost a billion points of
data to hopefully just 13,000 to 16,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is still a massive data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you then apply some statistics and look
at significantly differentially expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, we can cut that data set way down
to the max 4,000 genes in vitus amurensis
[SPEAKER_00]: are on or off in this experiment,
and in riparia, just under 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a massive data set to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how we're going about looking
at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're unfamiliar with microchip
analysis or RNA-seq analysis, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: a heat map of RNA-seq data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue to red indicates down to up gene
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue genes are down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red genes are up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here in this cluster
and this cluster is that the genes start
[SPEAKER_00]: out down-regulated and gradually increase
in gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between these two is
this one, I guess you could say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually up-regulated, whereas this is
early up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the transition from blue to red is
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this box and this box are
down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are down-regulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they start high and they end low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this little box here,
you can see they start blue, go red,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are genes that are coming on,
probably starting a signal cascade and
[SPEAKER_00]: then being shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are peaking genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are our gene numbers we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amurensis I'm showing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the 3,923 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each line is a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at up-regulated genes that are
found in all four of our different
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes, there's only 447 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is much more manageable than even
3,000 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at genes that are shared in the
down-regulation category, there's roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: 230 across all four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can look at these genes and see
what sort of differences in gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression are going on in all of these
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked some just at random.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't choose this because there's a
tada moment coming or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to show you some of the gene
expression patterns and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that we're identifying that are
related to, in this case, deacclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, deacclimation occurred
equally among all four varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd expect gene expression to be more
or less all up for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some of that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellin, 3-beta-hydroxylase,
Ox1.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things related to hormones,
gibberellin and oxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: ABC transporters, lipid transporter
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can see the y-axis
here, but it goes from something like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,000 to around 18,000 expression units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So massively up-regulated lipid transfer
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Histone deacetylase is important for
actually shutting genes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ties up the DNA into histones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is interesting that they're
up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cupin here, which is cupins have
been seen to play a role in germination in
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this makes sense in a
deacclimation process and a process that
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud is getting ready for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a picture over here is a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellins, oxins, lipids, like we said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, the colors of the lines
here are indicated by the genotypes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same color.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want an easy key, blue and
green are wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange and purple are cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genes involved in bud burst,
we would hypothesize that these would be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on fastest in ammurences because it
bursts fastest, followed by riparia and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the viniferas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see from this that we
actually need to extend our experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond day eight because we're not picking
up a lot of that cultivated response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here are six genes that are
up-regulated rapidly and we think could be
[SPEAKER_00]: playing a role with bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: TS01 is a floral organ differentiating
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The floral meristem is probably becoming
activated.
[SPEAKER_00]: GSA4 has a role in gibberellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethylene has a role in alpha tubulin and
alpha extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both expansion and elongation
type genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oxygen response factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growth things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at down-regulated genes,
here's another sample of just six.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plex stringy or pH domain protein,
that's the only information we have on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it goes from something like 14,000
down to 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So massively down-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a role in membrane transports.
[SPEAKER_00]: SRC2 has been picked up in soybeans in
response to cold work regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes sense, another good
candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: DREB genes and worky genes are both
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That play a role in cold hardiness,
dehydration stress, even some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses depending on the family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Galactanol synthase plays a role in
getting rid of raffinose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And raffinose is a sugar that's been seen
to be up-regulated in response to cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes a lot of sense, it's being
shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with any gene expression study,
you get a whole bunch of genes that have
[SPEAKER_00]: no function attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unknown proteins or no hit proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them have really cool gene
expression patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the top are two that are
down-regulated quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two on the bottom are up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are genes that we don't know what
they do, but they clearly play a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process they're picked up in all of
our samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a whole category of stuff
that just has weird gene expression
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns that we can't make a lot of sense
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take it all with a little
bit of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shown you a little bit out of that
450 and 230, but what we're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out candidate genes and
pathways that play a role in these
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we identify pathways that are
over-represented within this data set?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could then say, the deactivation
pathway is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you get to work with if
you're looking for doing pathway analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why I'm not going to show you
today because I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the metabolic pathway in grape
for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just cold response or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, I did one pathway I zeroed in
on because a lot of the candidate genes I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in the data set were picking up in my
memory about flavonoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a grad student and I had to do
my preliminary examination, I had to write
[SPEAKER_00]: a grant on flavonoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it finally paid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw that there's lots of these
genes that I recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought I'd remake the pathway
just to see what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the pathway that leads from
phenylalanine to flavonoids or to
[SPEAKER_00]: monolignols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all go through this sort of
intermediate which is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to the left of this,
you turn into a flavonoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the right, you turn into a
lignol.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really not important that you
know what their names are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe you know chalcone synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that plays a lot of role in flower
color and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this pathway would lead to color
and at the sign-ins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is peroxidase just in case you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have flavonoids or
monolignols.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the genes in that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up almost every single gene
differentially expressed in all four
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes in this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that it's not always the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shared expression down, shared
expression down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amurensis and riparian are starting to
pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much shared expression across the
lignols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get to the flavonoids,
amurensis is way up and riparian is way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that maybe in riparian
and amurensis, the flavonoid pathway is
[SPEAKER_00]: playing a bigger role in getting those
buds ready for bud burst or geoclimation
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you see all the genes are up
here, the expression level of this isoform
[SPEAKER_00]: is much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just gives us an idea of what might
be going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's that whole pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pink is down-regulated, green is
up-regulated, and dark green is massively
[SPEAKER_00]: up-regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of get an idea of maybe
some of the pathway that's playing a role
[SPEAKER_00]: in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hope would be to take all of the
genes, not just the few that I showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but apply that to some pathway analysis
and then determine if there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the metabolism that are unique
to different species or unique to perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference between cabsov and
riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you sort of like a buzz through
physiology and phenotyping and next-gen
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a lot of future plans with
this sort of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at more controlled
freezing experiments where we take all the
[SPEAKER_00]: canes into the cooler in the beginning of
the season and subject them to freezing
[SPEAKER_00]: and warming in a controlled manner so we
can sort of see their response to
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at both endodermal and
ecodormant deacclamation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we looked at today was ecodormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to do some diurnal sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Al's not particularly happy with this,
but we're going to go out in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be sampling every four
hours over several days to try to get how
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes are being turned on and off as
they warm up during the day and then get
[SPEAKER_00]: cold at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get a better handle on how much
gene expression actually occurs near zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we'd like to move this to
association transcriptomics and look
[SPEAKER_00]: within mapping populations to try to find
EQTL associated with dormancy,
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with deacclamation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one area that's massively understudied
is cold hardiness in trunks and canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something we haven't touched at all
here, and it's not something that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done much work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, we'd like to move into
that area to try to get a whole vine
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would just say thank you
to the people at USDA who support this
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: My technician is Kathleen Dease and a
previous technician, Jacqueline Lillis,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a farm crew, Bill, John,
Bob, Greg, and Nancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, of course, my student,
Al Kovaleski.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been helping out a ton and is going
to be helping out a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Reich is his co-advisor,
and Tim Martinson and his team,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Wilsey, Steve Luce, Beth Takis,
and Lynn Johnson is with the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics group.
[SPEAKER_00]: She helps me out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got some other collaborators
on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't even see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing's in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anne Fennell, Dan Chitwood, Michaela
Centinari, and Grant Kramer, these people
[SPEAKER_00]: all play a role in these same sorts of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we all kind of work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just ask if there's any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to answer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
