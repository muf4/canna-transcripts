[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'll introduce our next speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is Cornell researchers and
talking about some of the work that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are very fortunate to have Dr.
Ginny Moore here with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny Moore is an assistant professor of
plant breeding and genetics at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her lab breeds new crop varieties for
organic and sustainable cropping systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: including work on perennial forages,
cover crops, alternative and alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: crops in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ginny also does a lot of work with looking
at hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have questions about hairy
vetch and where things are going with the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety development there, she's the
person to talk with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also work with Ginny on some
perennial grain crop production,
[SPEAKER_00]: some turns of work with her students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, really fortunate to have Dr.
Moore here at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also joining the panel today or as part of
this research group, we have Dr. Solveig
[SPEAKER_00]: Hansen, who is a research support
specialist with Dr. Ginny Moore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solveig joined the lab in January,
2023, where she coordinates research and
[SPEAKER_00]: outreach for the nationwide cover crop
breeding network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solveig earned her PhD in plant breeding
and genetics from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin-Madison in 2020, where she
conducted genetic genomic and
[SPEAKER_00]: participatory research focused on flavor
in table beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: In her postdoctoral work at the University
of British Columbia, she coordinated a
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada-wide farmer variety trialing
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of experience working with
farmers and doing variety trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: participatory breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other person is Seem Seth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Seem is a third year PhD student in
plant breeding and genetics, working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mark Sorrels on barley genetics for
organic and conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this work is to release
malting and naked barley varieties adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: for the environmental stresses present in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main goals is to introduce
pre-harvest sprouting resistance with
[SPEAKER_00]: elongated dormancy to the breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very happy to have our researchers here
from plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give them a round of applause just
to help welcome them.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Solveig.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a research specialist in Ginny's lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked mostly with cover crops,
but when I came here, I was glad to join
[SPEAKER_07]: this project, looking at Mississippi and
winter local production in this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: This project was created by Peter Martin
and Kristen, hoping to find ways to
[SPEAKER_07]: diversify both crop rotation and market
opportunities for farmers in this area.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we looked at both a winter team variety
trial and a winter lentil feeding grade
[SPEAKER_07]: study.
[SPEAKER_07]: For both trials, we had replicated plots
on a research station so we could do
[SPEAKER_07]: statistics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we complimented those with strip
trials on Peter's farm to kind of give
[SPEAKER_07]: some context to what we were seeing on the
research station.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the winter lentil trial, it could only
really source one of the total variety,
[SPEAKER_07]: Morton, which is a Turkish red lentil
group.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did the seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a side rate, which you'll see
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We looked at standard health in the fall
and the spring.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we did a panel harvest on the
research station so we could separate
[SPEAKER_07]: lentils and weeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: First year, we tried lentil monoculture,
all planted, and we found a lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, with all those weeds,
fine wheat and chickpea done replicated
[SPEAKER_07]: plots there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of field baby and Peter's plots.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw no significant difference for any
trait that we tried to measure because the
[SPEAKER_07]: weed pressure just was too strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: But great learning experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: We figured maybe to get the lentils a
fighting chance, we need to add a nurse
[SPEAKER_07]: crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the second year, we did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We added winter oats.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it worked, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we... Well, the pointer's not gonna
work for me, but you can see that as the
[SPEAKER_07]: seeding rate goes up, so does the plant
population.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Using the winter oats and the nurse crop
allows the lungs to establish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we were able to answer this
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we increase plant density, do we also
increase lentil yield?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answer is, kind of inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll see that the table was sorted by
lentil yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the highest numerical yield was sort
of the 55 pounds an acre treatment,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was the highest seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you'll see that that gave us 63 plants
per quadra, which is about double what we
[SPEAKER_07]: got from 40 pounds an acre seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the grain yield didn't increase by
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The portion at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't see any statistically
significant differences between any of
[SPEAKER_07]: these degrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have great evidence that
seeding more than 40 pounds an acre is
[SPEAKER_07]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really have one year of data on
this, so it's inconclusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can find results.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Peter did get the highest yield at 50
pounds an acre, but the next highest was
[SPEAKER_07]: the 40 pounds an acre.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, did you come to a conclusion as to
what seeding rate you would use in the
[SPEAKER_07]: future?
[SPEAKER_09]: Last fall, I planted 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all of the seed is high and up and
then down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, a little above the point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I looked at lentil yield data collected
by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: They collected lentil yield data in like
four Western and Great Plains states.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those averaged between 600 and 1,100
pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really right in that range,
which is pretty cool that we can get those
[SPEAKER_07]: yields here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the biggest conclusions from the lentil
trial is the nurse trial to get them to
[SPEAKER_07]: establish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we didn't see great evidence that
anything, any seeding rate greater than 40
[SPEAKER_07]: pounds an acre is going to be worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the green peas, we were able to source
a great number of varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sourced these from Pro-G.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I understand your original question,
the most commonly planted variety around
[SPEAKER_07]: here is keystone, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is Jay?
[SPEAKER_07]: He just spoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: You broke your key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he broke.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was focused entirely on actual food
grade science.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our question was, can we find a great
variety that will be better than keystones
[SPEAKER_07]: for yield?
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first year, we saw significant
differences for all the traits we
[SPEAKER_07]: measured, except for wheat biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's satisfying.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw some trends.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw that I kind of gave you an Olympic
medal ranking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first group are shorter plants with
more stem.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did best for yield and best for
protein content.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a middle ranking, the silver ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our taller plants have fewer stems,
also more protein content, and then some
[SPEAKER_07]: lower performance at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got similar results on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all the varieties in each of these
groupings are the same, even though Peter
[SPEAKER_07]: has a slightly smaller subset on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were thinking like, hey,
maybe we're discovering a real trend.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then came year two.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our field on the research station was much
wetter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Much more prone to disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the varieties that really did well were
the indeterminate, binding ones that can
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of grow out of the disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of lodging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the more determinate varieties,
the semi-leakless ones, they detached from
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil at the soil level.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was so much soil borne disease.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that drove these results.
[SPEAKER_07]: The two varieties that did really well,
keystone icicle and icicle, were those
[SPEAKER_07]: long indeterminate varieties.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see the strong difference between
the plant height and the prism standing,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the inverse of lodging.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in different conditions, different
plant architectures functioned best.
[SPEAKER_07]: Important to realize that harvests of the
lot were difficult for these plots because
[SPEAKER_07]: they were so voluminous and binding.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did mechanical harvests on these with
great effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a saw harvester that we borrowed from
the sorrel team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your harvester did fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to talk about what you used?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a honeybee flexgraper with an
aerial.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really upset them when I sent them a
video of just cruising through the plots.
[SPEAKER_09]: No problems at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're like feeding it in with like a
twitch crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, okay, so on the research station,
we measured yield differently the two
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So first year, we had much more controlled
plant size.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did quadrat harvests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Second year, massive plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did mechanical harvests.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we could rate which varieties yielded
best or in which order in both years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can see by all this crossover that
some varieties did much better in the
[SPEAKER_07]: drier years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some varieties did much better in the
wetter conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did find some nice horizontal lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: So herwood and goldenwood were the ones
that did well or slightly above average in
[SPEAKER_07]: both years, in both those drier conditions
and the wetter ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heastone was more a relatively stable
variety, but it was slightly below average
[SPEAKER_07]: in yield both years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are computers involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: So similar variety ranking over both
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you decided whether you're going to
change varieties from Heastone?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't actually plant any of this fall
because we kind of got and we don't have a
[SPEAKER_09]: market right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that we probably will look
at again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heastone was good.
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue with Heastone is team weevil,
which we haven't touched on, but it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: major problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder, do you think that's different
between varieties?
[SPEAKER_09]: I suspect that we're going to see team
weevil in any of the yellows or greens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're more palatable for the
team weevil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a whole other frontier.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be dramatic differences in
yield levels between yield years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the second year yields between 1,000
and 2,000 pounds are also in line with the
[SPEAKER_07]: USDA average yields for the wetter stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: The upper half of those are in line.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first year was a real buzz.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a hypothesis on what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that there might be a little
gap between the Triticale and the winter
[SPEAKER_09]: bees that suppress the bees.
[SPEAKER_09]: The winter oats are something that we've
been working on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had oat contamination that survived the
winter and some of our wheat in 2021.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been developing that line.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oats can have a little heavy, but I am
hypothesizing that it does not have a
[SPEAKER_09]: little heavy effect against the bees,
which didn't suppress the bees.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bees were able to do a lot better in
the spring when they came out of dormancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's interesting because we grew our
research class with Triticale as well,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it was a different strategy than we
were using, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be one of those variety crop
interactions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we're talking about with sunflowers
and rye.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen that in other a little pathy
research that it is very cultivar
[SPEAKER_07]: specific, cultivar and species specific.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing to consider because these
are being grown for food production is
[SPEAKER_09]: that a lot of the lentil and pea markets
are looking for, if not certified
[SPEAKER_09]: gluten-free, some assurance that it is
gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're using Triticale, that is
glutenous grain.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're using oats, that is gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is not glutenous grain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it may give an easier entry into the
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're a lot easier to separate
because Triticale best weight and pea best
[SPEAKER_09]: weight are too similar.
[SPEAKER_09]: Triticale best weight and pea best weight
are quite different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here are the conclusions of the pea
trial.
[SPEAKER_07]: Performance really differed by the amount
of moisture and the pea type.
[SPEAKER_07]: So some, I believe, was more determinate
versus we normally can get in less
[SPEAKER_07]: determinate.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have extended results in those
handouts if you want to dig into bigger
[SPEAKER_07]: and yield and protein content and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will leave it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take a question or two if there are
some while we get these presentations set
[SPEAKER_07]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to have the oats out there because
it aids in harvest.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the spring oats, there's a concern of
smother when it winter gilts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because especially in linden, the growing
point remains under the surface over
[SPEAKER_09]: winter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they have a hard time pushing out
with that dead mulch, then you worry about
[SPEAKER_09]: them getting started.
[SPEAKER_09]: That winter oat also creates just a lot of
biomass to fall into the combine so that
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't lose as many lentils in
shattering.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because lentils are extremely prone to
shattering once they're ripened on the
[SPEAKER_09]: farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: This past year was kind of an anomaly on
every front, but they hit right together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the lentils, it was definitely really
hard for me to kind of identify when
[SPEAKER_07]: they're ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the lower part of the plant is
still greenish and the upper part is
[SPEAKER_07]: yellowish brown.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pods are brown.
[SPEAKER_07]: The rest of the plant is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you wait until the whole plant is
brown, all the seeds are already on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's something to learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, father.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is another effect or benefit from
the oats.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It does provide some biology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: It suppresses insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in addition to suppressing weeds,
it's also suppressing some of the diseases
[SPEAKER_08]: in insect problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one more.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we briefly know before we bring
him into the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be around later.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be transitioning back to
talking more about rad, which we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about quite a bit this morning already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I do that, I just want to mention
sort of the broader work that we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: on cover crop breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't talk about the other species that
we're working on in our lab, but just to
[SPEAKER_04]: say that Solveig and I together lead the
Cover Crop Breeding Network, which is this
[SPEAKER_04]: national group of plant breeders and
farmers and agronomists and a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of folks all working to develop improved
cover crop varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the network started out working.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we initially started doing breeding
work on vetch, pea, and crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last few years, we added rye
and winter canola, additional species in
[SPEAKER_04]: the network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the work that I'm presenting today
is kind of some initial work that we
[SPEAKER_04]: started doing as we were getting to know
rye as a cover crop species and getting to
[SPEAKER_04]: know the genetics and management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Systems in our lab and the work was
supported by the USDA Organic Research and
[SPEAKER_04]: Extension Initiative, or EI, as well as
the New York Ag Development Program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll see a lot of the work happened
in the northern tier of the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this figure is probably not news to
most people in the room, that rye is by
[SPEAKER_04]: far the top planted cover crop in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was one of the main
motivations for adding rye to our breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: network.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's planted on a lot of acreages and a
lot of potential impact if we can improve
[SPEAKER_04]: the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of the reasons that the area
mentioned at the beginning of her talk,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a consistent winter hardy,
very productive cover crop, has a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways on different farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Erin also mentioned the importance of
planting in a timely fashion, getting it
[SPEAKER_04]: in early in September, which can be a
challenge depending on the rotation that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's planted in.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a plant breeder, I'm always looking at
things with the lens of how do we use
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics as a tool to either improve the
performance of cover crops or make it
[SPEAKER_04]: easier for farmers that are not yet using
cover crops to incorporate in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we know, as Erin was talking about,
that biomass shows complete clear decline
[SPEAKER_04]: with later planting dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this had implications for the benefits
that you're getting from cover crops,
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly weed management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a figure from the outside in
Alabama, but we see it's the same term in
[SPEAKER_04]: other regions as well, including here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dates are different, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this second figure is from a
meta-analysis in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that at this, around 4,500
pounds per acre, that we can be a 75%
[SPEAKER_04]: reduction in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this particular set of studies,
that was the target.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Erin talked about much higher
levels of biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was specific to no-till systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So certainly, depending on the
application, you might be looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: different performance of the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the purposes of my presentation,
I thought about this 4,500 pounds per acre
[SPEAKER_04]: target number.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I'd be really interested to hear
what other folks are targeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: In different systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the data that I'm presenting,
this is, you're getting caught up the
[SPEAKER_04]: presses of this analysis that I've just
started doing the first time I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: presenting it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be really, I'm excited to get
feedback from folks about how you might
[SPEAKER_04]: want to see the data analyze differently,
or what kind of context is important to
[SPEAKER_04]: consider as we're thinking about these
numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so my question really is, we started
out thinking about whether variety
[SPEAKER_04]: selection can improve performance at later
planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So acknowledging the reality that
sometimes that the mid-September date
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't realistic and specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the given system or given year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we still achieve sufficient levels of
biomass to see some benefits, even if we
[SPEAKER_04]: plant a little bit later?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the, variety cover crops that
are planted are with variety not stated
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not using this tool to target and
improve the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the studies that we've seen
that have evaluated planting dates are
[SPEAKER_04]: testing just one or very few variety
varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not really accounting for potential
genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within the species.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we wanted to know is, is there
variability among varieties that are
[SPEAKER_04]: already on the market for performance when
they're planted later?
[SPEAKER_04]: And can some varieties be planted late and
still accumulate enough biomass to provide
[SPEAKER_04]: some value for farms?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did a planting date by variety
experiment over a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we planted, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've planted in two years,
so fall 2022 was the first year that we
[SPEAKER_04]: planted the experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We continued the next season as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We planted on four dates, so late
September, early October, mid-October and
[SPEAKER_04]: late October to early November.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that first planting date might be in
the, so we targeted around September 25th,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is the recommended kind of
deadline from NRCS.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of the later planting dates are in
these really marginal times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not ideal, not recommended generally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we planted again, a seeding rate
that's lower than what Erin was
[SPEAKER_04]: describing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is also based on the NRCS
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not specific to no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would take results with a grain of
salt defense system that you're targeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you might see higher biomass values
at a given date if you're planting at
[SPEAKER_04]: these higher seeding rates that you might
need for no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would expect that the trends may be
similar, but higher final biomass at
[SPEAKER_04]: higher seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we planted this experiment at three
research farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the Freedale Research Farm,
close to Ithaca, and then at the Extension
[SPEAKER_04]: Learning Farm in Hanson, and the Shazy,
the Minor Institute in Shazy, New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also planted not a planting date
experiment, but just the same varieties on
[SPEAKER_04]: three farms as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to present the on-farm data
because I really wanted to focus on this
[SPEAKER_04]: planting date question, but just to say
that we saw fairly similar variety
[SPEAKER_04]: rankings on the farms as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we planted six varieties in the first
year, and then added eight more in the
[SPEAKER_04]: second year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so I'll get into the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first thing, as expected,
we saw these planting date effects,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in general at the sites we saw
declining biomass with later dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exception we had was one year where in
Shazy, where we had some disease issues
[SPEAKER_04]: and a couple of earlier planting dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had a more comparable performance
across the dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were differences, but they weren't
in the order we expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a caveat for that site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And variety also was clearly important
across all of the sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So variety did matter in terms of the
final biomass production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in most cases we didn't see an
interaction between planting date and
[SPEAKER_04]: variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: This indicated to me that you could plant
the same varieties were the best
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of the date you planted them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't necessarily need to switch
varieties if you realize that you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to have to plant the same variety
regardless of the timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exception was in Freeville in the
second year, we did see some rate changes,
[SPEAKER_04]: although I'd say the groupings remained
pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And okay, so getting into the nitty gritty
of the variety performance at site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll go over first the sites that
didn't have any interaction effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first I would say, so in Canton we had
really low biomass production across all
[SPEAKER_04]: of the dates and varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, although the variety rankings
were quite similar across the different
[SPEAKER_04]: sites, I would call the Canton site a
failed establishment across the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not going to focus on that data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also think that the data in the
first year in Shazy is a little bit less
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting because everything did pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything surpassed that 4,500 pounds
per acre biomass threshold regardless of
[SPEAKER_04]: planting date and variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this data maybe doesn't really help
answer the question as much either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's these remaining sites where we
had, we're right at that threshold of the
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum recommended biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some varieties on some dates were
performing above the threshold and some
[SPEAKER_04]: were performing below.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first site, I'll talk about the
second year in Shazy, the most interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: planting date was this October 17th date.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was the third planting date in the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about half of the varieties still
surpassed that 4,500 pounds per acre
[SPEAKER_04]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the threshold, if we change
the threshold, it will be a different
[SPEAKER_04]: number of varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that really, that planting date had
the most variability because the data on
[SPEAKER_04]: the table are the average across the
dates, but I know in the boxes,
[SPEAKER_04]: the ones that still passed the threshold
on that third planting date.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even in the October where they were
able to produce a pretty decent amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Freeville in the first year,
the second planting on October 12th,
[SPEAKER_04]: we only had two varieties, Elvin and Andy
Gardner that surpassed that threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last site is the one that has
the interaction effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the data here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, so there's some dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this first date, all of the varieties
surpassed that 4,500 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the three and four,
nothing did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the second planting date,
which was October, again, about half of
[SPEAKER_04]: the varieties passed that threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see there are some common
varieties that met that threshold across
[SPEAKER_04]: these three different marginal planting
dates at these three locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Andy Gardner and Elvin,
in all three years, were among the top
[SPEAKER_04]: performers and surpassed that threshold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Ryan and then Renzo Busi were
only planted in the second year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in those years that they were planted,
they also performed quite well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, so to me, this says that there
is potential for genetics to help push the
[SPEAKER_04]: boundaries and allow on these marginal
dates, suboptimal dates that you still
[SPEAKER_04]: could, if you plant an appropriate
variety, could be better performance done
[SPEAKER_04]: with other varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then I want to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Briefly about the breeding work that we're
doing on this front.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in addition to evaluating varieties
that already exist on the market for this
[SPEAKER_04]: performance at later planting dates,
we also want to know if we can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: intentionally breed to improve performance
of rye at late plantings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is work that's led by my PhD
student, Raksha Papa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she, as part of this Northern New York
funded project, planted a nursery at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Williamsboro Research Farm along Lake
Champlain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've planted both at this more
northern location than where we are in
[SPEAKER_04]: Ithaca and at a later date in the hopes
that we would experience some challenging
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions and really challenge and stress
our rye nursery and be able to make some
[SPEAKER_04]: good selections for more winter hardy and
productive varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had our first winter nursery there
last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've now planted an evaluation of
that population, but we also have some
[SPEAKER_04]: populations that we've selected in a
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one concern with any of our work
selecting for improved winter hardiness or
[SPEAKER_04]: improved germination under cold conditions
is that environmental conditions are
[SPEAKER_04]: variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't predict when we're going to have
a good selection year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we want to develop tools that we
can more predictively make good
[SPEAKER_04]: selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've been evaluating this tool
called the Thermo Gradient Table to see if
[SPEAKER_04]: that can help us do this work more
efficiently and predictably.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is basically a table that has
tubing running underneath and we have
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature controlled baths that
circulate through the table so we can
[SPEAKER_04]: control the temperature and have quite
cold soil temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can also have a gradient of
different temperatures so we can evaluate
[SPEAKER_04]: the same material in the same experiment
across multiple temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we planted a mini nursery in the table
evaluating germination and vigor at very
[SPEAKER_04]: cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: So close to freezing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we even, in some cases, had ice
formation on the top of the surface of the
[SPEAKER_04]: table and still had rye plants emerging,
which is pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was definitely a hardy, resilient
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a couple of cycles of selection
from this breeding approach and what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be comparing this coming spring,
the performance of both the controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: environment selections and the field
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Evaluating it in Willis-Burow and at the
table to see how correlated the selections
[SPEAKER_04]: are between controlled environment and
field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only can we select things in the
controlled environment, but does that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually translate to improved field
performance or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, David, next year hopefully at
this meeting to tell you the answers to
[SPEAKER_04]: that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, really excited about this area
of research and looking forward to
[SPEAKER_04]: learning more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will leave it there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, thanks to the folks who have
supported this project through
[SPEAKER_04]: collaboration and funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to put a plug in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just this week started distributing a
survey focused on rye to guide the rye
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding priorities of this new program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're looking for farmer input on
breeding priorities, but also folks in the
[SPEAKER_04]: seed industry or extension, anybody that's
working with people that are producing rye
[SPEAKER_04]: or processing rye or working with rye in
various types of businesses and education
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you interact with rye, please follow
the QR code and let us know what you
[SPEAKER_04]: think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we really appreciate your input
and it'll guide the future work that our
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding programs do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have soil data and I didn't analyze
it and include it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly the soil types are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't tell you exactly what the
different soil types are, the different
[SPEAKER_04]: locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also like our failed site,
I think had some fertility issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would guess that's why we had such low
biomass production compared to the other
[SPEAKER_04]: sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, and the free-bill location is
very gravely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the shady location has pretty
nice soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I was surprised at how much we
had overlapping varieties that were the
[SPEAKER_04]: top performers given the huge variability
in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we know we had the very
different soil conditions and weather
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions in the different sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it seemed promising to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only two years of data, but promising
that there were some varieties that were
[SPEAKER_04]: fairly consistently high performers even
at those late days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Sine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a third year PhD student working in
small grains breeding and genetics lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wanted to mention here originally
born and raised also on organic farming,
[SPEAKER_03]: southwest Estonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know what you guys are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly, the problems are really
similar to what we work with here in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York in terms of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm mainly going to talk about
today is small grains breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Small grains breeding program established
at Cornell is actually coming from 1906.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more than 100 years old,
which is really fascinating for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And has a focus on investigating small
grains and releasing varieties that adapt
[SPEAKER_03]: to the local conditions for about a while
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But more than 100, 19 years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening today at our breeding
program is mostly focused on breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: winter wheat, mulberry barley,
organic naked barley, that's what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also MRI corn spelt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, with those varieties,
we're also trying to combine that with the
[SPEAKER_03]: latest research that's available to
improve our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as we can with some of those
topics that we are focusing on,
[SPEAKER_03]: like breeding methods, molecular genetics,
characterizing different traits that are
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also determination and multi quality,
which has been one of my focuses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to kind of give a little bit of
background, why we're even around low
[SPEAKER_03]: barley at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we've heard a lot about having
crops that are out there on the fields in
[SPEAKER_03]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gives the farmers good wheat suppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Improves the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also enables us to break the disease and
pest cycles out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think with barley, there's a little
bit more than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an example, I think barley is one of
the most adaptable varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one anybody could put out on their
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has relatively low inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really can survive on a variety of
soils and environmental conditions out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, then product itself can be used
for several different causes like malting.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has been one of our main interests in
our lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal feed and also food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to kind of get closer to what I'm
going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the naked barley, there's two types of
barley that I want to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: distinguish really clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we usually use to see out on the
fields and use for making malt for our
[SPEAKER_03]: brewing industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is 99% covered barley.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to hold around the grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But another opportunity that we're working
with a bigger USDA funded grant is native
[SPEAKER_03]: barley that doesn't have to hold around
the grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this enables for smaller farmers or
local producers to get the more high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality product that needs less mechanical
processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could potentially eliminate some of
those nutritional elements that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody seen naked barley out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this laser is going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get that going really quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the difference between the hogs
and the hogs barley is all about the hogs,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And interestingly enough, we have
witnessed something in the evolution of
[SPEAKER_03]: barley that has caused a single phase
fermentation in the barley in the gene
[SPEAKER_03]: called the new gene, interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it has done, it has provided a
naked barley that in a way that eliminated
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of political clue between the grain
and the hog itself, enabling us to lose
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole of the barley grain during the
harvesting already, without the need to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through the polishing or the deholding
process that could lose important parts
[SPEAKER_03]: like the germ and the bran of the grain
that have a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would also make it not possible
to call that a whole grain anymore if
[SPEAKER_03]: those parts are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why would anybody want to grow a naked
barley at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just mentioned easier to process
and handle, as there's also no need for
[SPEAKER_03]: this expensive machinery that would cause
increased expenses and lose the nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I think it's a great potential
for a higher market value due to its
[SPEAKER_03]: health benefits like increased variable
gain and also those nutrients that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't lose in the process of deholding or
polishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it still has a variety of uses
that one could find.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's most fascinating for me is the
potential to diversify the crops in the
[SPEAKER_03]: region and also address the consumer
demand for local organic products as other
[SPEAKER_03]: barley products or other ways I feel are
sometimes a little more complicated to get
[SPEAKER_03]: out to the end products to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this using or growing a naked
barley is a good way to simplify the
[SPEAKER_03]: process of product development from the
farm to other department marketer for its
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf of the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are part of actually this bigger
friend funded by USDA Organic Research and
[SPEAKER_03]: Extension Initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Multi-Use Naked Barley for
Organic Systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: In there we have five different
universities all across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and also some regional people that help us
to get the knowledge out to farmers and
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an example, we have the Collingwood
Center for Regional Food and Farming here
[SPEAKER_03]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all true that we had all meet up
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is this project about?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a multi-year project and it's
covering a lot of goals actually to be
[SPEAKER_03]: honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't listed them all out here but
it's been a more detailed I don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: that much time but everybody can leave
them out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, what I'm gonna get out from
here is to show our multi-faceted approach
[SPEAKER_03]: to doing several things at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to breed new and naked barley
varieties for farmers that are adapted to
[SPEAKER_03]: local growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want the best varieties that are
already out there and at the same time
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna increase this knowledge out
there that the public would know more
[SPEAKER_03]: about naked barley and its benefits and
also the consumers and farmers and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody that could come into contact
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To conclude, I could kind of squeeze all
those goals into those three points that I
[SPEAKER_03]: just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Identifying the varieties that we could
grow now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding the right genetics to generate new
variation that's even better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And educating farmers and the wider public
about the benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually have those organic naked
barley trials going on in Ithaca for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been testing winter and spring
varieties out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I have just been reading out a
couple of things I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: For farmers the winter barley has been
really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No big issues with winter survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's been fascinating for me is that
we haven't seen really significant
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in the yield by natural
multi-barley varieties or the varieties in
[SPEAKER_03]: the organic environments that are naked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can imagine that we see like a small
yield bus but I think that's mostly coming
[SPEAKER_03]: because the grains we harvest don't have
the hull.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hull already weighs something so we
can't really think of that as marketable
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also grown spring varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to have some issues with
drought and some drought here but overall
[SPEAKER_03]: also been performing well in the pink
lakes region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've also had a lot of focus on
trying to quantify the resistance for
[SPEAKER_03]: different traits that we have flying
around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like xerium headlight, smart and also
trying to keep down some of the down
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulation in the grains to make sure
it's marketable in the food industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else have we noticed about those
trials is even the very low gain levels in
[SPEAKER_03]: naked barley are high which is really good
for people's digestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can complicate using naked barley in
mulching processes which is important here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also that we are not having too many
problems with the wheat management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that most of our problems are still
originating from different bacteria and
[SPEAKER_03]: fungicides that live out there and want to
share the crop with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, due to that we have kind of
developed a breeding strategy to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: other universities together to found these
breeding populations by pressing different
[SPEAKER_03]: already covered lines and non-covered
lines in terms of just getting those good
[SPEAKER_03]: traits over from those varieties that have
raised for like as an example for mulching
[SPEAKER_03]: barley or for like having those for
longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because interestingly enough, what I need
to mention is that those covered and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-covered bodies have been well
desegregated for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know that they used to be one
before this new mutation happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess now they haven't been passed
to each other too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do have relatively different
genetic backgrounds that we can exploit by
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing them with each other and seeing
what could help us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the main things we're doing with
naked barley in Cornell is growing out
[SPEAKER_03]: different populations within this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing out diversity population to
see is there any exotic or interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: trait that we could map down genetically
and exploit that in a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also growing out the breeding
population where we're constantly
[SPEAKER_03]: generating the new variation and selecting
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third field that we're growing out
in Cornell has been those regional trials
[SPEAKER_03]: where we test our best spring and fall
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: All across those locations in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
and also states, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our main focus here has been on the
traits that are important for the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties growing in New York,
which for those lines is winter survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have starting resistance, drought
resistance for springs, disease
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance, and also weak competitive
ability that a former graduate student
[SPEAKER_03]: called Bunzey used to do some science on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I want to share with you the
overall pipeline that we have been sending
[SPEAKER_03]: those varieties to over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we are in the second cycle of
this project, we already have those lines
[SPEAKER_03]: that we crossed a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, we already have a pretty
many new trials that we can make better
[SPEAKER_03]: selections already for some potential line
candidates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I'm just explaining why it's so
important to test those traits here
[SPEAKER_03]: locally.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we see, we might face relatively
different conditions as one would face in
[SPEAKER_03]: Minnesota at a phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are just some examples what I've
witnessed in my fields in terms of winter
[SPEAKER_03]: kill, in terms of adaptability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here on the picture on the right,
you see some of the diseases that are
[SPEAKER_03]: climbing up those leaves in the summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you look into the canopy,
there's a whole life going down around
[SPEAKER_03]: those leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're still trying to quantify.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my research mostly with native body is
focused on pre-apserotic resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to quickly define what is
pre-apserotic, pre-apserotic is something
[SPEAKER_03]: that happens with those body grains on the
field as the moisture increases.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might show me that on the field,
depending on their genetic background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which has been a reasonable amount of
being in South Central New York in July
[SPEAKER_03]: when the rains are hitting us hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one thing is if it happens on the
field, we can't really measure it every
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have developed a method to measure
that inside a greenhouse with an
[SPEAKER_03]: artificial misting array where you just
harvest five spikes from every genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try them out three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And put them into the misting chamber for
three days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of exposing those lines due to
those human conditions to get this score
[SPEAKER_03]: of susceptibility to pre-apserotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is an example we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a zero to nine score.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we see how most of these lines
don't have any pre-apserotic in those
[SPEAKER_03]: grains after three days of being
completely full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: As when some of the lines have genetic
backgrounds that just have almost every
[SPEAKER_03]: grain in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when this happens, it doesn't matter
if it's naked barley, or just a molten
[SPEAKER_03]: barley, or any wheat barley.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that no farmer really
wants to interview that we would just mean
[SPEAKER_03]: in a few thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But luckily for us, we have been able to
really narrow into the genetics of these
[SPEAKER_03]: traits completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I'm just showing some work from
our previous students, Dan Sweeney,
[SPEAKER_03]: who figured out specific base pairs with a
couple of our students that are causing
[SPEAKER_03]: this variation I just showed in the last
picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see that if the barley line has at
this specific location, so barley has a
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively big genome, millions of base
pair.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if this specific one base pair has A
and G there, it does have almost the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest, like as an example, number seven
score.
[SPEAKER_03]: As this N is like super non-tormant one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the barley line would have no A and
G there, and a T there, meaning it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: most super-tormant one, we see a
relatively massive difference between the
[SPEAKER_03]: sporadic ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that, so these are
actually the two genes here, and so these
[SPEAKER_03]: are the different specific base pairs that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just by measuring this in the lab,
or sending it out and having somebody else
[SPEAKER_03]: measure this in the lab, we could already
just, even without testing those lines out
[SPEAKER_03]: on the field, we could already see which
one has the trait that we are trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: select for and which one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm growing the populations out with a
naked barley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for working that out in the
public barley background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my approach right now is to take this
into the naked barley background and just
[SPEAKER_03]: to prove that this is also working in this
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can also have naked barley lines
that are suitable for New York and that
[SPEAKER_03]: would not sprout in the middle of July
when it's way too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where I want to conclude my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody has any more questions about
naked barley or whether to see if
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's interested, come ask me or June
Russell right here in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she could also help people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, here I'm just taking the chance
to thank everybody that has been helping
[SPEAKER_03]: me out, Barbara Kress and Carl Spoonzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our small rain lab, who's also right here,
David Bencher, Priscilla Thompson and
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason Schiller that have been a big help
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also all those collaborators from
different universities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have more questions or you just
want to check out our websites,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the one that tells more info about
the naked barley project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just more info about our small
rain project at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all for me and thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions, Priscilla?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned the pure variety here,
but you also mentioned the health benefit
[SPEAKER_06]: for the soil, including the health of
barley as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: The health benefit has been, if you look
at the picture related to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: increased medical gain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is related with the digestive system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it provides those more
complicated carbohydrates that are in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of rapid things like, how to say,
it improves the microbiome in the gut and
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, just make the system in the gut,
how to say, more stable.
