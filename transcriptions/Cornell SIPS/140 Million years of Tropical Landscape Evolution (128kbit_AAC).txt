[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a sabbatical two years ago,
I think three years ago, I forgot already,
[SPEAKER_06]: in New Haven.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have this big, do you think we
can turn the first row of light,
[SPEAKER_06]: please?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have this big snow storm, I think after
the hurricane Sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spent about three days trying to get
out of my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did my PhD in Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought I knew what winters were
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I go to New England and spend one
very long, long winter there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I send these photos to Camila and
Monica.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they told me, no, that's happening in
Ithaca every single day for a few months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I learned really that I love the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you are a plant biologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to tell you, but you are a
geologist.
[SPEAKER_06]: The diversity in the tropics sounds really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one hectare in Ecuador has more species
of trees than the entire continental USA.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a huge latitudinal gradient in
diversity from the tropics to temperate
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And STRI has been in Panama for almost 100
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, we put 100 years of research in
the tropics because we all there are very
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in understanding why there are
so many species in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to answer that question from
many different point of view because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not an easy question to answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, let's say what is a tropical,
neotropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what, during the next 50 minutes,
is what I will define as a tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a particular combination of climatic
parameters, floristic composition,
[SPEAKER_06]: forest structure, and plant fission.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm referring to a neotropical
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a climate, if the mineral precipitation
is above 1.8 meters a year, so it rains a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The mineral temperature is about 18
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: The floristics, if the forest is dominated
in abundance and diversity by certain
[SPEAKER_06]: families, plant families like Fabaceae,
Moraceae, Anoneaceae, Euphorbeaceae.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also by the forest structure, that the
forest is multi-stratified, so you have
[SPEAKER_06]: several layers of the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also that the top layer that is called
the canopy is closed and is dominated by
[SPEAKER_06]: angiosperm, by flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: By closed means that if you get,
this photo was taken from a canopy crane,
[SPEAKER_06]: something we have at STRI in Panama.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a capsule that you can go and
see the forest from above.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is something that is very hard to see
from the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go and see the forest from above,
you realize that every single space in
[SPEAKER_06]: this canopy is covered with a leaf,
because most of the light in the forest is
[SPEAKER_06]: trapped within the few meters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the trees, they really need to reach
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to do a lot of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also plant physiognomy, that the
leaves tend to be really large,
[SPEAKER_06]: and most of the leaves have an entire
margin, so a margin that is very smooth
[SPEAKER_06]: without edges, and also has a drip tip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I see this, characteristics is
what I will call a neotropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you want to track vegetation over
time, well, probably all your data will
[SPEAKER_06]: come from continental sequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And having a tool to be able to date the
continental rocks is very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, you will always be lost in
time, and you don't have for a minifera or
[SPEAKER_06]: nanoplanet to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: To do that, to solve that problem,
we use palynology.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a real example of a well drilled
by an oil company in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_06]: just before I joined this company,
like, 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just after I finished my PhD, I started
working for this oil company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a cross-section of the
foothills in Colombia, and this is the
[SPEAKER_06]: well they drilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see here, in the first
track they did, they drilled from here to
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over almost three months, they spent 20
meters of $20 million from here to here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, they were parallel to
the same bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they thought they were going across the
strata, but they were really along the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time profile, because they didn't
have a tool during the drilling to say,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, we are stuck in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to change the direction of the
drilling bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I joined this company, and over many
years, we used pollen as a tool to solve
[SPEAKER_06]: this problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the tropics, palynology has been
used for almost 60 years, because plant
[SPEAKER_06]: evolution is a fantastic tool to track
time over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we developed something that is called
biostratigraphics on Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went to many different sites in
Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we count a lot of pollen grains,
almost a million pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you realize I really love pollen
grains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many sites, many different samples.
[SPEAKER_06]: And based on all this information,
we developed biostratigraphics on Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is basically a hypothesis on plant
evolution, on when a particular species
[SPEAKER_06]: originate, when that particular species go
extinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for instance, this is an example of
one of the events in this on Asia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the extinction of this particular
species tell us that we are in 61.9
[SPEAKER_06]: million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: The advantage of working with oil
companies is that every time you do this
[SPEAKER_06]: biostratigraphics on Asia, you are testing
that hypothesis in the next drilling rig.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do a mistake, and you tell them
that you are in 65 when you are in 61,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they end in a different rock,
you know right away that your hypothesis
[SPEAKER_06]: was not correct, and you will have to find
a new job.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we developed a method called maximum.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used a maximum likelihood approach to
assess the probability of assigning an age
[SPEAKER_06]: to any given species.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, so instead of saying,
oh, this rock is late myosin, we say we
[SPEAKER_06]: use a probability bar, and it will tell us
the confidence we are on any given age for
[SPEAKER_06]: every particular sample.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, this sample here,
taking at 400 meters, has a probability of
[SPEAKER_06]: having this age with this probability bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are doing that for every sample we
make in our analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you also have to consider a climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this idea that the tropical plants
live very close to the optimal temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: has been really rooted in the literature
for many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very easy to understand why you
will say something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this graphic, we have mean annual
temperature here, and here mean annual
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every of these dots represent a
floristic plot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within the tropical belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see here, by changing the
precipitation, you can go from a tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest here in red, to a dry forest in
blue, to a savanna grassland, or to a
[SPEAKER_06]: desert here in green.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also you notice that you don't find
almost any tropical forest, no matter
[SPEAKER_06]: where you are, above 28 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may think, well, that's the optimal
for tropical plants today.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you search the temperatures of
the tropical land within the tropics,
[SPEAKER_06]: rented here by this red line, you will
realize that there is not really a place
[SPEAKER_06]: within the tropical belt that has a mean
annual temperature above 28, 28 point
[SPEAKER_06]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: So perhaps tropical plants cannot live
beyond 28 because there are not really
[SPEAKER_06]: many places in the tropics today with a
temperature higher of 28 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're a geologist, probably you
know this, have seen this many times.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it represents the proxy for the
temperature of the bottom of the ocean by
[SPEAKER_06]: measuring the delta O18 of foraminifera,
20 foraminifera, going back from zero to
[SPEAKER_06]: 120 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a very good proxy for global
temperature of the bottom of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be correlated to the ambient
temperature of the planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you compare today with most of
the last 120 million years, we realize
[SPEAKER_06]: that being in a cool planet is very rare
compared to most of the over the past 200
[SPEAKER_06]: million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most of the time, the planet had been
much warmer than today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for years, we have this dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We thought, well, perhaps the tropics are
very stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tropics work like a thermostat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no matter if the global planet is
warming or cooling, the temperature in the
[SPEAKER_06]: tropics will be always stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The poles get warmer or cooler,
but the tropics are always static.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because it's very stable climate,
that's the reason we have so many species
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, over the past 10 years, we have been
using different techniques to assess the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature of the tropics during past
global warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see here, we are using
plants, TEX86, a biomarker in a molecule
[SPEAKER_06]: in the ocean, isotopes on foraminifera.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these techniques, for instance,
is the snake body length of a snake that
[SPEAKER_06]: is called Titanoboa cerrejonensis that we
found in the Cerrejon formation about 60
[SPEAKER_06]: million years old in the northern part of
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for comparison, this is a modern boa
of four meters long.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this Titanoboa was about 45 to 50 feet
long, about one meter in diameter,
[SPEAKER_06]: and weighed about a ton, and was very
common in the Paleocene of the tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: forests of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today, if you measure how long a snake
is versus where do they live because they
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot control the internal temperature,
you will realize that there's a very good
[SPEAKER_06]: correlation between the length of the
snake and the minimum temperature of a
[SPEAKER_06]: place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we apply that to the fossil
record, we realize that the tropics were
[SPEAKER_06]: much warmer before than they are now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did this compilation of all the
empirical data we have on tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature for the past 120 million
years, about 9,000, 5,000, like 6,000 data
[SPEAKER_06]: points across the entire geological
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It spans from 125 to today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you will see that in the
mid-cretaceous, and this is just for the
[SPEAKER_06]: tropical belt, the temperature,
the min-annual temperature, were about
[SPEAKER_06]: seven degrees Celsius warmer than today.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the early Cenozoic, mostly during
the early Eocene, the temperature was
[SPEAKER_06]: about four point degrees Celsius warmer
than today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the graphic in the tropical belt will
look like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The temperature in the tropics has been
warmer than today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably you already know that the CO2
has been also much higher than it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time we have such low levels of
CO2, you will have to go back to the
[SPEAKER_06]: carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CO2 has been the constant, rather than
the high CO2 has been a constant on the
[SPEAKER_06]: planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's see the tropical fossil record.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we are going to divide this,
the block that follows in two different
[SPEAKER_06]: settings, one the Cretaceous and the other
the Cenozoic, because the flora in the
[SPEAKER_06]: tropical belt are really fundamentally
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I call the Cretaceous a
non-angiosperm tropical world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know from the pollen record that the
oldest angiosperm don't have any
[SPEAKER_06]: geographical pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we find them both in high latitudes,
mid latitudes, and low latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still don't know really where the
oldest angiosperm, the belt, the
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes, the latitudinal belt that the
oldest angiosperm originate.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the oldest fossils are very tiny
plants like Archaeofructus, leafructus
[SPEAKER_06]: from China.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this paper was published about 20
years ago by Ligdell and Peter Crane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he compiled all the literature we have
about all the plants within the
[SPEAKER_06]: Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he produced this graphic that has been
used many, many times, showing how the
[SPEAKER_06]: angiosperm were very few at the beginning
of the Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the end of the Cretaceous,
the angiosperm dominate the flora.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you see all the data points he used
for scene analysis, you will realize that
[SPEAKER_06]: this is age, and this is paleolatitude of
macroflora and pollen flora, that most of
[SPEAKER_06]: the data he used came from temperate
regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't have, at this time, any public
locality within the tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the entire Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the samples for the pollen
were done by a stratigraph, always just
[SPEAKER_06]: focusing a few markers that were used by
all companies, especially in Nigeria and
[SPEAKER_06]: Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now when you look at the phylogenists,
so botanists, they take all the plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: they analyze DNA and produce these
phylogenists where you express the
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship among taxa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of the phylogenists and the new
phylogenists are confirming this.
[SPEAKER_06]: That most of the orders of the angiosperm
were evolved by the Cenomanian,
[SPEAKER_06]: about 100 million years, 90 to 100 million
years ago, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this led us to publish this paper 10
years ago with Chuck Davis from the
[SPEAKER_06]: University of Harvard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saying, well, we have all these families
and orders backing the mid Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, you will expect to find a
modern tropical plant or a tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest similar to what we call today a
tropical rainforest back in the mid
[SPEAKER_06]: Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we published this paper in American
Naturalist.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at this time, I have very little
empirical record from tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And over the past 10 years, we have been
working very hard on assessing the record,
[SPEAKER_06]: and now I think we were totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't see that in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go back 136 million years,
and to eastern Colombia, this beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: flora called San Felix, not a single
angiosperm.
[SPEAKER_06]: We move up in time to the Aptian Aldian.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, the angiosperm in abundance are
very, very, very little, about only 2% of
[SPEAKER_06]: the entire Palino flora when you do
countings of the different elements of the
[SPEAKER_06]: flora.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go into the middle Cenomanian with all
the phylogenists are saying, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the angiosperm are already,
the orders are already there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, the angiosperm represent just a
small percentage of the abundant
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution of the flores.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even more that the latitudinal gradient in
the early Cretaceous is either flat or
[SPEAKER_06]: inverted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you compare the diversity from
temporal latitude to the tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: latitude, the high gradient we see today
is not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, let's move to the end of the
Cretaceous, to the Maastrichtian.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been working on these coal
mines in close to Bogota.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this guy goes down in these mines about
300 meters, and you can see all the fossil
[SPEAKER_06]: plants in the roofs of the coal mines.
[SPEAKER_06]: But something very striking about this
flora is that the typical components of
[SPEAKER_06]: the modern tropical forest has many ponds
and many families of taxa that we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have any idea what are they.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we compare the floristic composition
of this Maastrichtian flora with today's
[SPEAKER_06]: most common elements, most common families
in tropical forest here represent by these
[SPEAKER_06]: gray bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in red, we have the families we find
in the Maastrichtian flora.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see that this Maastrichtian flora
is not really floristically, a tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a forest that lives in the tropics,
but it's very different from the forest we
[SPEAKER_06]: have today in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you go back to the Cretaceous-Tersary
boundary.
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably all have heard about the
meteorite strike the Yucatan Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at the pollen record in
tropical latitudes in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially, we have been working on a few
cores.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these is called Diablito,
where you can, with pollen, you can get to
[SPEAKER_06]: a very fine stratigraphic resolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you look at the pollen, the diversity
of the pollen, going from 70 million to 62
[SPEAKER_06]: million.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, we saw a big sharp decrease in
the diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And about 75% of all the species that were
in the Maastrichtian go extinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this level is also represent a
fundamental change in the abundant
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution of the flora.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went from a flora where only 50% were
angiosperms, to a flora that is already
[SPEAKER_06]: fully dominated by angiosperms in the
Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only that, but when you look at the
abundant distribution of the seeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: fruits, you will see that in the
Maastrichtian flora, all these fruits or
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds are very tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: While in the Paleocene, you have a wide
distribution from the small seed to big
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds of fruit that you can see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this event, the
Cretaceous-Tersary, event changed
[SPEAKER_06]: fundamentally the structure and
composition of the tropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went from a forest where the canopy
probably was open and dominated by
[SPEAKER_06]: gymnosperms, at Aucarius probably,
to the closed canopy dominated by
[SPEAKER_06]: angiosperms we know today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can look also at the venation density
in the fossil leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are close-ups of fossil leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, we can see the very
fine venation of the leaves back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Paleocene or the Maastrichtian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you go today to a rainforest and
you measure the venation density of all
[SPEAKER_06]: the leaves from the bottom of the forest
to the top of the forest, you will see
[SPEAKER_06]: that there is a strong bimodal
distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the canopy, you have a very high
venation density.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the understory, you have low
venation density.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably, you could explain that
because, well, if you are here in the
[SPEAKER_06]: canopy, you want to maximize the amount of
photosynthesis you want to do because you
[SPEAKER_06]: are exposed to the light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are in the lower level where
the light is very diminished, you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: spend so much energy having a lot of vein
because you cannot do a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can see that this closed canopy
will give you this bimodal distribution of
[SPEAKER_06]: the forest today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see that in the litter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go underneath the forest and you
collect the leaves in the litter,
[SPEAKER_06]: you will see the same bimodal distribution
that you see represented in the forest
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We compare the venation density of many
different flora within the tropics and
[SPEAKER_06]: temperate latitude from the Outer Rivian
to the Paleocene, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And only until the Paleocene, we see this
bimodal distribution that is typical of
[SPEAKER_06]: modern tropical rainforest represented
here in black, compared to all the
[SPEAKER_06]: different distribution we see during the
Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We think this is an evidence that not only
the florescent composition changed,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also the structure of the forest
itself changed as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this change, I think, not only
affected the forest itself, but also the
[SPEAKER_06]: climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Camila told me that Kevin Boyce
came here a few months ago to give a
[SPEAKER_06]: seminar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kevin did this beautiful study where
he did a climatic modeling of the
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazonia.
[SPEAKER_06]: But instead of having angiosperms,
he put gymnosperms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because the gymnosperms have a very
low venation density, the leaves are
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller, the evapotranspiration or the
photosynthesis they do is lower than the
[SPEAKER_06]: angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he run this climatic modeling,
and the results were really staggering.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just by changing the forest from
angiosperm to gymnosperm, the temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: represented here by the precipitation
represented here by the blue of the
[SPEAKER_06]: gymnosperm, no, by the yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gymnosperm, the precipitation dropped
by 35%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the temperature increased by three
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the length of the dry season increased
by two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having a gymnosperm forest there made
the tropics warmer and drier, just because
[SPEAKER_06]: the effect of the transpiration of the
leaves had on the climate itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: About half of the rainfall that happened
in the tropics today comes from the
[SPEAKER_06]: transpiration of the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the lessons, I think we can learn from
the cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the end of the cretaceous,
the angiosperms lack biomass dominance and
[SPEAKER_06]: did not rule most of the landscape in the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though they were diversified,
it doesn't transfer that into ecological
[SPEAKER_06]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably there were a lot of shrubs
and herbaceous and mostly common in flora
and fauna.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a fantastic example of
how morphological innovation, all these
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristics that make an angiosperm an
angiosperm, lacks ecological success by at
[SPEAKER_06]: least 55 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the change in landscape occupancy
lead to a change in tropical climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's go to the second chapter in the
entire Cenozoic, where we see a canopy
[SPEAKER_06]: that is already dominated by angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to show you one of the
oldest tropical rainforests, as I define
[SPEAKER_06]: it, that we know today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's from Cerrejon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to keep in mind, the Cerrejon is
within the precipitation rate of modern
[SPEAKER_06]: tropical rainforests, but the temperature
was about a degree and a half warmer than
[SPEAKER_06]: any tropical rainforest today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we think that this
rainforest looked like with the giant
[SPEAKER_06]: snakes and huge massive crocodiles and big
turtles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have been studying this in the
Cerrejon coal mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the biggest open pit coal mine
in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year they remove the same amount of
material that was removed to construct the
[SPEAKER_06]: Panama Canal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mine has been operating for almost
35 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It produces about 30 million tons of coal
per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to give you a sense of the size of
this mine, there are about seven pits like
[SPEAKER_06]: this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this here, this tiny dot here,
is one of these, if you have been in a
[SPEAKER_06]: coal mine, one of these huge trucks that
people in the mining industry use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it allows us an amazing opportunity to
look for fossils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just a collage of many of the
typical plants we find in the Cerrejon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have legumes, many other fossils.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as we did with the Mastrician,
when you compare the Cerrejon,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Paleocene, and in red, the families we
find in the fossil record there with the
[SPEAKER_06]: modern families today, you see that
floristically, Cerrejon is already a
[SPEAKER_06]: neotropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I told you, we have this, not only the
forest, the biomass was very large,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also the animal seems to be really
huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did this model of Titanoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my son.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, he has a very long hair,
and I haven't been able for him to cut the
[SPEAKER_06]: hair because he said that I'm yellow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this model has been traveling for the
past two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's a museum, I think, in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was done by an artist in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Cerrejon also show us that the
families that dominate the rainforest in
[SPEAKER_06]: the Paleocene are still dominating the
extent of the neotropical rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when you move from the Paleocene up
in time, you will find this called the
[SPEAKER_06]: PETM, the Paleocene Eocene Thermal
Maximum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a unique interval in our
history that people have been studying all
[SPEAKER_06]: over the world for many years because it's
probably the closest analog to the warming
[SPEAKER_06]: we are having today.
[SPEAKER_06]: The temperature went up by five to seven
degrees Celsius in 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even though probably the fastest in
the geological record is about 10 times
[SPEAKER_06]: lower to what is happening nowadays.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see all the climate models that
have been done to be able to reproduce the
[SPEAKER_06]: PETM, the only way to reach the
temperature of high latitudes to the
[SPEAKER_06]: empirical levels that we know happened
during the PETM is pumping a lot of CO2 in
[SPEAKER_06]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this particular model, Haber and
Caballero, they had to go to 4,500 PPMs of
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, today we are in 402 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way you can reach the
temperature that we find in the high
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when that happened, you see here in
South America, they proposed that you just
[SPEAKER_06]: have a dead zone in the tropics because
the temperature will reach beyond 45
[SPEAKER_06]: degrees Celsius of mean annual
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it means that during middle of the day,
the temperature can go up to 90 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been now because the PETM is
only 10,000 years is the beginning and the
[SPEAKER_06]: warming and then 190,000 years for the
cooling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the whole interval is only 200,000
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in rock, that could be represented by
only one meter or two meters depending on
[SPEAKER_06]: sedimentation rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we spend many, many years, almost 15
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I look for many different sections all
over Colombia and Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, we find three sites where we
were absolutely sure that the PETM was
[SPEAKER_06]: located.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those we have to go with a
helicopter and the Colombian army likes
[SPEAKER_06]: geology so much that they went with us to
collect in this particular site.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the three sites.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here, this block represent the PETM.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in green are the taxa that are present
in both.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is Poland in the three panels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, we found the opposite
to what we were expecting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were expecting high levels of
extinction during the PETM and very low
[SPEAKER_06]: levels of origination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we saw was just the opposite,
that there is a huge spike in the
[SPEAKER_06]: origination rate in the PETM.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the levels of extinction are very low.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we calculate the per capita
origination or extinction rate,
[SPEAKER_06]: we see that during the PETM, the
origination went up, not on high
[SPEAKER_06]: extinction as we anticipated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when you look at the many different
phylogenies of different plant groups,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the orchids or the pythitic farms,
even the original form of art agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is very tricky on the dating
itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But many of them seems to show that during
the early years, something is really
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, that also begs the question that
probably this climate model is not
[SPEAKER_06]: correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it would be very hard to explain
how can a plant live at a mean annual
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature of 50 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's almost at the physical limit of
many of those plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it means that we don't have a very good
way to reproduce the climate during global
[SPEAKER_06]: warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something missing in the climate
system that we don't understand,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is amplifying the warming in the
poles while maintaining and also
[SPEAKER_06]: increasing the temperature in the equator,
but not at a high degree as we see that in
[SPEAKER_06]: the poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something, something really
missing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps the CO2 sensitivity is larger than
three degrees Celsius as we have been
[SPEAKER_06]: assuming for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we continue up in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will see during the entire Paleocene,
Eocene, Oligocene and Myocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is once again the temperature of
the bottom of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you move in this direction,
it's warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you move in the direction, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the plant diversity of the
northern neotropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look through the pollen record.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, there is a good
correlation between the long-term trends
[SPEAKER_06]: in warming and the increase in diversity
and the long-term trends in cooling and
[SPEAKER_06]: the drop in diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we see that happen in a very short
time scale, like the PTM, and a long time
[SPEAKER_06]: scale during the cenocycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it seems like every few weeks there
is a new paper in Nature and Science
[SPEAKER_06]: anticipating the collapse of all the
ecosystems in the tropics because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: current global warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, there are many bad things that
happen to plants when you increase the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the net production decreased due to
increased respiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: The photosynthesis slowed down.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many bad things, a lot of leaf
stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how come this, we anticipate that the
plants will not function very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The temperature is very high, but the
deposit records show the opposite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, really, the temperature of the leaf
is controlled mostly by the temperature of
[SPEAKER_06]: the air, the CO2, and the moisture in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we go back to the Paleocene,
for instance, we always see high levels of
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: And high levels of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can assess rainfall by looking at the
leaf area.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bigger the area of the fossil leaves,
the bigger the precipitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can assess the precipitation of a
given flora.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this case, the sarahum was 3.4 meters
of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are many experiments have shown
that the photosynthesis of the plant can
[SPEAKER_06]: do a better photosynthesis at a higher
temperature when the CO2 are higher,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if the precipitation elevate
the negative effect of the warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this experiment, we do with the Cloud
Winton Ecophysiology at the Strait,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we put all these plants in enclosure
with the CO2 was double of the amounts
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here in black is the experiment with
the elevated CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: In gray is the experiment with the CO2 we
have today.
[SPEAKER_06]: In all of the cases, the plant water users
efficiency increases as the CO2 goes up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just the proportion of the
water that the plant uses versus the
[SPEAKER_06]: proportion of the water that the plant
loses in the photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_06]: evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it means that when you have a lot of
CO2, the plants don't need to use as much
[SPEAKER_06]: water as they used before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And perhaps even though the temperature
goes up, as the CO2 goes up, they don't
[SPEAKER_06]: need to be exposed to the high
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need to be exposed to the high
temperature as today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, also when you increase the
temperature, you may think, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps as the temperature expands toward
the temperature latitude, the tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest here represented here in this
green color would expand toward higher
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do that for the Eocene and you use
the temperature gradient we have today and
[SPEAKER_06]: the temperature gradient we have in the
Paleocene, you will see that by increasing
[SPEAKER_06]: the temperature during the early Eocene
warming, you will find 18 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the temperature I told you was the
boundary, lower boundary is tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will find that temperature down in
Patagonia in both cases.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would expect for the tropical
rainforest to expand to where the tropical
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, these are many hypotheses on
biomevolution during the early Eocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: The green in the rainforest, and as you
see, many people have predicted that the
[SPEAKER_06]: rainforest will expand toward Patagonia
high latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Others say, no, perhaps you will have a
very dry area during this sensoid warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the analysis of comparing many of
the fossil record we have here with many
[SPEAKER_06]: of the fossil record in Chile and
Argentina.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we realized that the tropical
rainforest don't expand toward high
[SPEAKER_06]: latitudes during global warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we see is the development of a new
biome that paleontologists in Argentina
[SPEAKER_06]: call the mixed paleoflora, Romero.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Romero published this about in 1978,
and he already gave us the answer 40 years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago, that really the tropics don't expand
toward high latitudes during global
[SPEAKER_06]: warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we see is the evolution of a new
biome adapted to temperate areas during
[SPEAKER_06]: winter that are not so cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you see a very distinctive,
abundant distribution in the most
[SPEAKER_06]: important families between the fossil
record of the neotropics in the Eocene
[SPEAKER_06]: versus the lower latitudes in South
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the Eocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this sensoid fossil record show us that
the temperature correlates with the
[SPEAKER_06]: diversity alone on short time scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: That probably tropical plant families
already have the genetic variability to
[SPEAKER_06]: cope with high temperature and high CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a strong niche conservative.
[SPEAKER_06]: As it happened to me living in New England
during the winter, you are living in the
[SPEAKER_06]: tropics, very hard to move to high
latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably the CO2 climate sensitivity
is larger than three degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going to show you the last chapter
of this story.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the birth of a new ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The savannas.
[SPEAKER_06]: In orange is the distribution of modern
savannas today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really depend on savannas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of our agriculture and most of the
people live in savannas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's much easier to live in a
savanna than in a place where it's raining
[SPEAKER_06]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can explain why we have dry zones
today just by the atmospheric circulation
[SPEAKER_06]: of our planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will always find dry zones in the
subtropics because of the difference along
[SPEAKER_06]: the equator and high latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And indeed many people I showed you before
has shown that they were savannas or
grasslands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the early years.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when you look at the plant
phylogenies of many of the most important
[SPEAKER_06]: families that live in savannas or
therapeutic environments today,
[SPEAKER_06]: you will see that most of them indeed show
originations back in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the actual radiation happened within
the last 10 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's very interesting on why you
would expect to find always dry zone back
[SPEAKER_06]: in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why you only see this big radiation
happening within the last 10 million
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have been studying the empirical
record of these dry areas over the past
[SPEAKER_06]: few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these is called Castilletes here in
northern part of Colombia that today is
[SPEAKER_06]: basically a desert.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful place we have been collecting
there for many years.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Camila Martinez here collecting
years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you will see these huge sand
dunes and there is a massive called the
[SPEAKER_06]: Maquira mountain that is in the middle of
the desert with cloud forest and rain
[SPEAKER_06]: forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an island among this big,
big desert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the desert itself we find a lot of
fossils like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the skull of a gavial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or this astrapotherium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the tusks.
[SPEAKER_06]: This animal that looks like a kind of a
hypopotamus.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from South American origin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you clean the fossil that will look
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you have gavials like this
skull.
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember they are coming from this
very dry desert today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many species of Pulusaurus is one of the
biggest crocodile that ever existed and
[SPEAKER_06]: was very common all over the neotropic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This animal couldn't fit in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: And was very common in Guajira at that
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You find a lot of giant armadillos,
capybaras.
[SPEAKER_06]: These very large freshwater turtles like
the stupendemis.
[SPEAKER_06]: See the size of these guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get a sense of the size of
these freshwater turtles that are related
[SPEAKER_06]: to the Charapas that they live in the
Orinoco but they are about this size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you find these giant guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are about 700 kilos, two meter tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are a very productive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is how we think the Castilletes
looked three million years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Permanent rivers, a lot of biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is how Castilletes looks today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also, when looking into the Yanos of
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: The savannas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you haven't been in the savannas.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing, beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see all these grasslands and you only
see trees along the water causeways.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is a place difficult to study
because there are no outcrops.
[SPEAKER_06]: But an oil company drilled a core.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these places and we were able to
study the entire core.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the pollen record of the
grasses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the geological time going from
23 million years to today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see even, over the up to
five million years, you don't see any
[SPEAKER_06]: evidence of grasslands in the Yanos of
Colombia today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably the savannas also evolved or
expand during the last three or four
[SPEAKER_06]: million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if you think about the expansion of
all these dry lands here and also all the
[SPEAKER_06]: cerrados.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an area that used to be occupied
by tropical rainforests.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now today we don't have that there is a
very good relationship between area and
[SPEAKER_06]: the number of species.
[SPEAKER_06]: The larger the area, the higher the number
of species.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of increasing the area,
you decrease the area of an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would predict a large extinction
across many different planes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if you look at the phylogeny of
many of plant families today in Amazonia,
[SPEAKER_06]: there must be a significant reduction in
diversity over the past five million
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably because in the DNA,
if you look at phylogeny, it's very hard
[SPEAKER_06]: to look at a phylogeny if something
doesn't exist today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So probably there's a fundamental bias in
the way we analyze phylogenetic data to
[SPEAKER_06]: assess the past diversity that we don't
understand very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would expect that the diversity in
the Amazonia has dropped over the past
[SPEAKER_06]: five million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now,
[SPEAKER_06]: I always thought that the Pliocene was
really boring, that nothing really
[SPEAKER_06]: happened there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But over the last years, I realized how
really critical the mid-Pliocene was and
[SPEAKER_06]: really changed the climate, the state of
our planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you look at the temporal record from 60
million years to today, you see that
[SPEAKER_06]: around 3 to 2.7, you see a fundamental
difference and a fundamental change in
[SPEAKER_06]: this term of very warm climate to what we
see today, this oscillation of warming and
[SPEAKER_06]: cooling since the glaciation started 2.7
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also that the CO2 has been changing
over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least during the glaciation,
interglaciation, we have been going from
[SPEAKER_06]: 180 parts per million to 280 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are in 402 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could summarize this climate state
what we are now today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a conjunction of four factors that we
have not seen at least for 400 million
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is that we have very steep
latitudinal temperate gradient from the
[SPEAKER_06]: equator to the pole.
[SPEAKER_06]: That today is about 50 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go from 27 Celsius in the tropics
to minus 20 in the poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go back to the EOS, you see it was
32 to 14.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the increase in the temperature
gradient is the strongest we have seen in
[SPEAKER_06]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second point is that we have a strong
temperature gradient between the eastern
[SPEAKER_06]: Pacific and the western Pacific.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something we haven't had in a very,
very long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference in temperature from the sea
here in front of Australia to the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature of the ocean here in front of
Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_06]: The third, the first time we have ice in
the poles, permanent ice in both poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first time in a long, long time
that the CO2 has dropped below 200 parts
[SPEAKER_06]: per million.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today not a single climatic model has
been able to have these four elements in
[SPEAKER_06]: their modeling to reproduce of the climate
of the early Pleiades.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is something is still missing out
of the climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we know that what controls at a very
large degree the different ecosystem
[SPEAKER_06]: within the tropics is not really the
temperature, but precipitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: How the amount of rainfall and the length
of the dry seas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that very easy if you go
to Guajira.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is during La Niña event in 2011 when
a lot of precipitation was brought here to
[SPEAKER_06]: the northern part of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is El Niño when precipitation
drops.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are changes that happen within
three or four months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And green is the vegetation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how you go from a really desert to
very low grassland only by changing the
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation within a single year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now within the tropics, what controls most
of the precipitation is the intertropical
[SPEAKER_06]: convergence zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this low humid, low pressure belt that
is moving all the time along the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you have winter in the southern,
the ITCC is always moving away from the
[SPEAKER_06]: hemisphere that is the coldest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So during the winter in the northern,
in the southern hemisphere, the ITCC move
[SPEAKER_06]: north.
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the winter in North America,
the ITCC moves south.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you are here, for instance,
you will always have rain because the belt
[SPEAKER_06]: goes up and down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you are here, for instance,
during the winter here, you will get the
[SPEAKER_06]: rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: During the winter here, you get the dry
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what brings the rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, but that works when you have ice in
both poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still don't know what happened very
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the ice is only one pole in the south,
in the north, or we don't have ice in any
[SPEAKER_06]: of the poles.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know if, for instance,
we don't have ice here or here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the ITCC gets wider and doesn't move
very much or the precipitation increase
[SPEAKER_06]: all along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with very, very few empirical data
about precipitation, that is really the
[SPEAKER_06]: key factor here rather than temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the final conclusion of this last
chapter is that this is another example of
[SPEAKER_06]: how morphological innovation, the fact of
you being a grass, ecological success by
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we see all these lineages evolving back
in the Eocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you only see a large diversification
and the occupancy of landscape within the
[SPEAKER_06]: last 10 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also predict a large reduction in
tropical forest coverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also that most climate models fail to
predict the lack of extensive savannas
[SPEAKER_06]: during global warming intervals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think just to summarize everything I
told you, we produced this movie of the
[SPEAKER_06]: biomes over the past 55 million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So each color represents a particular
biome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have been using G plates to assess
the biomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll start in 55 million years and
we'll end today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in green forest, the black here,
the tropical rainforest from the North
[SPEAKER_06]: American latitudes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It went very fast, no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just to end.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you see that the funding for
geological science has been dropping at
[SPEAKER_06]: least in NSF in Colombia and many places
in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you realize that over the past
150 years, we went from 280 parts per
[SPEAKER_06]: million to 402 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you go back to the last glaciation,
20,000 years ago, we went from 180 to 280.
[SPEAKER_06]: So only 100 parts per million in 20,000
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we have been going up about 130 parts
per million in only 150 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that 402 is very close to the levels
of CO2 back in the Pliocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the last time we have a CO2 like we
have it today, you have to go back five
[SPEAKER_06]: million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: You realize that we are really in a
massive global explosion of experiments to
[SPEAKER_06]: reproduce a climate of the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably geology and I think what we
do, the Pelioclimate and the
[SPEAKER_06]: reconstruction of ancient ecosystems is
really critical to understand and predict
[SPEAKER_06]: what is going to happen because all the
historical records that people is using to
[SPEAKER_06]: build climatic models or do experiments
are based on historical records.
[SPEAKER_06]: And none of the historical records human
had by looking at the temperature and
[SPEAKER_06]: precipitation over the past 200 years has
had levels of CO2 similar to what we have
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to go back to your
geological record to reproduce what will
[SPEAKER_06]: be happening and is already happening over
the next decades to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to give you a sense of that,
this is an experiment that has been
[SPEAKER_06]: running in front of my building.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have these two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this greenhouse, we have the CO2 as
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ambient conditions, 402 parts per
million in this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in here, we are trying to replicate
280 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the CO2 we have 150 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has been a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have here a very large column full
with calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a sensor of CO2 here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every time the CO2 goes above 280,
we suck the air between this capsule and
[SPEAKER_06]: the CO2 combined.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that drops down the CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we have here is corn,
CMAs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are assessing how fast the CMAs,
the corn can grow in different CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you already see how the CO2,
the corn in the high CO2, the CO2 of today
[SPEAKER_06]: is growing really, really fast compared to
the CO2 150 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are spending a lot of funding just
to replicate how the climate was 150 years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one of the clues is going to
the field today, study the fossil record
[SPEAKER_06]: of the tropics that is mostly unexplored.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes you find these big trees at
4,000 meters of elevation in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Altiplano, in the Peruvian Andes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was struck by the comparison of the
models of the Paleocene-Eocene climate
[SPEAKER_08]: maximum that was between these 45 to 50
degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you were comparing it with what you
saw on the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a way for you to actually
calibrate those models by telling people
[SPEAKER_08]: how hot it really was, ambient-wise,
from the fossil record?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have empirical determination we
have from temperature are about 32 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this just compounds the problem,
because you have to reach the temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: of the almost close to the bone to 14
degrees Celsius without increasing the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature in the tropics in your 32
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what combination you do of heat,
ocean transfer, there is a fundamental
[SPEAKER_06]: component of the climate that we don't
understand, and that's the reason we are
[SPEAKER_06]: not able to replicate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not able to replicate even the
early Paleocene climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is just a small example of the
climate back in the early Eocene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you see all the predictions we do
for the future, they are based on the
[SPEAKER_06]: historical record.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have this CO2 we don't have data
about that we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are so many models I have predicted
that around 450 years of CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have a climate state change.
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, you could transform a
savanna into a rainforest, into a canopy
[SPEAKER_06]: forest, because the CO2 is much higher
than before.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not a gradual change,
but a threshold change.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have one system and then you have
the next system, and the change is really,
[SPEAKER_06]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are approaching to that,
so I hope before I die, I'll see the CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: at 450 and we'll be able to, if I was
correct, looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand savanna.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason that we would have the
savanna climate situation developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a climate change model.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't controlled by the biologically
available grass spread into a new system
[SPEAKER_01]: because of climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you saying that the boundaries of
the topics shrunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think you need to first need to
change the climate by increasing the
[SPEAKER_06]: length of the dry season.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you expand the landscape and then the
grasses as the area increases,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a ravage.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the grasses have been there for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the problem is to explain the
absence of extensive savannas back in
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why during the early years, even though
you have these workers in place,
[SPEAKER_06]: why we don't have extensive savannas back
in the fossil record?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible that the battle
transpiration of faster turnover,
[SPEAKER_04]: precipitation, rainfall, keep the tropics
cooler than they otherwise might be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think the key is see this water,
it's only moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Klaus has experiments of five
degrees, growing at 45 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you put enough water, the plants,
okay, but this is a controlled experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a point that... But not so much
the survival of the plants, but actually
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing the deflux in the upper
atmosphere or in the space by having a
[SPEAKER_04]: phase change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, at least in the PTM, we think that
the biomass increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't see an increase in the... We
see an improvement in the water use
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that extra water that the plant is not
using, it could be used to produce more
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass or could go back to the atmosphere
and from clouds and perhaps depending on
[SPEAKER_06]: the elevation of the cloud, you can go
from cooling to warming.
[SPEAKER_06]: The clouds are very tricky, but it could
be another factor that is letting the
[SPEAKER_06]: tropics cool while the whole planet is
warming up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still the difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a large degree of temperature
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to raise the temperature in the
pole, but at the same time maintaining the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just warming five degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other is like 15, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mixed creative community was the
historical state when you had high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature by CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those taxa still extant and
restricted?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you predict that they would
expand again in a similar regime in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are they all extant and we need to
start over so it doesn't run into a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: new things?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think you go to Chiloé.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the remnants of this mixed
policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just very restricted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we don't have a temperate area,
we have decent winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a winter not too winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see a possibility for rising CO2
and potentially rising precipitation,
[SPEAKER_05]: the recognition that we need to...
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's really the critical part of
the deforestation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even though we're increasing the
CO2, the amount of forest forests have
[SPEAKER_06]: been increasing like crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been living in Panama for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Darien is this region in the border
between Colombia and Panama.
[SPEAKER_06]: And 10 years ago, you could go to Darien,
that is only two hours away from Panama
[SPEAKER_06]: City.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the whole thing would be covered with
forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go today, and it's just one to cry
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the forest is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is not really this cooling effect
of a bad precipitation because the forest
[SPEAKER_06]: is not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Brazil, to Bonito, a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have this meeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Pantanal, beautiful forest,
what used to be a forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you go there because the soil price
has been going up because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: don't sow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This extensive area that used to be this
Pantanal forest now are converted into
[SPEAKER_06]: soil fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fields that you cannot see in the end
of the fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are transformed within the last
10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So investors from all over the world to
fund these hedge funds have been buying
[SPEAKER_06]: soil to transform the landscape at a rate
that is just unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all this cooling effect is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have the extra CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would seem that the only mechanism
you have is pretty high CO2 to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to have a pretty permanent cloud
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any paleo indicator for light
level that might tell you that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: really had permanent cloud cover that you
could pick out in some way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's any physiological
characteristic that is related to that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the understory is always going
to be dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see anything in the canopy that
might say, geez, there wasn't as many
[SPEAKER_00]: photons?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that's the only possibility
we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been thinking about that for a
few years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're still having to find a proxy to
measure the cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have thinking for some experience that
they will tell you in the cuticles of the
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the signals, yeah, we still need to do
a lot of empirical work in the forest
[SPEAKER_06]: today to understand the relationship
between the ethereum in the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_06]: cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the clouds, we don't have any data
on cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's something that even today is a
mystery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but that's a critical component of
the response to the cloud cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: In previous warnings that you showed,
there was a pretty speciation outpaced
[SPEAKER_03]: extinction pretty dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this were to happen again,
would you kind of predict the same ratio?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or would you predict a human with
influence?
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is the scale of the changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here, once again, we increased 150
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And over the past 20,000 years,
we only increased the CO2 100 parts per
[SPEAKER_06]: million.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rates are so, we never had such an
incredible rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very hard to tell what the
populations are going to do, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: with the high levels of deforestation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't predict that in Asia,
because most of the species will be wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end, our species is only
140,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from the fossil record, we know that
any even species on average lasts three
[SPEAKER_06]: million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, if you are a very small animal,
big animal, small planet, an average of
[SPEAKER_06]: three million years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been, here, only a small
fraction, 5% of the typical duration of a
[SPEAKER_06]: species.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't imagine the humans here in
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even a thousand years for me, we are
already seven million.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look at the fossil record over
the past 3.5 billion years, there have
[SPEAKER_06]: been a lot of mass extinction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably in hours, we'll go extinct,
we'll take a lot of species with us,
[SPEAKER_06]: and even geologists come around,
another planet, look at our fossil record,
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll just be a blink in the geological
history, and life will come back again
[SPEAKER_06]: with different rules, but we'll be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least if you are a geologist,
that's a fantastic experiment,
[SPEAKER_06]: because we are living in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Society did a geology so important that
they decided to invest seven million
[SPEAKER_06]: people to create an environment that
didn't have a president.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a geological perspective
to appreciate this.
Well, perhaps on that note, we should
thank again Carlos for a brilliant
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
