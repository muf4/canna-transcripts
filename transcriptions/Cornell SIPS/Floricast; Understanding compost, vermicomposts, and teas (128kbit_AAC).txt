University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to this Floracast episode on
understanding compost, vermicompost,
[SPEAKER_00]: and teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this Floracast is to
introduce the listener to several key
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts related to using compost,
vermicompost, teas, and extracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as to describe their use in
certified organic production systems in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composts are simply organic matter that
has been subjected to decomposition in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost can be useful in substrate
production because they can be a source of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, for example for suppressing
root-borne diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composts have a high cation exchange or
nutrient holding capacity, and the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: itself can be a slow-release nutrient
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: In container production, mature compost
should always be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immature compost can be high in ammonia
and volatile organic compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be damaging to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certified organic greenhouse
production, compost are allowed according
[SPEAKER_00]: to the National Organic Program NOP
guidelines, so long as the following
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria are met.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compost should use approved
feedstocks, which include many plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: animal materials that are not contaminated
with prohibited substances, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimum temperature requirements must be
met during the composting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing when using compost in container
production are that all composts are not
[SPEAKER_00]: created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, one cannot assume that all
composts can be used in container
[SPEAKER_00]: production, and it is important for a
grower to test different compost sources
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as batches to ensure that the
material is suitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of compost using the
sausage analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, all sausages are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sausages will have different feedstocks or
meat products used in making them,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as different curing processes,
and ultimately that's going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you have an Oscar Mayer wiener or
a very nice Polska kielbasa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some steps that you can check to
make sure that your compost is suitable
[SPEAKER_00]: for container production, and I do
recommend that you test each batch from a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier to ensure its suitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to talk about
vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simply, vermicompost can be thought
of as worm-worked waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms will digest and fragment the
feedstock into finely divided materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermicompost is not just the poop or the
castings from worms, but also the other
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter that the worms have divided
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermicompost can be a useful material
because it is finely divided, it is
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains more soluble nitrogen,
phosphorus, and potassium than a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of vermicomposting that's done
on an industrial scale is available at
[SPEAKER_00]: Wormpower LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process, the manure solids from a
dairy operation are collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: These solids are then brought into a
warehouse where they are thermophilically
[SPEAKER_00]: composted in static piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This then serves as the feedstock for the
final step, which is feeding this material
[SPEAKER_00]: to millions of red wiggler earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the National Organic Program
guidelines, vermicompost is allowed in
[SPEAKER_00]: certified organic production so long as
the following guidelines are met.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vermicompost material should again be
made from allowed feedstock materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the duration of the vermicomposting
process should be 6 to 12 months for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor windrows, 2 to 4 months for indoor
container systems, 2 to 4 months for
[SPEAKER_00]: angled wedge systems, and 30 to 60 days
for continuous flow reactors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to talk about compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas are liquids that are made by
brewing or steeping compost in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process serves to transfer microbes,
fine particulate organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and soluble chemical components,
such as plant-available nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the compost to the liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits of compost tea are that it
contains some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, compost teas can contain a
beneficial microbial community,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might be used for the control of
foliar and root diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: These microbes might also be involved in
enhancing nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers may question whether or not
compost teas work, and the answer again is
[SPEAKER_00]: it all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Returning to the sausage analogy,
compost teas can be prepared in many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways, and they can also have
many different feedstocks and additives
[SPEAKER_00]: that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not you get a beneficial
microbial community as an end result will
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on all of the processes that take
place up to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things to decide when preparing
compost teas is whether or not to actively
[SPEAKER_00]: aerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tea is what we call the material when we
do use this active process to add air or
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen during brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done to promote the population of
aerobic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We refer to the material as an extract
when a passive process is followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, oxygen is not introduced during
the steeping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be referred to as a non-aerated
or passively aerated extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: With extracts, there is no need for
specialized equipment, and one advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of an extract is that it has a much longer
shelf life than a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certified organic production,
teas and extracts can be used if certain
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria are met.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the material is prepared without
compost additives, it can be used on
[SPEAKER_00]: edible crops without restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the material is prepared with
additives, then it can be applied without
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction if the compost tea production
system and materials have been pretested
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet EPA guidelines for a bacterial
indicator of fecal contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the above criteria are not met,
then the particular tea or extract must be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied 90 or 120 days prior to harvesting
an edible crop, 90 days in the case that
[SPEAKER_00]: the tea or extract material does not come
into direct contact with the produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 120 days prior if the material doesn't
come in contact with the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: A reminder that organic producers should
always consult their certification agents
[SPEAKER_00]: before purchasing or using products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, always conduct your own in-house
trials with new materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time.
