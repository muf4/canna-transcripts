[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do today is talk
almost exclusively about undergraduate
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have contributed heavily on advancing
the chemistry and pharmacology and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to present a montage of the
most relevant projects that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: undertaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start a little bit with
these lipidomics and referring in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular to lipids such as folipids,
trigolipids, neutral lipids, and
[SPEAKER_00]: guinozidides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to spend the rest of
the time talking about disease-targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical pharmacology with emphasis on
particular diseases, since that is what
[SPEAKER_00]: really drives planned research in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me start with a little bit about
self-chemical biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's by way of a very early project
that an undergrad undertook in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Matthew Ginsberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an MD degree now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time that we initiated this
project and was financed by a hatch grant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the egg industry in the state of New York
was under heavy financial stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because regulation was
changing and now small and medium large
[SPEAKER_00]: egg producers needed to accommodate
chicken housing requirements, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: larger spaces, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was putting a lot of stress on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a call for grant
proposals on research as to how expand the
[SPEAKER_00]: market of eggs and possibly the
development of added value products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this got my interest because thinking
as a chemist, I look at the egg as a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical factory, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, when looks at the structure of an
egg, is heavily compartmentalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-third of the weight of an egg is
the egg yolk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the egg yolk is actually chock-full of
lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably you know a little bit about
the stories around cholesterol in eggs,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, which actually have
been debunked already.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no threat of cholesterol
intoxication from eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the egg yolk actually is greatly
compartmentalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's composed of what we call overall
lecithin, which is a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're all familiar with the structure
of phospholipids, a glycerol backbone,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated with a head group that can
be choline, ethanolamine, serine,
[SPEAKER_00]: or inositol, and acetylated by various
types of fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So egg lecithin actually has an
application in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the pharmaceutical industry
utilizes the lecithin to formulate drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to be actually administered
parenterally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they're going to be administered
intravenously, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're drugs that actually cannot be
made water soluble, and therefore they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be formulated in these vesicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So egg lecithin has the capacity to form
micelles that can then include different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of therapeutic agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is that, well,
these micelles have had some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: compatibility with mammalian cell membrane
composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea then was to look at the
possibility of deriving from eggs from the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of New York that were appropriate in
composition for this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt the need to put some economic
data into the whole venture as a
[SPEAKER_00]: justification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just recently, the USDA has
established that the value of a grade A
[SPEAKER_00]: large egg is 13 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you look at Signal's catalog,
they sell 250 milligrams of reagent egg
[SPEAKER_00]: lecithin for $59.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one grade A large egg contains two
grams of lecithin worth $472.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I'm not including production
costs, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just to exaggerate and make
the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in theory, if you calculate,
you can increase the value of an egg by
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 3,000 times in egg lecithin
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, as I said,
is this lecithin actually suitable for use
[SPEAKER_00]: by the pharmaceutical industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I recruited the participation of a
New York state egg producer, Creex Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: Fresh Eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kurt Creer is actually the main owner of
the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a family-owned business, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medium-sized egg producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have like 250,000 layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is actually a Cornell alum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gladly participated, providing eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to providing eggs,
he provided also a proprietary diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt very strongly that the lecithin
derived from these eggs was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on the chemical composition of the
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he provided two types of chicken feeds
that they use in their farms, non-EB and
[SPEAKER_00]: EB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are designations that only they
know what they mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's proprietary, the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the corresponding eggs produced
with the different diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the methodology utilized is actually
extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cracks the egg, separates the yolk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the yolk is extracted with a
mixture of chloroform and methanol in 2 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 ratio, evaporated to rhinos,
and prepared for sampling and introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: into a mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, in the core facility,
we had a Squire LC, electrospray
[SPEAKER_00]: ionization mass spectrometer, that one
could actually operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the playground for us for the
next three years, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very robust, instrument,
but very limited in capacity of data
[SPEAKER_00]: processing, because it's single octopole
and ion trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any event, it was very suitable for
the analysis of the lecithin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of Matthew cranked a lot of data,
data processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically the results that we
receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind you, this is the average mammalian
cell membrane lipid composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main component is phosphatidylcholine,
PC, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a little bit of
phosphatidylignositol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we characterized the composition
profile of the feeds and compare with a
[SPEAKER_00]: sample of commercial lecithin that is
utilized by the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the non-EB feed has little
PC large amounts of PE and little PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the EB feeds have larger amounts
of PC, comparable amounts of PE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both, probably the feed that compares
best with the green bars, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of the commercial
pharmaceutical grade lecithin that
[SPEAKER_00]: contains large amounts of PC is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is the profile of the lecithin
that comes from the chickens that were fed
[SPEAKER_00]: one and the other diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: they vary very differently from the
composition of the diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the composition that is closest to the
commercial lecithin is actually the eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: that were laid from chickens that were fed
the non-EB chicken feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost equal to the commercial
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same amounts in PE and very little PI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the lecithin composition
of the eggs that come from chickens that
[SPEAKER_00]: were fed the non-EB diet is very,
very close to the mammalian cell membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were the results that we
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we passed on
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt also that the diets can be
optimized to better adjust than the
[SPEAKER_00]: profile needed for suitable use by the
pharmaceutical industry, given the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the diet is very influential in this
composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why organic and omega-3 eggs can be
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just feed those components to the
chicken, and voila, you get eggs that have
[SPEAKER_00]: high content of omega-3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to illustrate that in addition to
the quantification of the phospholipid
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, we actually did a very detailed
species profile for each one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each one of the phospholipids,
we actually identified each one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers represent the added number
of carbons coming from the two ac groups
[SPEAKER_00]: in the actual phospholipid, including its
level of saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually led to a very robust
research collaboration with a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan Henry that, to this day,
it is maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular case, we actually
looked at lipidomics and the lipidome of
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the manipulation of different
growth conditions and the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: gene-delete mutants, we have a better
understanding now how these metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways were actually regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were fortunate that a newer machine
and more capable was acquired by the core
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a triple quadrupole machine
that can do multiple reaction monitoring
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows us, in combination with HPLC,
to elucidate, in one analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 100 lipid species in samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the lipidome of yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the growth stage,
we normally work with yeast populations
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in this particular early
developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the whole profile of lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardiolipin, sterols, swingolipids,
the phospholipids, neutral lipids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the lyso products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, just as an example, the most
important phospholipid in yeast is
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphatidyl inositol.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the composition per species of the
steady state.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, using now a very innovative use
of the stable isotope, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the novel biosynthesis of all
these species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, by comparison with the
composition of the steady state,
[SPEAKER_00]: infer the level or degree of remodeling
that these phospholipids actually undergo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we do in combination with
all the genetic models.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the genetics behind the yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna move now on to really what I
want to spend the rest of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is disease-targeted botanical
pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the particular diseases that
we're interested in in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very ambitious, but actually,
on a preliminary stage, they're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very accessible, as I will illustrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I will concentrate primarily
only on cancer and the epigenetics of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and a more
recent line of research that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is menopause.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a definition of botanical pharmacology
can be the accumulated and developing
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of the effect and motivation of
natural products occurring in plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation and treatment of disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel that by studying and
investigating the mode of action of a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product, we are better prepared to
provide pharmaceutical industry with lead
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that can actually result in a
clinical therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to, every time that I talk
about a line of research, I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce the students that are
participating in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, progress in these type
of projects is punctuated and cumulative,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it transcends generations of
undergrads as they move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that knowledge and skill and
methodological capacity is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained, and new students are trained
under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the early students that I had
was Douglas, Ryan, and more recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelsea, these two graduate students,
or actually senior graduate students in
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in pharmacology, Rockefeller and
Weill Cornell, and they're almost done
[SPEAKER_00]: with their PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to introduce our interest in cancer
from the epigenetic standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have summarized here the views of the
mechanisms of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the classical view is one in which the
genome has experienced some kind of change
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced by mutations, deletions of
genes, or gene amplifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the classical view and the one
that has been more investigated and for
[SPEAKER_00]: which there is more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is an evolving alternative
view, and that is that epigenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms can actually end this
functionality, can also result in cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mechanisms by which gene expression can
take place is by histone modification,
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two, histone modification and DNA
methylation, actually have been
[SPEAKER_00]: investigated in the context of cancer and
found out that actually they contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: the unregulated proliferation of cancer
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those two, there are already two
drugs that are being used clinically to
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatment of certain hematologic
cancers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my interest in particular, and in a
moment you will see why, was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: histone modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Misregulation of histone modification can
lead actually to the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to remind you, histone
modification can occur in particular by a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism of acetylation and
deacetylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those changes actually are accomplished by
enzymes that we call histone acetylases or
[SPEAKER_00]: histone acetyltransferases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acetylated chromatin leads to gene
silencing, the acetylation of chromatin
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to relaxation and accessibility to
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So misregulation of this mechanism
actually can result in cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is illustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one particular histone, the acetylase
that has been identified in a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: cancers, is CERT-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a mammalian histone acetylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the acetylase contains histones,
but it can also deacetylase proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And illustrated here are two proteins that
actually, the acetylation of those two
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins can result actually in cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One protein is P53 that if CERT-1
deacetylates, deactivates, and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: it precludes the mechanism by which a cell
that has a DNA that is deacetylated and
[SPEAKER_00]: damaged cannot undergo apoptosis or DNA
repair or growth cell development,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that results in tumor suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that CERT-1 acetylase is actually
misregulated, it can inactivate or
[SPEAKER_00]: deactivate P53.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on the other hand, it can actually
activate an oncogene like BCL6 that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually transmitted by the
transcriptional repressor that can result
[SPEAKER_00]: in tumor genus BCL6 and the acetylation of
it has been implicated in a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: type of lymphoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a CERT-1 homolog actually in
yeast, and that is CERT-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CERT-2 is also a histone acetylase and
actually can silence at the telomeric,
[SPEAKER_00]: genes at the telomeric region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a family of histone acetylases.
[SPEAKER_00]: CERT-2 is the most important, but it forms
complexes with CERT-3, CERT-4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole that's called a CERT-2,
and the acetylation actually silences
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to study histone deacetylation in the
context of finding natural products,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can actually prevent their action and
the treatment of cancer, we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I go on to describe the
methodology that we developed to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me just say that these two histone
acetylases small molecules at a time that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were looking into the possibility of
undertaking this type of project had
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two chemicals actually were
critical in deciding what type of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: product we were going to target in the
possibility that we could set up some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of methodology to measure histone
acetylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular molecule had been isolated
from a fungal isolate that was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: repository of the National Cancer
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called splitomycin, and it was found
out that it was a histone acetylase of
[SPEAKER_00]: CERT-2 actually in yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other compound is called Saja for
short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a synthetic compound, and in 2006,
received approval from the FDA to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular type of cell lymphoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this type of chemistry in the
background, and knowing a little of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural products, one could think of
natural product candidates that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: put through an assay to look for histone
acetylase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, you know, where and
what to look for histone acetylase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that, so using these structures
as templates, what came to mind was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kumerins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kumerins have this particular basic
skeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a chromone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a chromanone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see right away the similarity
between the two structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that kumerins, because they
bear quite close resemblance to
[SPEAKER_00]: splitomycin, could actually be good
candidates for histone acetylase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we know, kumerins are widely
distributed in the rotaceae, asteraceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: and insoma paeaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other group of natural products
that were closely resembling Saja are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually alkylamides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so these type of compounds are
widely distributed in the rotaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: piperaceae, and somasteraceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, there is an overlap
between the presence of kumerins and
[SPEAKER_00]: alkamides in the rotaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotaceae became the first target family
to investigate for this type of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how are we going to do
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we actually, I saw the advice of
the Susan Henry group and decided that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if we're going to use yeast to
investigate histone acetylase activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we need to actually engineer a yeast
strain that will have a reported gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reported gene that was decided to
use was a URA-3 reported gene introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: in the telomeric region where the
sirtuins, histone acetylases in yeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the chromatin is acetylated,
there is no URA-3 expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is acetylated, then there will be
URA-3 expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to translate this theoretical
concept into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay, so I'm not going to discuss the
conditions that are required for this
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and how the reporting is going
to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather describe how we accomplish
actually this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yeast strain that was actually
engineered was done with a plasmid that
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually provided by Thomas P. It's
from University of North Carolina that
[SPEAKER_00]: contained actually the whole right arm of
chromosome five in which the URA-3 gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: reported gene had been introduced in the
telomeric region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by homologous recombination,
we actually engineer a yeast strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: contain now the reported gene in the
appropriate place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, what is it that URA-3 does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, URA-3 actually is a decarboxylase in
the uracil biosynthetic pathway from orte
[SPEAKER_00]: to uracil that removes the carboxyl group
from orodin 5-phosphate and yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: uridin monophosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, in this type of methodologies,
one can actually give, where the gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: operational, we can give the cells this
particular compound 5-fluoroerotic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is erotic acid that has a fluorine
in this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the cell processes it, it results
in the formation of this suicide inhibitor
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 5-fluorouracil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on whether we allow for URA-3
to be expressed or not, we kill or not
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a way to actually set an
assay to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So illustrated here is if the sirtuins,
the acetylate, the telomeric region,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the cells can actually grow in the
presence of 5-FOA because URA-3 is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually non-expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the sirtuins, the acetylate,
and URA-3 is actually expressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the cells are not going to grow
because they're going to form this
[SPEAKER_00]: compound which is actually toxic to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be done very easily in liquid
media, but I have always had a tendency to
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify things for expediency and what I
wanted to develop was an assay on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, but that actually could be used in
solid media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept was if we deposit a histone
acetylase in a filter disk and we
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce it in a Petri dish and inoculate
with this particular construct,
[SPEAKER_00]: will it show cell growth inhibition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotinic acid is a histone acetylase
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the presence of
it, there is no cell growth, and without
[SPEAKER_00]: it, cells grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a system, rather simple,
but at the same time complex because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of reporting, that we can
actually now interrogate natural product
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry for histone acetylase
inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, the Rotace became the first
target family to investigate for natural
[SPEAKER_00]: product chemistry that could actually
inhibit histone acetylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the time, it was almost winter,
and so we had to refer to what we had in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse, and we had actually two
species of citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had this particular Rotace,
Citrofortanella mitis concuat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we had actually limon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prepared actually extracts of the
leaves of these two Rotace, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: put them through the assay, and the result
was that well, the crude chemistry of a
[SPEAKER_00]: methanol extract of these Rotace,
actually the one from the limon doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit the growth of the cell,
so that means that there is no histone
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylation inhibition, while the extract
of concuat does so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pursued then the chemistry of mitis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular case, we were actually
targeting, and the reason why we tested
[SPEAKER_00]: methanol extracts is because we were
targeting the cumulants in citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pursued simitis, and so this right
away became a big challenge, because we
[SPEAKER_00]: could not reproduce this biological
activity at will, and every time that we
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared an extract of concuat and tested,
we would either get a positive result or
[SPEAKER_00]: we would not get a result at all,
and this was very puzzling, and after
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewing data accumulated, we noticed
that the only extracts that were given a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive result were aged, quote unquote,
extracts, and that aging required at least
[SPEAKER_00]: one month of sitting on the bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we tried freshly prepared extracts,
there was no activity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was actually later confirmed when
we started now to suspect that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the two types of
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we applied the chemistry to that,
we compared HPLC composition profiles of
[SPEAKER_00]: old and aged extracts, and we found that
actually, there was a change in profile in
[SPEAKER_00]: which one compound that was prominently
present in the fresh extract, in the one
[SPEAKER_00]: month old extract, actually decreased in
concentration, while another compound or
[SPEAKER_00]: component actually experienced the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it started with very low
concentrations, and after one month,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was actually high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This already suggested to us that this
change in composition actually was key to
[SPEAKER_00]: the biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We further tested that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started using mass spectrometry,
and we found, in effect, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that, in the fresh extract,
is very low in concentration, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular weight of 377, and after one
month, actually is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went after that compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did bioacid-guided fractionation,
and that actually resulted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidation of the active principle that
it is only active after the parent
[SPEAKER_00]: compound has actually produced it in large
amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the mechanism by which this
change occurs, whether it is chemical or
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, it was confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the comparison of the mass
spectrum of the parent compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the mass spectrum of the
product that is the active one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the result of the loss of these
two sugar molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this compound, which is a
furanocumerin, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually a histone acetylase inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other students came along, and we
targeted, then, a different rotational
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, centoxyloamericanum, in this
particular case, northern prickly ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been reported that
centoxyloamericanum contained 5-MOP,
[SPEAKER_00]: acumerin, and this particular alkamide,
5-alpha-hydroxysensual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to find out if either one of
these two type of compounds actually were
[SPEAKER_00]: histone acetylases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extracts actually were prepared,
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the response, a strong response,
to one partially purified fraction that
[SPEAKER_00]: came from colon chromatography,
and we further pursued this biological
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it resulted, then, in a fraction that
was rich in a family of compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are actually derivatives of
cuspidial, which is a phenylpropanoid type
[SPEAKER_00]: of compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we further fractionated using silica
gel colon chromatography, gradients in
[SPEAKER_00]: separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found fractions that were active,
and that, by thin layer chromatography,
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that it was only one compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all contained it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We combined and tested, and the activity
is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the compound that was identified by
mice spectrometry is actually this
[SPEAKER_00]: cuspidial analog, cuspidic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're calling it, and it's
actually a histone acetylase inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a different avenue to
fractionation of centoxyloamericanum
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we isolated also an additional histone
acetylase gamma-sensual, which it hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been reported, actually, in
centoxyloamericanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually an alkamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the choosing of the RITASI,
because they combined this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry that has been shown by analogy
to be histone acetylase, it paid out,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now, in summary, a few
compounds one furanocumerin, and one
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylpropanoid, and actually one
alkylamide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this in the course of about four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let me move on now to a
different disease, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Alzheimer's is becoming a big problem,
not only in North America, but globally,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we have an increasing aging population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it will experience certain incidents
of Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in combination with the fact that
current therapies in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's disease are actually not very
efficacious clinically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this interest in Alzheimer's actually
started out in 2009 with these two
[SPEAKER_00]: students, Scott and Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them already were awarded their MD
degrees, and newer students like Burnell
[SPEAKER_00]: and Raleigh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the neuropathology of
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very early on, upon post-mortem studies,
it was actually found out that an
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's patient's brain actually has
experienced considerable shrinkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neuronal loss mainly occurs in the
cerebral cortex and the hippocampal
[SPEAKER_00]: region, where the cholinergic network
resides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cholinergic network actually is
responsible for memory and cognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, affecting these parts
of the brain results in loss of those two
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So histological preparations had also
shown that associated with this neuronal
[SPEAKER_00]: loss, or the formation of plaques,
that now we call them abinoid beta amyloid
[SPEAKER_00]: plaques, and also accumulation of protein,
tau protein, fibrils inside of the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that causes Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on these results and biochemical
studies of brains of Alzheimer's
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, it was noted actually that
levels of acetylcholine, the
[SPEAKER_00]: neurotransmitter, in these areas of the
brain was actually very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first hypothesis or model proposed
for the disease was one in which the
[SPEAKER_00]: result, the Alzheimer's disease was
actually the result of a low concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: of acetylcholine in this synaptic cleft
between two neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acetylcholine is actually made from
acetate and choline by a choline
[SPEAKER_00]: acetyltransferase and degraded by an
enzyme that is called
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholinesterase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when acetylcholine is released into the
synaptic cleft, finds its way into
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors which are in the postsynaptic
neuron, one of them, the muscarinic
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine receptor, is actually a G
protein coupled receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was then proposed that that
signaling cascade that resulted from that
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction actually was affecting the
processing of APP, which is the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually is the precursor to the beta
amyloid peptide, which aggregates into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plaques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cholinergic hypothesis that was
proposed in 1975 blamed low amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft for
the production of the beta amyloid
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this model, it was very clear what
the solution was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then develop a drug that could
actually restore normal levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that target was actually the
cholinesterase, the acetylcholinesterase,
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first and only generation of
actually drugs, what they do is they block
[SPEAKER_00]: the activity of acetylcholinesterase by
restoring normal levels of acetylcholine
[SPEAKER_00]: in the synaptic cleft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clinically, it was predicted that if
that was the case, then downstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of beta amyloid peptide was
going to decrease and the progression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the disorder was going to slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the drugs that are in current
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cholinergic hypothesis was proposed
in 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first drugs that came into clinical
use were Aricept and rivastigmine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound is completely synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually derived from a natural
product, visostigmine, that occurs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: African legume, which is actually very
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other compound actually,
or the other acetylcholinesterase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor, approved in 2004, is
galantamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually occurs in a host of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just cited daffodil because it's very
timely right now to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is used as it is found actually in
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an alternative treatment that
blocks actually the receptor of glutamate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it is thought to contribute to the
formation of the tau-protein-fibrils in
[SPEAKER_00]: the neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all that exists in clinical
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their efficacy is actually extremely
poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given the interest that we had in this,
and I'm going to start to abbreviate
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm running out of time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to look for
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, what type of plants
are we going to look for to screen for
[SPEAKER_00]: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetylcholinesterase inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants that we decided to target
were plants that have been claimed to
[SPEAKER_00]: possess neurotropic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neurotropics are defined as agents
that can be or act as memory enhancers,
[SPEAKER_00]: neuro enhancers, cognitive enhancers,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the adenobotanies are rich in those
types of descriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question now was, how are we going
to measure this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had actually a fluorometric assay
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not very practical to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good at quantitating activity
and gathering kinetics, but not very quick
[SPEAKER_00]: for targeting a particular component in a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we opted to use an alternative,
which is a bioautographic assay that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be developed in a thin-layer chromatogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It entails resolving the components of a
mixture on TLC, applying the enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a reagent that generates a
background and contrasts with a
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration, which is actually an
indicator of acetylcholinesterase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whitish discoloration here is
actually Aricept, the drug that is used
[SPEAKER_00]: clinically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we had an assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided, then, on what plants we
were going to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first plants that we
actually targeted was maca, Lepidium
[SPEAKER_00]: aieni, and Andean brassicae.
[SPEAKER_00]: That traditionally is used for the
treatment of male infertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that it lists as another benefit,
actually, improvement in memory and brain
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we diagnosed that these areas of
discoloration, in particular, were due to
[SPEAKER_00]: alkaloids in maca, as we got a positive
with dragendorf reagent, which is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: specific for alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went on to isolate those
components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to discuss in depth,
but these are the types of alkaloids that
[SPEAKER_00]: are found in maca.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very unique, imidazole type of
alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, maca, this brassicaceous
plant, contains also alkylamides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be the foundation for the
claim that maca probably benefits memory
[SPEAKER_00]: and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another plant that we, another
nootropic plant that we targeted also is
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemmonbal, Belisophysinalis indelamiaceae,
that there is a claim that alleviates mild
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the foundation assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the spots that we targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others, but we felt that this
was the major component.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a phenolic compound, as it keeps
positive with ferric chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we decided that very
likely this compound was rosmarinic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run HPLC analysis, compared with an
authentic sample of rosmarinic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, it's there in the
extracts of the plant and confirmed by
[SPEAKER_00]: mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the, in summary, these are
the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: One alkylamide and two alkaloids from
Lepidium aionii and one phenylpropanoid in
[SPEAKER_00]: Melisophysinalis rosmarinic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so lastly, I'm just going to briefly
discuss menopause and our interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: menopause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually is an extension of the
Alzheimer's disease interest that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So participants in this project or
research is Mary Ann, Kumal, Janette,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Heather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had interest in actually
phytoestrogens for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was very pragmatic,
and that is, well, this particular group
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants have been utilized for a
purported estrogenic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two, black cohosh and red clover,
have been utilized in alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment of menopause symptomatology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other two actually have been used
traditionally as galactagos to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: breast milk production in lactating women.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt that these two types of effects
were caused by the presence of estrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: mimics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we felt that there
was no really good hold on the estrogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemistry had been described, but never
conclusively demonstrated that those
[SPEAKER_00]: reported compounds were the
phytoestrogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a revisionist type of approach,
we decided, okay, let's look again at
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now an interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plants to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we needed now was to find out,
how can we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So menopause is a age-related biological
phenomenon that results in the loss of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive capacity of a woman,
and is caused by gradual decrease in
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen production in the ovaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we reviewed the literature,
and we're getting ready to investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen mimic activity, we realized that
estrogen was actually integral to a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of symptoms associated with menopause.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the classical ones,
and they are the result from that decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: in estrogen and decrease in progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing actually caught our
interest, cited amongst the umbrella
[SPEAKER_00]: designation of psychological symptoms,
was actually poor memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that caught our interest, though,
how is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what is the relationship between
loss of memory or decline in memory and
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are a number of studies that
actually have conclusively demonstrated
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is an association between,
or correlation between the progression of
[SPEAKER_00]: menopause and the decline in memory and
cognitive function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the more recent ones,
published in 2013, conducted at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Rochester, which a group of
middle-aged women in different stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: menopause were actually tested
physiologically and psychologically for
[SPEAKER_00]: verbal learning capacity, verbal memory,
fine motor skills, and attention-working
[SPEAKER_00]: memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, these bars represent
the women, the groups of women in the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages, and as you can see,
especially in verbal memory, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: decline associated with progression of
menopause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true for all of the other
functions that actually were measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have actually a very concrete
evidence that there, too, are associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, mechanistically, why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, looking at the literature,
we've now been able to summarize some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brain functions that estrogen actually
performs in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So estrogen actually is a regulator of the
enzyme that biosynthesizes acetylcholine,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the enzyme is choline
acetyltransferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this enzyme is under positive
regulation of estrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other function of estrogen is
envisioned as regulating the processing of
[SPEAKER_00]: APP, and via the modulation of the enzymes
that cleave APP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the presence of estrogen,
the amyloidogenic pathway that leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: the formation of the amyloid plaques is
actually downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third property is actually,
if you notice, a ring of estrogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: aromatic with a hydroxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound is antioxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it performs also a neuroprotective
function in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you remove estrogen, estrogen from
the brain, all this happens, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The protection of antioxidant is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The upregulation of CHAT is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less acetylcholine is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually increases the risk in a
woman to develop Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know very clearly the statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women are at twice the risk of developing
Alzheimer's disease than men, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually led us to formulate a
different approach to the study of
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogens because of the role of estrogen
in menopause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking for now is what I
call combinatorial pharmacology implants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is chemistry implants that can act as
an antioxidant, that can act as a promoter
[SPEAKER_00]: of acetylcholine formation, and that can
act as an estrogen mimic to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have encountered now, actually,
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we assay for estrogenic
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We engineered, again, another yeast cell
with this particular plasmid that contains
[SPEAKER_00]: the human estrogen receptor and a beta
galactosidase-reported gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plasmid is introduced in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have now an engineered yeast cell
that, upon the stimulus of estrogen or an
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogen mimic, actually triggers the
expression of beta galactosidase that
[SPEAKER_00]: process OMPG to OMP that we can measure
then spectrophotometrically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the proof of a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such construct treated with estrogen
results in a positive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first plant that we actually
approached for study is phenugreek,
[SPEAKER_00]: a favase used since antiquity for
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is used, actually, as a galactogal
prominently to increase lactation in
[SPEAKER_00]: women.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to, I'm just gonna go to
the results and the chemistry that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually isolated and identified
conclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one estrogenic component of phenugreek
is actually dalgenin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We isolated, characterized it,
and evaluated it as estrogenic activity is
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chloroform methanol extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the aqueous ethanol extract of
phenugreek, actually, we isolated three
[SPEAKER_00]: isoflavones, which are actually the same
three isoflavones plus present in soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that these isoflavones,
I mean, have a estrogenic mimicking
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're present also in phenugreek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the presence of this chemistry is
actually responsible for the estrogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have defined a larger group of
plants to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The junior undergrad students that are
working in this project have established
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogenic activity, antioxidant activity,
and acetylcholine esterase inhibition
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the process of isolating the
active principles in this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them in the lamina.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them in the ac, primarily salveas,
which are, or have been shown to be
[SPEAKER_00]: estrogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna stop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to acknowledge, see,
I knew that I had too many slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a summary of chemistry that is
estrogenic and acetylcholine esterase
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the isoflavones and diolginine,
the estrogen mimics in phenugreek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another plant that we have studied is
ajoan, trispermum ami, in the APAZ that
[SPEAKER_00]: contains estrogen mimics, phenolic acids,
all of them, which also show acetylcholine
[SPEAKER_00]: esterase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like just to acknowledge the rest
of the undergrad students that have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: in my life throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get the chance to talk about
their projects in chemical ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: malaria, diabetes, and cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them already in graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
