[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good morning, everyone, and welcome to
our webinar on success with laser
[SPEAKER_04]: scarecrows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Julie Kickert with Cornell Cooperative
Extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm on a regional vegetable program in
the western part of the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: We call ourselves the Cornell Vegetable
Program.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just, so I have my co hosts and
presenters, Rebecca Nelson Brown and David
[SPEAKER_04]: H Brown on the line from the University of
Rhode Island, and they will both be
[SPEAKER_04]: presenting about the scarecrow that
they've developed and tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one of my collaborators Chuck
Bort, who's also with Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_04]: Extension in the eastern part of the state
of New York, the eastern New York
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial horticulture program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we welcome both of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to acknowledge the funding
sources that have made development of the
[SPEAKER_04]: laser scarecrow possible, and also
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently, we have a specialty crop
multi state block grant program that
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca Brown is the lead PI on it comes
from the USDA agriculture marketing
[SPEAKER_04]: service.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuck and myself and Marion souffl√© from
the New York State IPM program have a New
[SPEAKER_04]: York farm viability grant, allowing us to
help also do some of the work and Rebecca
[SPEAKER_04]: and David Brown and others have had past
funding from the Rhode Island farm
[SPEAKER_04]: viability specialty crop block grant,
and sustainable agriculture research and
[SPEAKER_04]: education projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I was the one that kind of
dreamed up this, this webinar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops, sorry, I think I advanced that
without wanting to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what, what are we trying to do
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our learning objectives are one to
provide a background on laser scarecrows.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Rebecca Brown is going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people on here who don't know
anything about the laser scarecrows are
[SPEAKER_04]: curious for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have some folks that have tested
the University of Rhode Island or other
[SPEAKER_04]: scarecrows on their farm previously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca has experience with definitely
sweet corn, and some grapes and small
[SPEAKER_04]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we have some other folks who
are on there who might be interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: tree fruits or other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you'll be interested,
at least to hear the general background.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you're not interested in
continuing with the more probably specific
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion that focuses a lot around sweet
corn, which is our primary crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're welcome to leave at any time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be offended or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after the general background,
we're going to give an overview of the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Rhode Island laser scarecrow
device and the improvements that have been
[SPEAKER_04]: planned for 2022.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how to get hooked up for getting a kit
for those devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then throughout this, both in Rebecca
and David's presentations, we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: really help growers understand how to set
up and adjust the devices in their on
[SPEAKER_04]: their farm so that they have success.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did some had some test lasers out
Chuck and I did last year and grower
[SPEAKER_04]: field.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were also growers throughout the
northeast and some other regions that
[SPEAKER_04]: purchase devices, kits, put them together
and then put them out in their own field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a kind of a wrap up webinar back
in early November, talking more about the
[SPEAKER_04]: research and had some of the growers on
talking about their devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a number of people have had success
with the devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was picking up on and concerned about
the number of growers that said they
[SPEAKER_04]: really didn't have success.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came in on this project last year,
and it was a huge learning curve for me
[SPEAKER_04]: about how to set up the devices,
how to adjust them and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I'm really set up for good
success.
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, but we I personally learned a
lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned a lot that informed what
improvements needed about the devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our goal really is anybody that's
interested is to try to right from the
[SPEAKER_04]: start.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you need for success.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to be around all season as
resource folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want this to work for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is the right thing for your farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chuck and I are going to give some tips
from our programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like any of the growers that
tested to also chime in and give some
[SPEAKER_04]: tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we hope to have a good period for
question and answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do need to end by 1030.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of my part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully now we've got everybody in
on board and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to stop sharing my screen
and invite Dr. Rebecca Brown to share what
[SPEAKER_04]: she has.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get started with her
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rebecca, if you could share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you can see my screen now and I
can.
[SPEAKER_04]: See that.
Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am going to start things off this
morning with just a general introduction
[SPEAKER_05]: to laser scarecrows.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I will hand the microphone over
to David, who will talk more specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: about the mechanics and the engineering
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So laser scarecrows are very much designed
to work against birds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take advantage of the fact that birds
rely on sight to detect threats.
[SPEAKER_05]: People often ask about using laser
scarecrows against deer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't work as well against deer
because deer don't rely on sight as their
[SPEAKER_05]: primary threat detection sets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Birds have really good eyesight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It varies from species to species,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, birds eyesight is 10 times
better than humans, both their ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: see colors and their ability to sense
motion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's said that pigeons can see the stars
move and they can also see things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: moving much faster than we can make them
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Birds, of course, especially flocking
birds, find a certain amount of safety in
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that this means is
that if you have a stationary visual
[SPEAKER_05]: deterrent, such as a tube man or a
windmill or something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: the effect radius is going to be fairly
small because the birds are willing to
[SPEAKER_05]: take the chance that there might be an
attack because there's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, odds are that it'll be somebody
else who gets caught.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also very intelligent and birds
are able to quickly identify and ignore
[SPEAKER_05]: things like scary eye balloons and
effigies, as well as startling noises.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one reason why propane cannons
have a limited effectiveness is that just
[SPEAKER_05]: like we tune out a constant background
noise, the birds will start to tune it
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the challenge given all of this is how
do we repel birds from a large area
[SPEAKER_05]: without physically traversing the area?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could hire someone to drive around
your cornfields all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: With an ATV, and I've heard of farmers
doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, that gets very expensive
and it requires that you give up land for
[SPEAKER_05]: the ATV to drive on so that it's not
crushing the crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a problem not only in
agriculture, it's also a problem in
[SPEAKER_05]: situations such as airfields where you
don't necessarily want someone rushing
[SPEAKER_05]: around the airfield all the time in a
vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you need to keep the birds away from
the planes that are taking off or landing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the solution to this, which was
actually come up with quite a while ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: was to use light and in particular,
highly focused light, which is what we
[SPEAKER_05]: call lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The advantage of light is that it can
reach a very long distance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it doesn't pose any sort of
physical resistance, so it can move right
[SPEAKER_05]: past things right through a crop canopy
without causing any injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: For this reason, lasers have been
investigated for bird control since really
[SPEAKER_05]: the early days of laser technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first researchers working on this were
in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those researchers at the time were limited
by the state of the laser technology in
[SPEAKER_05]: those days.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were using gas lasers, which were
very fragile and also required an
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely large amount of power.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that limited their use.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also didn't really in those days have
any way to automate the lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since then, improvements in both laser
diode technology and battery technology
[SPEAKER_05]: have removed most of these limitations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're probably all familiar with
handheld laser pointers, which take
[SPEAKER_05]: advantage of both of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the 1990s, we started seeing lasers
adopted by airports and industrial sites,
[SPEAKER_05]: primarily in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were mostly handheld human operated
units they often look like large
[SPEAKER_05]: flashlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a greatly expanded beam and
they're powered by batteries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were also some stationary automated
units that would turn on in response to
[SPEAKER_05]: stimuli, but didn't move.
[SPEAKER_05]: With these units, the emphasis was on
covering large areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the beam ranges were up to 8,000 feet
or more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these handheld devices are very much
still on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The limitation with them is, of course,
that you have to have a human operator at
[SPEAKER_05]: all times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that makes the most useful for
situations such as airports, where the
[SPEAKER_05]: risk of monetary damage from a bird strike
incident is so much greater than the cost
[SPEAKER_05]: of having an employee patrolling with a
handheld laser that it makes financial
[SPEAKER_05]: sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since 2010, there have been further
improvements both in laser technology,
[SPEAKER_05]: but even more importantly in microcomputer
technology and in solar panel photovoltaic
[SPEAKER_05]: panels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solar panel technology that have made
solar powered autonomous laser scarecrows
[SPEAKER_05]: possible and reasonably affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, lasers, since they do pose
a risk of harm, both harm to eyesight and
[SPEAKER_05]: for higher power lasers, a risk of burns
or starting fires.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lasers are very strictly regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of the regulations around lasers
are quite old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it creates a very complex
regulatory environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this has discouraged commercialization
of mid-range models.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, if you look at the
commercial landscape you have very low
[SPEAKER_05]: power models designed for consumer use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have expensive high-end
models that have very elaborate safety
[SPEAKER_05]: programming and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, early research with lasers through
the 90s and the early part of this century
[SPEAKER_05]: assumed that lasers would only be
effective under low light conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so most of the studies targeted
roosting birds in the evening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most of these studies were not very
effective at moving birds away from their
[SPEAKER_05]: roosting sites.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could disturb the birds, but
oftentimes the birds would come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly once they stopped treating
the roosting site with a laser,
[SPEAKER_05]: the birds would come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, more recent studies, including
our work has focused on daytime use
[SPEAKER_05]: targeting feeding birds and has been much
more successful, particularly when the
[SPEAKER_05]: laser is automated and able to operate
continuously during the daytime.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is just a clip taken at late dusk
that shows you what the laser beam looks
[SPEAKER_05]: like as it moves through a cornfield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to note that I have slowed
this down to one quarter of its actual
[SPEAKER_05]: speed so that you can see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One advantage of the laser is that it can
cover an area pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you saw in that, the beam is
basically moving through the tassels on
[SPEAKER_05]: the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can only see the laser beam in low
light conditions like this, but the birds,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they have so much better eyesight
than we do, can see the laser even when
[SPEAKER_05]: the sun is shining.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to talk a little bit about
some of the questions that we frequently
[SPEAKER_05]: get asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, why are birds scared of
lasers?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't actually know because of course
we can't get into the mind of the bird,
[SPEAKER_05]: but people who study bird behavior have
suggested that birds may perceive the beam
[SPEAKER_05]: as a solid object.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they move in order to avoid that
object.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is true that in corn, what we have
seen is that the primary effect of the
[SPEAKER_05]: laser is that it stops the birds from
perching on the tassels, which they
[SPEAKER_05]: usually do before they move down into the
canopy to feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also by stopping perching on the tassels,
it will cause the birds that are keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: watch for all of their flock mates to
move.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will result in the entire flock
moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many people ask if birds become acclimated
to the lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a really good question because of
course that is the failure of most bird
[SPEAKER_05]: scare technology, is that the birds become
acclimated to it over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have some colleagues at the
University of Florida who have been
[SPEAKER_05]: testing exactly this question using
capsules of active European starlings in
[SPEAKER_05]: an outdoor aviary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they have found is that the birds
do not appear to become acclimated to the
[SPEAKER_05]: lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they may actually become more
sensitive, more afraid of the laser with
[SPEAKER_05]: repeated exposure.
[SPEAKER_05]: This study is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one season worth of data at this
point and are going to start a second
[SPEAKER_05]: season within about a month.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully by later this year,
we'll have an even more conclusive answer
[SPEAKER_05]: to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does appear that birds do not
become acclimated to the lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another question we often get is what
birds are controlled by lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously not every species of bird
has been tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, lasers seem to work best on
birds that flock together rather than
[SPEAKER_05]: moving about as individuals or just a few
of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been research studies that have
successfully used lasers on geese,
[SPEAKER_05]: cormorants, gulls, blackbirds,
robins, cedar waxwings, starlings,
[SPEAKER_05]: and cowbirds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are other studies currently
underway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of different species are being
controlled using lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to talk just a little bit about
using lasers specifically in different
[SPEAKER_05]: crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for any crop, you need to start laser
protection before the birds begin feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: in the crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: With sweet corn, this means starting
before the corn is mature, before the
[SPEAKER_05]: birds begin moving into the field and
checking the corn out.
[SPEAKER_05]: In sweet corn, you want to mount the laser
at tassel height with the beam horizontal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this clip that Julie was kind enough
to share with me shows you where it should
[SPEAKER_05]: be positioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see she has the laser right in
there with the corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the beam moving across the
green shield, showing that it's basically
[SPEAKER_05]: projecting horizontally out over the
field.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your corn field is sloped, you want to
put the scarecrow at the top of the slope
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically project the beam at an angle
down the slope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, it's hitting the tops of the
tassels.
[SPEAKER_05]: The URI laser scarecrow has been designed
so that the beam cannot be projected more
[SPEAKER_05]: than five degrees above the horizontal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is because one of the risks of
using lasers is that if you're projecting
[SPEAKER_05]: a laser up over the horizon into the sky,
there's the possibility of it shining
[SPEAKER_05]: through the windows of an aircraft that is
taking off or descending towards landing
[SPEAKER_05]: and causing flash blindness of pilots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using a laser to interfere with aircraft
operation is illegal in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will get you into big trouble with the
FAA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so since many of the URI units are
being used in peri-urban aircraft,
[SPEAKER_05]: in areas where they're within 20 mile
radius of an airport, we designed the
[SPEAKER_05]: units to make projecting the beam up into
the sky impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, I know there are situations
such as fruit orchards where you may want
[SPEAKER_05]: to project the beam at an angle above the
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the commercial units can do
that, but you have to be very careful when
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing that to make sure that you're
not impacting air traffic.
[SPEAKER_05]: With plants that are of varying heights,
you want to use the ability of the laser
[SPEAKER_05]: to move back and forth on the vertical
axis to hit all of the tassels.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got a crop that, say it's two
feet tall, two different planting blocks
[SPEAKER_05]: side by side, and one is shorter than the
other, you need to make sure that you put
[SPEAKER_05]: the laser scarecrow on the side with the
shorter plants so that they're not being
[SPEAKER_05]: shaded from the beam by the taller plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because remember that laser beams travel
only in line of sight.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't see something, you can't hit
it with a laser beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: And birds will sneak in under the beam if
it's going over the tops of the tassels.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll just basically treat it like a
roof and duck in under that roof and get
[SPEAKER_05]: into the canopy to cause damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, as Julie said, most of our research
has actually been with sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what all of our grant funding has
focused on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have done a little bit of research
on other crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are constantly seeking funding to do
research on more crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have learned a little bit about
using lasers in crops other than sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing we've learned is that for short
crops, whether it's seedling corn that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're trying to protect from geese and
crows or turf grass sod that you're trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to protect from winter feeding by geese or
strawberries, any short crop, you will
[SPEAKER_05]: actually want to mount the scarecrow as
high as practical.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see down here, this is a
commercial unit that unfortunately is no
[SPEAKER_05]: longer available in the US that we were
testing on a Kentucky bluegrass sod farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got it mounted on top of a
traveling irrigation rig about 15 feet off
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you aim the beam down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you want to do is set the
vertical movement of the laser so that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're sweeping the crop from the base of
the scarecrow to the edge of the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you need to be careful with a short
crop that the beam doesn't go into a
[SPEAKER_05]: roadway or a neighbor's windows,
that you keep it to your field.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that does seem to be the most
effective way to try and keep particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: geese out of field.
[SPEAKER_05]: For blueberries, on the other hand,
you want to mount the scarecrow about
[SPEAKER_05]: three feet or one meter above the canopy,
and then move the beam through the entire
[SPEAKER_05]: vertical range of motion as well as
horizontally so that you're covering as
[SPEAKER_05]: many different points in the canopy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: What little we've learned about using
laser scarecrows in grapes, it seems like
[SPEAKER_05]: the approach you take is going to depend
on your training system.
[SPEAKER_05]: If all of the clusters are basically at
the same level, then you can treat grapes
[SPEAKER_05]: like corn and use the laser to create a
virtual lid over the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if the clusters are at all different
heights, then probably it needs to be
[SPEAKER_05]: dealt with more like blueberries,
where you're moving the beam through many
[SPEAKER_05]: different places in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I want to close here just by
mentioning sources of laser scarecrows.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is currently only one real source of
commercial lasers that are designed for
[SPEAKER_05]: use in agriculture and other serious
outdoor bird control settings.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the AVIX Autonomic from Bird
Control Group.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are sold all over the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: The company itself is in the Netherlands,
and then they have a North American office
[SPEAKER_05]: out in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a commercial product from a
full-service company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will even come and install your unit
for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They provide on-site tech support,
a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are 500 milliwatt lasers that can
cover very large areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the crop, a single unit can
cover as much as 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are designed to operate 24 hours a
day year-round, even in the winter with
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, this is all going to cost
you, and the list price of these units is
[SPEAKER_05]: about $10,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a good unit, but they're a very
high-end unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up next, David is going to talk about the
URI Laser Scarecrow, which is the one that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been using in all of our research.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an experimental unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an open-source unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: The design is available on our website.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use 50 milliwatt lasers, and we're only
able to cover up to nine acres,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we are deliberately targeting the
grower with smaller fields or with fields
[SPEAKER_05]: with lots of different elevations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you're not going to get the economy
of scale that justifies using the larger
[SPEAKER_05]: lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our units will not operate at night or at
temperatures under 40 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_05]: so they're not currently a good option if
you're trying to keep geese off of fields
[SPEAKER_05]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are available as a kit for $650.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is only a limited number of these
kits because we aren't actually a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial enterprise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, for those of you tuning in
from Canada, the complexity of shipping
[SPEAKER_05]: lasers across international borders means
that we're only able to offer the kits in
[SPEAKER_05]: the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also will not do on-site tech support.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do offer tech support via email or
phone, but again, it's not like we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: large staff of people who can come out to
your farm and help you set the thing up
[SPEAKER_05]: and operate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, we are actively looking for
someone or multiple someones interested in
[SPEAKER_05]: commercializing the URI laser scarecrow or
a design based on our unit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There definitely seems to be a market for
a small or smaller unit that is able to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell at a significantly lower list price
than the AVEX Autonomic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd invite folks to either put their
questions in the chat or unmute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'll just take a few minutes here
before we transition to David.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one question, Rebecca, that I
thought about that someone asked me here
[SPEAKER_04]: recently, and that is, does the laser beam
hurt the eyes of the birds?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a really good question,
Julie.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a question that many people have
asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: The answer to that is that actually we
don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Esteban Fernandez-Juricic at Purdue
University is actively working on this
[SPEAKER_05]: question.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has found that if you shine a high
power laser beam directly into the eye of
[SPEAKER_05]: an immobilized bird, it will in fact
damage the bird's eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not all that surprising.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, what we haven't been able to
determine yet because of limitations on
[SPEAKER_05]: funding is what the chances are in a real
world situation where the birds are moving
[SPEAKER_05]: around, foraging, free to fly away or turn
their heads, that a bird will actually
[SPEAKER_05]: take a direct hit to the eye from a laser
beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an area of active research and an
area that we're hoping to get some answers
[SPEAKER_05]: to over the next few years if we can get
the funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, detecting damage to bird's
eyes requires euthanizing the birds and
[SPEAKER_05]: then doing a pathological examination of
the eye, and that is extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: This really limits our ability to do these
studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca, we've got a couple of comments in
the chat box.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one says, Hi, we have been using
the scarecrow for a couple seasons here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had much luck, especially with
crows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone noticed crows being deterred?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not tested the lasers against
crows.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a big crow problem at the
research farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: They should work against crows,
but again, it really depends on whether
[SPEAKER_05]: you get the laser out there before the
crows find the corn, and also probably on
[SPEAKER_05]: the flock size.
[SPEAKER_05]: Crows are pretty brave, and if there's
only a small number of them, they may not
[SPEAKER_05]: be startled enough by the laser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca, that just reminds me of something
we were talking about a couple days ago in
[SPEAKER_04]: preparation for this meeting, and that had
to do with crows in an urban setting that
[SPEAKER_04]: roost on trees and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you could just address that real
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have actually been studies done out
in Davis, California, looking at using
[SPEAKER_05]: handheld lasers to try and eliminate crow
roosts from urban areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they found was that the lasers were
effective at removing the crows from the
[SPEAKER_05]: roost if the trees were treated right at
dusk as the crows were coming in to the
[SPEAKER_05]: roost, but the effectiveness of the
treatment stopped if they stopped treating
[SPEAKER_05]: the trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would probably work, but in an urban
setting, it would probably mean using a
[SPEAKER_05]: handheld bird control laser and sending a
human operator out every evening to treat
[SPEAKER_05]: the trees as the birds were coming in to
roost.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an urban setting, you have to be really
careful with an automated laser because,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, there are a lot of people
around and thus a lot of risk that someone
[SPEAKER_05]: could be impacted by the laser beam and
potentially suffer eye damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where you would want a human
operator.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can work through some of
these other messages.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next one said, you mentioned a
nine-acre coverage, but do we know what
[SPEAKER_04]: the effective distance of the beam from
the scarecrow and lineal feet?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that is something we are still
trying to get more data on, but do you
[SPEAKER_04]: have any other comments on that,
Rebecca?
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, at present, we're pretty
comfortable saying that a 300-foot radius
[SPEAKER_05]: would be protected by our units.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, this is something that we're
still trying to actually determine what
[SPEAKER_05]: the maximum distance is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, of course, depend on the terrain
and also on the crop in that if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: projecting the laser down onto something
like seedling corn, you can get a much
[SPEAKER_05]: larger radius than if you're projecting
horizontally, depending on the height.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was getting as much as 600-foot radius.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the unit mounted on the irrigation
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was also a flat field and the
unit was 15 feet above the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rebecca, along these lines of a
nine-acre coverage area, because you are
[SPEAKER_00]: designing these units for multi-plantable
acres in terms of- Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have one planting usually in one
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had three or four different
plantings all coming in within a week of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other in one field, where would you
recommend someone place the laser?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you put it in the middle of the
field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you put it between two plantings and
then as soon as they're done, start moving
[SPEAKER_00]: it over to the later plantings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on a number of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it would depend on the
differences in plant height among the
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got, say, a really early short
variety and then the next one to mature is
[SPEAKER_05]: a taller variety, you would want to put
the scarecrow on the side towards the
[SPEAKER_05]: shorter variety and then projecting into
the taller variety because otherwise,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not going to be able to protect
both.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also, of course, have to take into
consideration things like roads.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be projecting the beam
towards a roadway.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you certainly can put it in the
middle of the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would give you the widest coverage as
long as you don't have too much variation
[SPEAKER_05]: in plant height and you don't have
something such as a road, that's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that answer your question,
Chuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's a lot of chat going
on and David and Chuck have been helping
[SPEAKER_04]: answer some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of those questions will be
answered as we move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, and I know this was a question I had
wanted to raise, was about safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the field, when you have workers out in
the field and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think David answered the question in the
chat box that we would recommend turning
[SPEAKER_04]: that laser off while you had workers in
the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: But do you have any other comments on
that, Rebecca, before we move on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that these are class 3B lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulations do require eye protection
if people are working inside the hazard
[SPEAKER_05]: distance.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not turning the lasers off when
you have workers in the field,
[SPEAKER_05]: ideally, they should have laser safety
glasses that they're wearing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no risk of burning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you stare directly into one of
these beams, you could have retinal damage
[SPEAKER_05]: and certainly repeated eye exposure over
time is going to cause things like
[SPEAKER_05]: cataracts and other cumulative damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to look directly into the
beam.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, these beams, if the scarecrow
is operating normally, are constantly
[SPEAKER_05]: moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: That, combined with your blink reflex,
really lowers the likelihood of actually
[SPEAKER_05]: getting a beam directly in the eye for
long enough to cause damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, it's best to err on the side of
safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said, what is the hazard
distance?
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't actually measured it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to look it up for these
specific lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Dave remembers off the top
of his head what it is for these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did calculate this near the end
of the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We realized that was an omission from the
initial user manual based on the output
[SPEAKER_01]: power beam diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And divergence using the ANSI Z136.1
calculation, we came up with a nominal
[SPEAKER_01]: ocular hazard distance of 16 meters or 53
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're outside that range,
you should not be adversely affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you did happen to look at the beam
within that range, I would suggest you
[SPEAKER_01]: keep your head down and walk over to the
switch and turn it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's time for Rebecca to stop
sharing her screen and then David,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if that's what you're doing,
and then David could get set up for his
[SPEAKER_04]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca, real quickly, there was another
question about if you had tested the
[SPEAKER_04]: lasers in sweet cherry orchards at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not tested them in sweet cherry
orchards.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a very intriguing study to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have any sweet cherry orchards in
Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that there have been reports of
lasers being used in sweet cherry
[SPEAKER_05]: orchards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, this is a fairly new technology
in terms of being used in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's lots of studies that
haven't been done yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have some cherry orchards here in
New York, especially below the Lake
[SPEAKER_04]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know one of our fruit specialists is
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ever want to test them or they
do, see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be interested in testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could probably find a cooperator to test
it in sweet cherry orchards for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, well, you know, it would be great if
we could find some money, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Craig, we'll be in touch about
that.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, David, let's go ahead with your
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so I wanted to start just to
address some of the chat questions a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to HTTP colon slash slash laser
scarecrow dot info that will redirect you
[SPEAKER_01]: over to this Google page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, if you click on the twenty
twenty design, which we are no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: providing, but some of you have,
you will be able to access, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: the user manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that when I clicked on that,
did that open a new window and no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: be what shared, I think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll have to tell it to share that
anyway, if you I'll switch to the PDF I
[SPEAKER_01]: had opened that that opens the PDF and to
answer one of the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here under laser specifications is
where we provide the information from
[SPEAKER_01]: which we calculated for you that nominal
ocular hazard distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't mean that the beam is
perfectly safe beyond that distance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but within this distance, you should take
extra care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are numerous cautions and advice
provided here in the manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will find similar text in the
instructions from other devices that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might be able to obtain.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we know about laser safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is certainly a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe that we have designed the
device to comply with the required in the
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA has responsibility for it for lasers
as a source of radiation that can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we believe that our design is in
compliance with those regulations and file
[SPEAKER_01]: our paperwork and get our accession
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me switch over to what the main
idea was.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wanting to talk about the design
improvements and I'll try to make this
[SPEAKER_01]: understandable for people who haven't
worked with the previous designs also and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to put some of these issues in context
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I presume somebody would have told me if
that weren't these slides weren't visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of history on the
scarecrow project.
[SPEAKER_01]: My involvement started as a helpful
faculty spouse when Rebecca said,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you've been playing around with these
Arduino things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you could come up with a way
of wiggling a laser around a field?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your first design was quite crude
plywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything kind of nailed or hot glued
onto a plywood base with a chain drive and
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of kind of messy, but got the idea
across.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a couple of years, we were able to
upgrade that to a belt drive and circuit
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a little bit of trouble selecting the
3D printed material.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one we did kind of melted,
thus the need for the reinforcing wood
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it didn't melt, but softened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twenty twenty, I think, was a really
substantial improvement in that we found a
[SPEAKER_01]: slip ring where we could put a drive shaft
straight through it and not deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: either a belt or a chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're continuing that idea in twenty
twenty two with the current design.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major changes are that we no longer
have that plywood base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was basically having trouble fitting
some extra components we needed on the
[SPEAKER_01]: circuit board around the motor stand and
suddenly had this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what if we just had the circuit
board go around the motor stand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we have a circular circuit
board, the motor main board, slip ring
[SPEAKER_01]: holder, all mount to that bucket bottom
with just four screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pinball tilt switch had been giving us
a little bit of a trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've moved that to a tinier sensor
on the main board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no longer having a plywood base to
that key switch that is required by FDA is
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to the motor mount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not shown are the external controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may notice that compared to the
previous design based on a five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, this is based on a three and a
half gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduce the wind load.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back to a white bucket with black
tape, partly because white buckets are
[SPEAKER_01]: what we could find and the black tape
versus the aluminum is a little easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: obtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we're looking we've had some
difficulty with the tape sensor not being
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go from about two lux at dawn to 40 or
50 thousand lux in full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just really difficult for the
tape sensor to maintain accuracy through
[SPEAKER_01]: that range of ambient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're planning and working on the
software that will just kind of map out
[SPEAKER_01]: the range of rotation at power on and then
use an extra magnet and magnet sensor to
[SPEAKER_01]: help track the rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the big changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many potential areas of improvement were
suggested by growers and fellow
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers such as Chuck and Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have organized the rest of the
slides to kind of go at what the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think are most relevant and most
interesting and working on down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the challenges with operating
the 2020 and earlier designs are that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is basically on that one main
circuit board, which is inside the bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: under a very tight gasket lid and on the
top of your 10 foot pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes control changes rather
awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also some slight confusion with
using the software, having to wait 15
[SPEAKER_01]: seconds before it saves the changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2022, these little waterproof boxes
are surprisingly expensive, but some other
[SPEAKER_01]: cost savings help make it possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got that at the end of a 15 foot
cable, so you should be able to just stick
[SPEAKER_01]: that down at the bottom of the pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a push button on it so it knows
when you're trying to make changes and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it'll just save the changes when you
switch it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that should be a lot easier in this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I mentioned that we'd had some trouble
with the tape sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one couple of changes we've made
have found a sensor that is better
[SPEAKER_01]: optimized for longer distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still some device to device
variation, and it seems to lose about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: percent of its sense range between a dark
room versus full 40,000 lux sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what we got on a nice day
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm happy to say that despite that,
I still have a nice gap between the
[SPEAKER_01]: reflectance of the white bucket and the
black tape where we should always be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in case we can't, we've got this
little magnet will be mounted along with
[SPEAKER_01]: the tape sensor and this magnet sensor
will be mounted inside the bottom bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: at a fixed position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that wherever you put the tape,
it can map that out initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just counts how many steps
it's taken with the motor to know its
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in case it gets bumped or blown
around by the wind or something every once
[SPEAKER_01]: in a while, it will also double check its
position against that magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that hope that that will be working
reliably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still have to finish the software on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, can you explain what the tape sensor
is for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tape sensor allows you to mark an area
that the scarecrow should skip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, if you need to put the
scarecrow at the side of a field,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe because the field's right up against
a road, you might block off by marking the
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the bucket with tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tape sensor would see that and
say, oh, I should shut down the laser and
[SPEAKER_01]: skip rapidly over this area to get back to
somewhere I can be useful that cover that
[SPEAKER_01]: well enough, Julie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rebecca mentioned that we have ours
designed not to work at night,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least once it's truly dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd been using just a standard cadmium
sulfide photoresistor, which has been how
[SPEAKER_01]: light sensors have worked since forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these do seem to be inconsistent from
part to part.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one that won't turn on
rapidly, I can talk to you about putting
[SPEAKER_01]: in an extra parallel resistor.
[SPEAKER_01]: To increase its sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still working on figuring out the part to
part consistency of a replacement
[SPEAKER_01]: phototransistor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this phototransistor has the advantage
in that it is specifically designed for
[SPEAKER_01]: dawn dusk sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should offer some improvements
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I've found that as soon as I
get to like about 10 lux, it's almost at
[SPEAKER_01]: full level and the 10 lux is nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like you can barely see where
you're walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another reliability issue is the
pinball tilt switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for telling you when
something's tilted over and this micro
[SPEAKER_01]: switch was able to completely remove power
to the scarecrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had a weird thing happen where wind
consistently and constant wind could make
[SPEAKER_01]: the scarecrow on the pole oscillate a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the right frequency, that seemed to
actually make the pinball lift off the
[SPEAKER_01]: switch and shut down the laser,
even though it hadn't really been tilted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the replacement for that is just this
tiny little two millimeters square IC on
[SPEAKER_01]: the main circuit board that is an
accelerometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it measures the pull
of gravity in three directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we find that we've got less than
0.9g pulling down, we know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: scarecrow has tipped over 45 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would not happen in light wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the disadvantage being that's software
only, it won't completely shut off power.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can certainly turn off the laser
and stop the motor if we detect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use of assembly and mounting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2020, I was able to provide a CNC
pre-drilled plywood base so that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: get all your mounting holes in the right
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, there were 16 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them you can see the accessing
the screws for the main motor here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle are a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I provided a custom tool for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you assemble one of the 30
available 2022 kits, you'll find that it
[SPEAKER_01]: is much simpler.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all these attachments have been
replaced with just four machine screws
[SPEAKER_01]: that go into captive nylock nuts in the
base of the motor stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things that having
that idea of putting the circuit board
[SPEAKER_01]: around everything instead of off to the
side facilitated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of a challenge for some
people in getting the spiral arm position.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy to get it too far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would lose a lot of its range
and not start pointing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some very slight differences in
geometry to try to help ensure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get the full range of motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But perhaps one of the most useful things
will be just this little hole in the side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the spiral arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do your post assembly testing and
turn it on, turn it off again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the servo will have gone to this
midpoint position.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can just align that dot with
the middle of the laser module.
[SPEAKER_01]: This spiral arm pushes the laser down to
get the lower angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes up, the laser
points horizontally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be easier to assemble
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some trouble with a 3D printed
coupler pandemic issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not able to get a good quality 5
millimeter adapter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I printed one that worked fine,
but you had to keep tightening it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you use Loctite, it crumbles
the plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to find a good source of
aluminum couplers eventually and sent them
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had a 2020 kit and you didn't
get that upgraded yet, you should have
[SPEAKER_01]: received those parts and can do that if
you had any trouble with these screws
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple unlucky people managed to damage
one of the, we start with 12 volts from
[SPEAKER_01]: your battery, reduce that to five volts
for the electronics and also to four and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half volts for the laser though,
honestly, the laser would be happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: five.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we're tackling the laser meant
that if you put that buck converter in one
[SPEAKER_01]: position off, they were separate from the
circuit board, little daughter boards that
[SPEAKER_01]: you plugged in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were off by one pin, you could
damage the converter board and
[SPEAKER_01]: microcontroller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've just totally bypassed those
separate power modules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, we have one shared power module.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is designed right into the main
circular board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I also threw in a couple of fuses
right on the little resettable fuses right
[SPEAKER_01]: on the circuit board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should help make sure that nothing
goes too weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with that lid and
accessing the controls is the strength of
[SPEAKER_01]: the gasket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how these corners really pull
right over where the bucket lid would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've found a vendor that has an easy peel
lid that goes with their buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems to be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to keep liquid from
escaping the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want rain to go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a couple heavy rain storms,
did not perceive any water coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly if you're more comfortable with
the gasket of lid, given that you no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer have to access the interior
controls, you could grab one of those at
[SPEAKER_01]: the hardware store.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this easy peel lid is what we'll be
providing in the kits for 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Scarecrow itself is mounted.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow our model of mounting it to
a half inch iron pipe, we have the pipe
[SPEAKER_01]: hanger, a couple of screws, and that's how
the laser Scarecrow holds itself onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: pipe with a little brace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the same pipe hanger to mount the
emergency stop switch box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we've also got a box for the
external controls and it's like six
[SPEAKER_01]: screws.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's starting to sound a little bit
annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found these spring clamps that we'll use
instead they'll be on the back of these
[SPEAKER_01]: little pieces of PVC trim that hold the
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be able to just snap those
by pushing them onto the pole or pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should make things a little bit
easier there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Added a piezo buzzer to provide a warning
tone that will provide some feedback on,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, perhaps most importantly,
the pre laser warning tone where in 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have a buzzer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, we just spin the arm around
rapidly a few times as your pre emission
[SPEAKER_01]: warning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably still do that, but also
have the buzzer going there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also be able to use that to indicate
error modes that, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've said we really need to make sure
we see the tape here, but it can't sense
[SPEAKER_01]: the tape for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or fails to home, then we could indicate
that with a tone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I can't get the pitch low
enough to make it sound like it's snoring
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's asleep, but we'll maybe make it
click every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie's video showed laser barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hers were seemed to be a little bit
translucent green, which was sufficient to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower the intensity, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And diffuse the beam.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it easier to set that up,
we found that black poly report covers
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get at copy shops,
office supply shops, and we'll include one
[SPEAKER_01]: that with the kits seem to work really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can cut them to size and shape,
and they're stiff enough to just slide it
[SPEAKER_01]: in between the outer bucket and the inner
bucket and do a fine job of blocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The laser not showing right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this is the tape sensor,
and so what you'd want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would also put some black tape around
here if you were actually trying to block
[SPEAKER_01]: this area, and that would instruct the
laser.
[SPEAKER_01]: This the circuitry to skip that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're planning to also take a just a
common deburring tool and peel off a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bevel from the outside of the
laser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the inner bucket and the inside of the
outer bucket, just to make that easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to slide that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you like this idea and have a
2020 design or earlier, that's how we make
[SPEAKER_01]: the little devil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be able to do that pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have one of those tools there
already, they're fairly inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We the design for the laser attenuator,
the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this little ring at the end of the
laser that these ridges would hook onto in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've never seen that they actually
fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seemed a little imprecise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the addition of this O ring
around the end of the laser, you can now
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of screw that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even more securely than the previous
version useful for transport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're setting it up and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that was confusing is sometimes
people go out to their field and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the laser and, hey, it's not doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns OK, I turn it off and back on
and it's fine again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what you're seeing was that based
on the manufacturer recommendations,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were asking, letting the laser cool
down for five minutes every 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes because they recommended a duty
cycle of two to four hours, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing compared to a summer day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some testing and found that while
the laser module would heat rapidly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It after about it didn't continue to heat,
it went from an ambient temperature of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 22 to somewhere around 30 and just
stayed there a little bit with colder
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furnace came on in the morning,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that big drop is where I
accidentally knocked it over and decided
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the end of the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the laser seemed fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't seem to have any trouble living
at 30 degrees centigrade instead of 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're not including that cool down
anymore in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people had trouble with the
crimp terminals pulling off the wiring for
[SPEAKER_01]: the emergency stop switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hire a student with greater
hand strength to do the crimping and also
[SPEAKER_01]: are using marine style crimps with heat
shrink and a waterproof wire nut for the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that just go together instead of
having spade and tongue terminals on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put our scarecrow, show it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really minor, but if we're going
to try to keep things straight and level,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seemed like we ought to try to fit the
pipe better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's that half inch iron pipe into the
one inch PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made a little shim to take up that
extra space and also spent some time
[SPEAKER_01]: calculating the taper of the bucket much
more precisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a thicker pad on the bottom
and a thinner pad on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It honestly probably doesn't make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your pole isn't necessarily
straight anyway, but it might help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minor assembly issue is that you had to be
careful of the shaft when assembling it
[SPEAKER_01]: because the shaft, you can see the end of
the shaft was just a little too long and
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't want to bend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've shorted the shaft a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can just put the bucket bottom
on a flat surface and push the bucket top
[SPEAKER_01]: straight down onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also makes it easier to stack multiple
units if you do have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the major changes that we've
made for the design in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably too late to make further
changes to the kit design, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely want to know if you experience
issues or failures using the device,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything I haven't mentioned, please do
let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as of right now, I think Rebecca has
said this is the last year of the grants
[SPEAKER_01]: we currently have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So future development isn't certain,
but knowing what can be improved is always
[SPEAKER_01]: useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, David.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to have Chuck Bornt go next
with some of his tips as we were about 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as he's preparing to share his slides,
David, could you address how long do you
[SPEAKER_04]: think it takes to assemble one of the new
kits roughly?
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the cost and how to get one of
the kits and then any other questions you
[SPEAKER_04]: might address in the chat itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question was, whether you can apply
any of these upgrades?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the upgrades do require a
different microcontroller and different
[SPEAKER_01]: software.
[SPEAKER_01]: One grower has indicated an interest in
upgrading two of the kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about five test boards that I might
be able to do upgrades with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll certainly be talking with that
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still need to work on the details of this
first assembly time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it should be faster than the 2020
kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been able to do one from start
to finish myself yet, but I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably about four hours,
depending on your comfort level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a look at the assembly
instructions from 2020 on that website and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll try to provide similar quality this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cost we are going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so as Rebecca said, the 2018 kits
cannot easily be upgraded.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are because of the circuit board
being completely new, but the drive
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism is the same and the slip ring is
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not completely impossible either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not my current focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your last question was the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Rebecca mentioned that we are
trying to let these kits out the door at
[SPEAKER_01]: very close to our cost and expecting that
to be six hundred fifty dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if people are interested,
they can email you and Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Rebecca can put that email in the
chat again and we can certainly address
[SPEAKER_04]: that at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to move on with Chuck's
short presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: David, if you want to address any of those
chat questions, you may certainly do that
[SPEAKER_04]: in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So go ahead, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Julie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can hear me OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to talk a little bit
about how we mount our lasers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's one of the questions that I
seem to get quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no I don't think easy way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just how we decided to do
ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Julie has a really cool way
that she developed for mounting hers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to remind everyone through
some of the general components and why we
[SPEAKER_00]: use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so, you know, we just make a simple
cross with some treated two by fours and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go ahead and mount that floor flange
that you see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went ahead and bought a 10
foot length of half inch threaded iron
[SPEAKER_00]: pipe that I cut in half and then just
screwed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of our base right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again, five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have you'll see these two pieces of
three eights rebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used long bolts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are essentially what we use to
pound into the ground to keep that that
[SPEAKER_00]: base from moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had pretty good, pretty good
success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to obviously don't put them
in two foot, but just get them in enough
[SPEAKER_00]: so that that base doesn't doesn't want to
walk or, you know, move, move on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just moving on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the upper half of our unit,
because I had already purchased and had
[SPEAKER_00]: some half inch electrical conduit,
that's what we mounted the actual bracket
[SPEAKER_00]: that holds the bucket to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allows me to do is I can
then take the electrical conduit,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much put it side by side to the
electrical pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use two heavy duty hose clamps
and I just tighten those down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows me to I can adjust that
height anywhere I want to, which is is
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to make sure you have a good
socket wrench with the socket with with
[SPEAKER_00]: the right socket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I can do is I can unloosen
one of these, get enough loosen this one a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slide it to where I think it's got to be
and then tighten it right back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty, pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also pretty inexpensive, which is another
thing I'm all about trying to use what I
[SPEAKER_00]: had around the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we also added a a solar charger,
a trickle charger so that we don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep swapping out batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this the one that we purchased was
it's a forty five dollar unit off of
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 20 watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve volt 10 amp amount of crystalline
waterproof solar panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially they don't give you
anything to mount those panels with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just went ahead and I had some of
these L brackets and just a simple pipe
[SPEAKER_00]: clamp to these one on the bottom,
one on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a little bit longer than the other
just to get a little bit of an angle to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked out really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could move that unit around pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, that's essentially
what my unit looks like in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also nice to put that battery up off
the ground, but it also gives some weight
[SPEAKER_00]: on that base to keep it from from floating
or moving that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still say that the battery is
probably still the hardest part to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the heaviest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to walk this thing into the
field by myself with the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scarecrow unit, the base and a two or
three pound sledgehammer to pound those
[SPEAKER_00]: rebar pieces in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do it by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this is just a really short video,
but one of the things that we've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: is the fact that even a little bit of
breeze and you'll see the breeze kick up
[SPEAKER_00]: here in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David alluded to this earlier with the
tilt switch that was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that little bit of wiggle was
bouncing that ball in there and we kept
[SPEAKER_00]: having the unit turn on and off with the
new the new changes this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hopefully that's not going to be
an issue moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually and I think it might have been
on David's recommendation, took a piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: foam like off a pool noodle or something I
had and stuck in the in the where the
[SPEAKER_00]: pinball is in that tilt switch just to try
to limit the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not sure, you know,
more rigid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Julie uses a T post,
which might be a little more rigid,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then takes a little more effort to get
in and out of the field, I think,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's essentially, as I said,
how we have set ours up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I need to point this out because
I spent probably about an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: one day on the cables that come.
[SPEAKER_00]: David puts a little piece of red tape on
the positive wire cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, somewhere along the lines that
slipped off and I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have to follow all of that
cable back to figure out which one is the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive and which one was the negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so go ahead and putting some alligator
clips on those instead of just a bare wire
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably help or just making sure
that you you keep that that wire,
[SPEAKER_00]: that red wire on there to make sure you
always know what is your positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your your ground or your negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could probably the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably also just stick a piece
of black tape on the on the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal negative wire, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would would kind of clear that up
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, the things that we
found and we've been working with these
[SPEAKER_00]: units since 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that, you know,
as far as efficacy, I do feel they work
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's another tool to add to our
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like anything else, there's these
little caveats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rebecca alluded to it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get them out there early before
those scout birds are actually out looking
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they if you can keep them out,
I think you'll do a much better job of
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the rest of the flock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to I try to get out there just
as soaking starts or midway through
[SPEAKER_00]: soaking or even at the very tail end of
soaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot set it and forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go out and check on it once in
a while and make sure they're working,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the battery is charged or
charging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's still, you know, a little bit
of time that you need to spend to just
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you're running properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I everything that we've done, 90 percent
of what we've done, there's been some
[SPEAKER_00]: other deterrent in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we've been using it with
propane cannons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a laser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe on one end and the cannon on the
other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that just keeps those birds on
edge enough because they don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if it's the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if it's a if it's a scare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can back that up there
with a shotgun blast every once in a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's hard to do in in places
where you have neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it just reinforces that whole
idea and keeps them on their on their
[SPEAKER_00]: toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, these units,
really the URI units have been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're low cost enough where
I think you can have a couple of units and
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have a couple, especially in
in fields where you have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings so that you can kind of keep
moving them along along the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the tips that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Natasha and I are technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that we got pretty good at
assembling these units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we had it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be two of us working on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had it down to about an hour a unit,
which I thought was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I will offer my assistance wherever
I can, at least for our region,
[SPEAKER_00]: for those of you that might want to try
one or interested in purchasing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, Julie, that's that's really
all I had to to share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks so much, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're getting just about out of
time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to show a couple things about
my setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm going to skip through that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make sure I'm doing a slide show.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, OK, just quickly, this is how the kits
came to us last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked on assembling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had had fun doing it, but I wasn't the
quickest person really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really great kits that are really
well organized, great directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to just emphasize one thing is
say this is last year's kit and that is
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure before you go to the field,
you understand how to control the kits,
[SPEAKER_04]: how they work, that they actually are
working.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last year's kits have a speed,
an angle that controls the tilt of the
[SPEAKER_04]: laser and then what was called a wiggle
that can allow for motion in the vertical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, David has changed this,
but it took a lot for me to understand how
[SPEAKER_04]: to to operate all this, what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me tell you to go out in the field
and try to do it the first time was not a
[SPEAKER_04]: good system for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I made almost all of the mistakes
that everybody else talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the end, I really understand how
they work and and I think that that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: good thing for success.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, again, I had it in my office and I was
able to test it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So either if you have a battery or David
supplied me with an electrical cord that I
[SPEAKER_04]: could plug in in my office and that
worked.
Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, to make sure with this laser had a
cap on it and you could watch it spin
[SPEAKER_04]: around or the one on the right I had just
shining on the wall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, please be careful to protect your
eyes if you're doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, set up in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebecca already showed you this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working a very large processing
sweet corn fields in western New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: My setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had on the left, I had a very sturdy
post that I got from our local Lowe's
[SPEAKER_04]: department store.
[SPEAKER_04]: These were the heaviest duty ones you
could.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pounded those in the ground and then I
had to have something some kind of post
[SPEAKER_04]: that I could transport in my sedan car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came up with these telescopic poles
that are used for like the pool industry
[SPEAKER_04]: where you could attach your different net
or whatever and then scope them out 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 feet into a pool to scope up bugs or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to make the point that these
posts at the bottom had some holes drilled
[SPEAKER_04]: through and I actually bolted those onto
my steel post that didn't go all the way
[SPEAKER_04]: into the ground because I couldn't get it
pounded in, but they were pretty sturdy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular setup, I also put another
post next to it and kind of tied
[SPEAKER_04]: everything together with duct tape and
little straps and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go with that later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can see I chose a smaller
size battery.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are still 12 volt.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something that would be used in
like a golf cart or a scooter.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're 23 pounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no way in heck I was able to
lift a 50, 60 pound battery like Chuck was
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was how I managed the advantage
of the telescopic pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very easy to unscrew these two
sections and slide them up and down really
[SPEAKER_04]: easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a little better.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one again was where I had the two
posts that were kind of duct taped
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had actually ended up having the on off
switch up more at user height,
[SPEAKER_04]: which made it really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's how you basically unscrew these
two different things or loosen them up and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can adjust the height of the
laser.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time trying to get the
laser height right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then in the end, we were collecting data
and we had a 10 foot PVC pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or later on I actually did have a
measuring tape out there and we were
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting how many of the ears in that 10
foot section had bird damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to just show two of my grower
setups.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was one grower we were working with
in Niagara County.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a 10 foot pole.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, he had it kind of he pounded in
a T post and connected this laser to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty sturdy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also wanted to point out he had
scare eye balloons.
[SPEAKER_04]: This grower, I think he had the laser too
high up in the air, but the grower was
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And reduction in the number of flights.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last slide I'm going to show,
this is another grower we had down in
[SPEAKER_04]: Chautauqua County.
[SPEAKER_04]: He mounted his black iron pipe onto this
tote that has the wire gridding on the
[SPEAKER_04]: outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he had it permanently mounted to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think he's got it too high up in
the field, but he was able to move that
[SPEAKER_04]: tote around with a forklift or tractor or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: In his field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see he's got aisles or row
laneways down his sweet corn fields and
[SPEAKER_04]: was able to move it around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the right hand side,
he was also using these air dancers,
[SPEAKER_04]: which he was actually fairly happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were powered by a little generator.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a series of four or five of them
down his laneway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to end that presentation and
stop sharing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are a little bit over our time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like, so anyone that wants to jump
off, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll leave the chat and the presentation
open if anyone wants to hang on for more
[SPEAKER_04]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So apologize that we ran over a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we have a lot of experience to
share, but we really hope if you are
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in or obtain the scarecrows
that you know we're there to support you
[SPEAKER_04]: and continue to have questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we really want to make sure is
that you have success.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have any questions, please
contact us either now or at the end or
[SPEAKER_04]: during the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'll leave it open if anyone wants
to unmute or put more questions in the
[SPEAKER_04]: chat box.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another question about how do we order
those laser scarecrow kits?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Rebecca or David want to unmute and
just address that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Email brownreb at URI.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Dr. Rebecca Brown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she put her email in the chat box
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but I would also mention that URI is
not interested in us just selling kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you request a kit from us,
you are paying for the parts and also
[SPEAKER_01]: agreeing to participate in the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are allowed to distribute the kits as
part of Dr. Brown's research program and
[SPEAKER_01]: will ask you to contribute your
observations from the field to that
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And David, when can you address when you
think the kits are going to be available?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am hoping for our semester and last day
of classes is May 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to have those kits available
right around then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately need to be able to finish
the user manual in order to send that to
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA as part of our application for that
session number before we can release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then having the user manual done means
having the software done and all the kits
[SPEAKER_01]: designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'm hoping to be able to finish
that up in another month or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks for addressing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been incredibly impressed of how much
thought has gone into these laser
[SPEAKER_04]: scarecrow and truly how much testing and
just realized that to get to this point,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, we are pretty confident that
laser scarecrows, as Rebecca presented,
[SPEAKER_04]: do work against birds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to iron out a lot of the
details.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the feedback that came in last year
after a number of growers had these out in
[SPEAKER_04]: the field really informed this design.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could see all of the changes that
took place for the 2022 units.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really looking forward to testing those
out in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to jump on and thank Julie for
organizing this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, you're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael has asked a couple of times about
any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: of lasers working with mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the answer is that there is
anecdotal evidence that it does not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually studies that it does not
that lasers do not work with deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With deer specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, specifically.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we could ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking, like, what other mammals
might there be?
[SPEAKER_04]: So raccoons are right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They create a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you said, they tend to come in at
night, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the units that we have turn off at
night.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the light sensor, when it gets to dusk
or dark, will turn the units off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they will be turned back on at
dawn because they are designed for scaring
[SPEAKER_04]: the birds away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, David was thinking about voles
also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't I don't think that's going
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Voles mostly do their damage at night,
don't they, Rebecca?
[SPEAKER_05]: Various times they'll do it during the
day, too, but I really given how low they
[SPEAKER_05]: are to the ground, I don't think they
would care about a laser.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wish they worked with voles,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I also thought voles had poor
eyesight.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they see better than moles do,
but I don't think they have great
[SPEAKER_05]: eyesight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rebecca asked if fields are surrounded by
houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this present a safety concern?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time you're using a laser near humans,
you need to be concerned about safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you can do is mount the
laser high and aim it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also set up the tape and barrier
system to exclude the area of houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if it's like on one side or a
house here and a house there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if you've got like a community
garden plot surrounded by houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is probably not a good pest control
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lasers, you know, if they're if you just
can't get it around humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's that's a good point,
David.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't get into my setup,
but one of my big processing fields that I
[SPEAKER_04]: had last year, even though the field
there, you know, I would have called the
[SPEAKER_04]: field mostly flat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that where I entered the
field was sort of like a dip and there was
[SPEAKER_04]: a road there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as I was driving towards the field
over the road, one time I saw the flash of
[SPEAKER_04]: that laser and I scared the heck out of
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, and there were houses kind of on
the other side of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, I can't have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I put the laser down a little bit
further into the corn canopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that was where I also had that
green plastic barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was enough to you know,
eliminate that flash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I spent a lot of time looking at what
was going on in that field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also again, if you can go out there
either on a really cloudy day or
[SPEAKER_04]: preferably at dusk, you'll see what's
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, at dusk, if the laser is
turning off, you can just shine a
[SPEAKER_04]: flashlight on the light sensor and that'll
make it, you know, run.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I was really concerned about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that you just have to be aware
and look at your setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not on a really flat surface,
again, trying to be at the top of the
[SPEAKER_04]: hill, point it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that road was a good a thousand feet
away from my laser setup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking, oh, you're only going
to be able to see this like for 300 feet
[SPEAKER_04]: or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not that it was going to damage
anybody's eyes or anything out that far.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could see the flash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was kind of worried if one of the
houses, you know, they see me going in and
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the field could probably see that
unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, this is not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never had any complaints from the farmer
or the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was really, really cautious about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, it looks like in the chat,
we're just talking about trying to get
[SPEAKER_04]: those the laser beam in sweet corn across
the top of those tassels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, if you're too high,
right, there's a possibility of the birds
[SPEAKER_04]: flying underneath the beam.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess I just say, you know,
go out there, see what the birds are
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it look like they're deterring?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, you know, hopefully we're
scared of hearing them away from your
[SPEAKER_04]: sweet corn fields and that there's
something else for them to eat somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just it's too much of a headache
to be in the sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_04]: But boy, once they get a taste of that
sweet corn, then it's pretty hard to to
[SPEAKER_04]: stop them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody have experience with finch or
chickadee size birds and blueberries?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to say, I don't know
Rebecca's answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say I had
[SPEAKER_04]: some goldfinch, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what their name is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the little yellow ones in the
summer that come around, eat the thistles
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff, goldfinches, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Eastern goldfinch.
[SPEAKER_04]: The name is escaping me, but they didn't
seem to be bothered.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they were sitting on the tassels,
they didn't seem to be bothered by the
[SPEAKER_04]: presence of the lasers or actually even my
presence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, any experience with other
birds?
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't really tested it on finches and
chickadees.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have observed that sparrows are not
impressed by lasers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will ignore them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, what I've seen in blueberries,
again, is that the birds that tend to feed
[SPEAKER_05]: in very small flocks or individually are a
lot less affected by the lasers than the
[SPEAKER_05]: ones that feed in larger flocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Rebecca.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think looking at the time,
I need to let my presenters off the hook
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go ahead and close the
meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
