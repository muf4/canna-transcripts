[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Sue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to see you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would just tell everybody where
you're from in the chat area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to formally start it here
as soon as it reaches 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Sue Guise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get started just in one
minute or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll give people another minute to
log on and we'll have a brief introduction
[SPEAKER_01]: of the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of you have done this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure how many people will
join us for the day, but maybe this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because this is a big presentation,
we're going to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank all of you for logging on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to explain that we're
experimenting all the time with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am out in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the hotel room in Western Michigan
right now at the Great Lakes Fruit Worker
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Greg Loeb is in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the advantages of being
able to use this technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to show everybody, make sure
they're aware of how to get around this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to stay as close to this as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me actually drag it down and see that
we will be ending by two, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is your chat area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This bar here is where you type in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you hit the readout.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any problems with the chat,
you can give me some icons or something
[SPEAKER_01]: right down here in the lower left hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be a flag or something that
will happen to show me that you're having
[SPEAKER_01]: some challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe I can address that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are recording this session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along with the other ones,
in case you've missed them, we do have
[SPEAKER_01]: them on the webcast page that all of you
have the URL to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we did differently
this time is we sent a handout in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have it posted here in
this file sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that you would be able to
download it right from this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even as a recording, you can get the
handout.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at this point, I'm going to,
we're going to move into the classroom
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't appear to be that anybody else
is joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go in here and I'll introduce Dr.
Greg Loeb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an entomologist with Cornell
University specializing in fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he works out of the New York State Ag
Experiment Station in Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is going to help us as extension
agents better understand and manage some
[SPEAKER_01]: important insect pests of berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Greg, if you want to take it from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beautiful day outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways it's too bad we're stuck in
here, but hopefully it'll be worth your
[SPEAKER_00]: time in learning a little bit about some
of the insect and mite pests of small
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move through this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying not to go too quickly,
but there's a number of insect pests I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I do that, though, I wanted to
share with you what objectives I am trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to accomplish in this 50 minute or so
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things I thought about as I put
together the slides of what I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also included on the handout
that Laura got out to you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things, since you guys
all have responsibilities for lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops and topics, one of the
things that might be helpful in dealings
[SPEAKER_00]: with small fruit is simply to be able to
identify or recognize the major pests in
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I'm going to give you enough
information to help you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important in developing a management
strategy to have some sense of when these
[SPEAKER_00]: insects or mites are present in the
various crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least a rudimentary sense of pest
phenology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all the pests I'm going to talk
about today, I'm going to kind of show you
[SPEAKER_00]: what that phenology is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably won't remember all of it,
but it gives you some kind of basis to
[SPEAKER_00]: build on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of the pests, we have developed
pretty good monitoring tools to evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you have enough of them to warrant
some sort of control tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll talk about those when they're
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also talk about some control
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm not going to dwell a lot
on the chemical control, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you through the guidelines
and some other sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I certainly will mention a few things,
and more importantly, the proper timing or
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy behind their use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also going to talk about other
control techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I'll remind you of some of
the places you can go to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: information if you're dealing with a small
fruit crop and a pest in that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess if you have problems,
just send it through on the chat room and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next slide is going to be review for
a lot of you, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had this in coursework or certainly
just in experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's worth looking at just to
provide some sort of framework for
[SPEAKER_00]: assessing some of these key pests I'll
talk about in a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the core of an IPM program is a good
understanding of biology and ecology of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, the phenology and life
cycle is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need this information to really move
forward and to develop a pest management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy, especially in an era of chemical
control when that's not the only potential
[SPEAKER_00]: tool you have to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of the other control methods,
you really need a lot better knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecology of the pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, you need a good sense of the
relationship between the density of that
[SPEAKER_00]: pest and the damage or impact that they
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that it takes a
certain number of pests to reach that
[SPEAKER_00]: economic injury level, something I'm sure
you're all familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: When possible, you hope to have a decent
sampling protocol to determine really if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are close to this economic injury
level and whether it's worth using some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of control tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've listed here several control
tactics that are useful in small fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical is certainly our most common
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological control I think is quite
important in small fruit crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if we don't really recognize that to
be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Host plant resistance can be important for
arthropod pests and particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cultural practices that growers
can do to reduce pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to review some of these for
each of the pests I cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what pests should we look at?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just go through the list of the
Cornell guidelines and listed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: insect pests for blueberries, raspberries,
or cane fruit and strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: I come up with a list like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, there's about 20 or 25 pests
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certainly many more pests that
I could include.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is way more than I could cover in
a 50-minute conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's probably more than you
need to know much about because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely to see all of these pests as
important economic pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I try to do is let's focus in on
the two or maybe three pests in each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those three major small fruit crops that
you're likely to see in visiting grower
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you get phone calls about some
problem, these are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to show up that having some base
knowledge of would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get some of these other insects
showing up and maybe then you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to refer to some of these resources
or give me a call or send me an email to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if we can sort it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the ones in yellow in this slide
are the pests I'm going to try to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with strawberry pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about three different
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Laura and I came up with some what
she calls poll questions that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: presented to you as I get to the end of
each of these pests just to, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if I've done a good job actually of
explaining things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can answer the questions correctly,
then I guess I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to give you something else to do
besides just listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is the first pest I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably pretty familiar to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult stage here is on the left on the
strawberry fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the immature stage on the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right is a damaged fruit
caused by the feeding of this adult and
[SPEAKER_00]: immature, something called cat face.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably familiar to most of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've worked in strawberries,
this is tarnished plant bug, a true bug in
[SPEAKER_00]: the order hemiptera,
[SPEAKER_00]: an important pest in strawberries as well
as a lot of other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this diagram I have up now is a way
that I want to go over the life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of these pests I'm focused in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top, I'm going to have,
let's see, let me see if I can get used to
[SPEAKER_00]: using this pointer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on this top, I'm going to have the kind
of time during the summer, spring to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the left side, different
stages of the insect or mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to focus in on sort of what
the pattern is and how many generations
[SPEAKER_00]: they have in the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for tarnished plant bug, they
overwinter as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwintering in hedgerows, under larger
weeds, and this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get active as temperatures get going
in the morning, or excuse me, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, maybe above 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mate and actually start laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will move into strawberries to lay
eggs and to feed and also a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant species, particularly weed species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that more in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through two to three generations
during the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this overwintered adults,
they lay eggs that produce the nymphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the immature stage that become adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go through a second
generation and sometimes a third
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much temperature there
is during field season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important, sort of how they
overwinter and what time of the season
[SPEAKER_00]: they get going in terms of managing the
pest in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go forward then and just highlight
some of the biological details I think are
[SPEAKER_00]: important to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two to three generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a broad host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got one of the largest host ranges of
different plants that it feeds on any
[SPEAKER_00]: insect that has been studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having trouble grabbing my pointer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also feeds on a lot of these host
plants are weedy species and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important as we come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Laura's putting up one of
the first questions that you should have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That life cycle diagram that I presented
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this timing right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll try to do this better as we go along
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to close that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I can just move on,
right Laura?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so it's an important pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused this damage that really is quite
expensive for a high value crop like
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have some method of
evaluating its abundance in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here I'm thinking about primarily June
bearing strawberries, but you can also use
[SPEAKER_00]: the sampling techniques in day neutral
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the June bearing strawberries,
the most useful stage of the insect to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor is the nymph stage, the immature
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a tapping technique that works
quite well for this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have explained this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't see this and you can just go on
and I can put it back actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something happened to the slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pan is put underneath the
inflorescence and you tap it against the
[SPEAKER_00]: pan and the nymphs fall off in this white
pan and you can readily count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For June bearing strawberries,
it's the nymphs that probably cause the
[SPEAKER_00]: most damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults, they're not very abundant and
are probably not doing the major part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nymphs, however, they feed on the
young fruit and that feeding on the young
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and medium-aged fruit causes that
cat-facing that we don't want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a pretty well worked out
sampling program that uses this pan
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's summarized here in this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be starting at the beginning of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a pretty easy strategy and I
think it's helpful if growers do this
[SPEAKER_00]: because tarnished plant bug is variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is abundant in some years and not in
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense for a grower to know
whether it's worth spraying or not based
[SPEAKER_00]: on monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's pretty quick to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protocols involve sampling three
inflorescences at five locations and
[SPEAKER_00]: estimating the average number of nymphs
per inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've calculated that the economic
threshold would be about a half a nymph
[SPEAKER_00]: per inflorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above that, you're causing enough damage
to the fruit that it's having an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, costing the grower at least as
much or more than a spray to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another way to look at it,
it's a little quicker without keeping,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to keep track of actual
counts, is a presence-absence approach in
[SPEAKER_00]: which you would count the number of
inflorescences that have one or more nymph
[SPEAKER_00]: out of 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get four or more, that's
considered beyond the threshold and that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worth treating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monitoring, if you can train growers to
do this, is a helpful cost-saving thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so I've talked about monitoring and
the kind of impact that the tarnished
[SPEAKER_00]: plant bug can have on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some control techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one is cultural management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is maybe the most important for
June-varying strawberries anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because tarnished plant bugs can feed on
so many different hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them are weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're attracted to weeds or
reproducing on weeds, these provide
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoirs for the bug to move on to
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so keeping the fields weed-free as
possible is helpful in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, reducing competition with
strawberries and removing a reservoir for
[SPEAKER_00]: tarnished plant bug and certainly some
diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm sure you're all aware,
weed management is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although given that it's difficult to
achieve in strawberries often,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I think Marvin Pritz talked about a few
sessions ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that might be helpful in
managing strawberries is using host plant
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance based on the cultivar selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growers may not jump on this one
because they're going to make decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: about cultivar selection based on a lot of
other things, in particular, marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have found that cultivars that
mature early in the season tend to escape
[SPEAKER_00]: damage from tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And highly productive cultivars,
things like honey oint, to some extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: jewel, tend to spread the damage out on
the different fruits to an extent that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see as much of that cap-facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they, in essence, tolerate the
plant bug at a higher density.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two cultural approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think weed management is probably the
most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is biological control going on in
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several parasitoid wasps that
attack either the egg or the nymphal
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there is a species introduced
about 15 years ago now called Peristina
[SPEAKER_00]: digonudis that is a specialist on
tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a nice picture here of a
female piercing the abdomen of a nymph
[SPEAKER_00]: tarnished plant bug and inserting her egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this species has spread widely in New
York and other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be having an impact on
tarnished plant bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very sensitive to pesticides,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more growers can use selective
compounds or not spray in their fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better this parasitoid and many other
natural enemies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, chemical control, there are several
options for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just have them listed here on this
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm not going to spend a lot
of time on the chemical control options
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I think it's pretty available
for you and the grower in terms of our
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here are the ones that are listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, on the top of these lists that
I'm going to give you, I'll focus on maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the broader spectrum materials,
the ones that tend to have more negative
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences for natural enemies,
but also tend to be quite effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the bottom, I'll be providing maybe
some organic options, like on the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of this list, pyranone, which is a
short-lived organic version of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrethroid that is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's short-lived, you've got
to use it frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is what I want to talk about
in terms of tarnished plant bug on
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to mention, though,
I said that it had a lot of other hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, including some small fruit,
other small fruit crops, it is a pest of
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries as well as strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one that comes up there,
although I'm not going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of the principles I discussed
here are relevant for raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, my second strawberry pest is shown
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult here on the left and the
immature stage that lives in the soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle and the root crown of
strawberry with a hole in it, if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that, where a larva has caused some
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the root weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually several species of
the root weevil that can be a serious pest
[SPEAKER_00]: of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years it's a pest, other years it's
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some farms have more problems with than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be a tricky one because what
you often can find in severe cases is you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see the insect, but you see that the
field is in decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its vigor is reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up seeing a lot of extra weeds
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a field where they've had a
serious problem with root weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are basically dying on you,
probably because there's so much damage to
[SPEAKER_00]: that crown of the plant that it can't get
the nutrients and water that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so strawberry, there's several species
of root weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: One most common that we deal with is the
smallest one on this diagram, the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry root weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two other species,
a little bit larger, the rough strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: root weevil and the black vine weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black vine, you'll probably run into
it feeding seeds on a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real problem in nurseries and
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look about the same, except they
differ in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life cycle of root weevils,
they all have pretty similar life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult emerges from the soil in late
May and over into June and even into early
[SPEAKER_00]: July.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big spread in the species do
differ a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, I make a distinction
here between the adult pre-reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and the adult reproductive stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because when adults first come
out, they do not start laying eggs for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to feed for several weeks,
then they start mating and then start
[SPEAKER_00]: laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important in terms of timing
of control measures, and I'll come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get this pointer working,
Laura, and I just can't seem to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have to keep it on and then drag
it around, and you do have to keep going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let your finger off it,
I think you have to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, there it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try again the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to work this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have one generation a year,
root weevils do, and they kind of enter
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in mid to late summer as larvae,
spend the winter that way, are larger
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae in the spring and then come out to
restart the cycle in the next mid summer
[SPEAKER_00]: time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to the next slide and
see if I can get my pointer back.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple points to make in terms of the
biology, ecology of this insect that are
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one generation per year is always
helpful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults are flightless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elytra, that first generation,
the first set of wings is actually fused
[SPEAKER_00]: on this beetle so it can't fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mentioned this significant what I
call pre-over position period or period
[SPEAKER_00]: before the adults start laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, how do you know if you have a
root weevil problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one is, as I mentioned, the loss of
vigor in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the first thing to notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, many things can cause loss of
vigor, so how do you know if it's root
[SPEAKER_00]: weevil?
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is to dig up crowns of strawberry
plants that are looking a little bit weak
[SPEAKER_00]: and look for the white grubs, the larval
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the later summer, they're actually
quite small and hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, they've gotten bigger and
they're a little easier to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way and probably a good way
to start doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way that's important is look for
activity of the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, they have a real
characteristic feeding damage involving
[SPEAKER_00]: notching of the leaves on the outside like
shown here and down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults will show this damage and it's
one way to sort of get a first sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is to actually try to catch
the adults in pitfall traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cup-like structures put into the
ground at soil level with some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: solution in there, typically antifreeze or
soapy water, and then you cover this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with a shingle and the adults,
which are nocturnal during the daytime,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go in here and hide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fall into the pit and you can look
for them then.
[SPEAKER_00]: For growers, I think maybe the easiest two
things would be to dig up plants to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for grubs and look for this feeding of
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeding of adults is important because
of that pre-oval position period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, some control tactics then.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is to rotate out of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a site that has root weevil problems
for one to two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that helpful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the root weevil is flightless and
it's not going to fly over to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will walk over to the next planting,
however, so it's important to establish a
[SPEAKER_00]: new planting at least 500 meters away from
the old planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some people have even tried
putting physical barriers between an
[SPEAKER_00]: infested planting that you're leaving or
abandoning and a new planting and catching
[SPEAKER_00]: the beetles and preventing them from
gaining access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's had some success in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried it myself to see how well
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is biological control for root
weevil targeted on the grubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This involves animal pathic nematodes that
infect the larval stage, reproduce inside
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and then release thousands and
thousands of infective juice juvenile
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes that can then infect other
larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: These nematodes are commercially available
and there's a couple species we note in
[SPEAKER_00]: our guidelines that seem to be
particularly effective against root
[SPEAKER_00]: weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two time periods to try to release
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in the later summer, early fall,
where you're going after those immature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the younger stage of the immature root
weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to kill them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nematodes can do that in the fall and
they should overwinter and then be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective again in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can try releasing the nematodes in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I haven't done much with nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: An entomologist at the University of
Connecticut's field station, agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: station, has had some success with these
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Rich Cowles and I think it's
worth trying for some of our growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for a while we actually had no good
chemical controls for adults and so
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes was really our only approach and
or rotating out of the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do now have a couple materials that are
labeled for control and that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted against the pre-overpositional
period that I talked about in that
[SPEAKER_00]: midsummer period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's important to know when the
adults are first coming out, maybe waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: a week or 10 days and then applying the
insecticide to try to kill those adults
[SPEAKER_00]: before they lay eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that leads us to our next poll
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if everybody could try to
answer that question to the best of their
[SPEAKER_01]: ability, we're going to see how well you
were listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a way to kind of test the
interactivity and try to keep people on
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody voted?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the answer right on the slide,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that may have been me.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's useful knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to a third pest that's
really creating some problems for
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a picture of the adult on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a brown beetle in the family
nididoolidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite small.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle, you get a sense of the
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an adult on the head of a dime and
it's not much bigger than the nose of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure who this person is on the
dime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is the larval stage of
this beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both the adult and the larval stage feed
on the fruit and particularly the larval
[SPEAKER_00]: stage is problematic because, especially
in you-pick situations, because people
[SPEAKER_00]: picking fruit don't see the larvae,
they're kind of hidden, and they bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them home, they make jams and jellies out
of it, and see these little white grubs
[SPEAKER_00]: floating to the top and that creates all
sorts of problems that growers have to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain to their customers about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the strawberry sap beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is overwintering as the adult stage,
again in hedgerows, along wood edges,
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of thing, the adults get active
early in the season as temperatures warm
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin to feed and probably mate,
and they may do a little bit of egg laying
[SPEAKER_00]: in the woods, along the edges of woods,
but where it becomes a problem for our
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry growers is that the adults move
into the strawberry patch and begin
[SPEAKER_00]: significant feeding and reproducing,
which gets a lot of the larvae going that
[SPEAKER_00]: can contaminate the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strawberry sap beetle will get one
generation on strawberries, or potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: any other fruit that flowers that early,
and then they pupate in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: emerge in midsummer, and then do a second
generation on other types of fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: then going on to their overwintering stage
again at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this problem, the sap beetle,
such a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of some of their biology that
makes it really difficult to treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is they don't overwinter
in the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overwinter typically in the wood
edges, and they only move into the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry patch as the fruit's ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the time that growers want to open up
their fields for picking, they've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: pest moving in there that they may need to
spray for if that'll work, but it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: not a very convenient time to do that,
so it's really tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Related to that is actually, and I'll
mention this later, is the beetle is very
[SPEAKER_00]: secretive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It likes to hide underneath the fruit or
in the straw of strawberry, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually hard to get at with an
insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part of their biology that I think
is important is that they, in that second
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, will feed on the residue and
coal piles from a lot of other fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, including the cherry, blueberry,
raspberry, melons, and probably some other
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits as well that we haven't started to
study, and though they're not particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: a pest on these other fruit, because they
typically stay on the ground to feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit, so it's just fruit that's
fallen down to the ground and not really
[SPEAKER_00]: of use to the grower, they can build up
large populations on this residue fruit to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwinter, then come in the next year,
higher populations can infest the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means one approach to controlling
this pest is good sanitation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry field as well as for the
residue of these other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I bring this up in a lot of grower
meetings I have, talking to strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who are really frustrated with
this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those growers that have it are at
wit's end because it is a really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: one, a really challenging pest to control,
and I mentioned, well, sanitation is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably your best approach, and I think
they rightfully say, look it, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to do a clean sanitation of
strawberry fields, especially you pick
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't know exactly how many customers
will come, you can't keep them from
[SPEAKER_00]: standing on the fruit and creating all
sorts of damaged berries that these
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles like, so it's really tricky,
and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you can say is to do the best they
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they can do a little bit better
job maybe on the residue from some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other fruit crops especially those
growers, and a lot of our growers do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that have multiple fruit on their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something like peaches, if a lot of
peaches are falling on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting those up periodically and
burying them might be a useful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with one grower who used to
collect his old peaches and melons and
[SPEAKER_00]: just pile them in a big coal pile exposed,
and he had, you know, sure, thousands if
[SPEAKER_00]: not hundreds of thousands of sap beetles
using those residue fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For reproduction at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's something that can be
done that might help the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is particularly true as our
farmers are diversifying and growing so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different crops, some of which can be
fed on by this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably my best strategy,
but there is also some chemical control
[SPEAKER_00]: options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tricky, as I mentioned though,
because of the secretive nature of these
[SPEAKER_00]: beetles and also that you have to wait
till the the fruit is ripening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field before the beetles are even present.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two pyrethroid insecticides
labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that brigade has a zero days to
harvest, whereas danitol has two days to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for a lot of growers that zero
days to harvest is a more useful number
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get in their spray and then be
picking that afternoon, at least 12 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's the last of the strawberry
pests I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might have another poll
question for you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing on time here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are finishing it, but I think we're all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna move into
blueberries now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have, I only have two pests I
really want to talk about in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries is not as large a commodity in
New York as strawberries, and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, in the research side of things and
even the extension side, we don't have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much information or tools developed for
the pest in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, there's a couple key pests
that we deal with in New York that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth going over.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, it's actually two species,
but they have very similar biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I've combined them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult shown here on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the damage in the larva of one of
the species shown here in the middle on
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries, and then the second species,
the larval stage and the damage from the
[SPEAKER_00]: second species shown on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all fruit worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on the left is the cranberry fruit
worm, and the one, larva on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a picture of the adult,
is the cherry fruit worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, little closeups of the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of diagnostic, of the two
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cranberry fruit worm tends to feed on
several berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a messy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a lot of frass and webbing and
stuff, whereas the cherry fruit worm tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay within a single berry and not show
such significant symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's our life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty similar for both species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overwinter as late in star larvae and
then pupate in the spring and come out at
[SPEAKER_00]: around bloom time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult flight is over about a
three-week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing depends on temperature and things
like that, and they have one generation
[SPEAKER_00]: per year causing the damage I just showed
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, review of the biology details that
are helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overwinter as late in star larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult flight starts at around end of bloom
time, one generation per year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then some differences between
cranberry fruit worm and cherry fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: worm, which I discussed previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so how does a grower know
they've got problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What scouting protocols do we have
available?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the fruit worms, we have pheromone
traps to monitor the timing of adult
[SPEAKER_00]: flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can provide some important
information on when growers might consider
[SPEAKER_00]: applying some sort of control measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can give you a little information
whether you have fruit worm or don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit worm, but its best use is for
timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pheromone trap is shown here in a
picture here that Molly Shaw loaned me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is, it's baited with a sex
pheromone for the specific fruit worm
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a pheromone for cranberry fruit
worm and a pheromone for cherry fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males are attracted to the pheromone
and they get stuck on the sticky material.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably our best and most
effective way for monitoring for the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of these fruit worm pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to mention that our most common
species in our area is the cranberry fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: worm, CFW in this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cherry fruit worm is not as common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one has a pheromone and you need to
use the pheromones in separate traps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but our focus typically in New York has
been on the cranberry fruit worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look for eggs in the very
young fruit after fruit sets occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes some training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I show a picture of the two different
species of egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while you can figure out how
to do it, but I don't think it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful tool for most growers without some
very specific training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Molly Shaw when she did her study
last year, she did take time to show
[SPEAKER_00]: growers how to do this and I think she was
able to train some to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cranberry fruit worm is one of our two
significant pests in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big pest in some other blueberry
growing areas, Michigan, New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore there are actually quite a
few pesticides labeled for their use and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed them in this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The factors that I think that growers need
to keep in mind though, and I'm sure they
[SPEAKER_00]: do because they know how important
pollination is in blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: is whether the materials they're using are
safe for bees or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the compounds, especially the
broad-spectrum compounds listed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not safe for bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you need to wait till after
petal fall to put an application on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of them like the BT, Bacillus
thuringiensis, and the Spintor spinocid
[SPEAKER_00]: product, Spintor and Trust, are pretty
safe for bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have some reason to think the
opposition is starting in parts of your
[SPEAKER_00]: planting while flowering is still going
on, you could use those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Laura, I think that I'm at the end
of the fruit worm discussion, so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if we had a question for fruit worms
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one question, Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the column for be safe where it says
Spintor, it says that Spintor is not be
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yeah, thank you, Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of these things that,
that's right, thank you for clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not safe until it dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I have a no there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, if you time it right,
spray at night, you can use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is not safe when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can open up this poll if you'd like me
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks wouldn't mind just reading that and
voting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might be trickier to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's move on to the second key
blueberry pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left here is a picture of the adult
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's about to ovipod egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: That egg hatches into a larva that feeds
on the interior of the blueberry and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually drops out of that blueberry to
go to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This course is the blueberry maggot fly,
a pretty significant pest, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: states that do a lot of blueberries for
retail where the tolerance for blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: maggot is basically zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, where we have a lot of you
pick systems, we actually can tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: some blueberry maggot because the damaged
berries often drop off or the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are picking the fruit throw them away or
aren't so concerned about a few kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dinged up berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the retail people that really have a
problem with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, the blueberry mat can be
abundant enough in New York to warrant
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here's the life cycle of
blueberry maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just one generation a year for this
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It overwinters, as I mentioned,
in the soil and really doesn't start
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the pupal stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until mid late summer when you start to
start seeing some ripening in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults actually have, again,
one of these pre-over position periods
[SPEAKER_00]: where for about 10 days they have to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start mating and laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fairly protracted emergence of
adults from the soil so that once you
[SPEAKER_00]: start getting adults out, even though an
individual adult might only live for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple weeks, you keep getting new adults
coming out from the soil so that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries out, excuse me, the blueberry
maggot flies out for most of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to figure out this green pointer
but I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's your life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the review, one generation per
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overwinter as pupae in the soil below
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this prolonged emergence from
June to August.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a significant pre-over position
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you'd guess, that's an important factor
for control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually lay one egg per berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often are common in wild or abandoned
blueberries, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a wild patch of blueberries near up
commercial operation increases the risk
[SPEAKER_00]: from blueberry maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitoring for blueberry maggot is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some well-developed tools for
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use of a yellow sticky card,
you've probably all dealt with this in one
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstance or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a yellow card coated with a sticky
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty attractive to the adult maggot
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, you can add feeding
stimulants to the card that makes it even
[SPEAKER_00]: more attractive so that the flies,
especially in this pre-over positional
[SPEAKER_00]: period where they're hungry and looking
for protein food, are attracted to the
[SPEAKER_00]: card with the attractant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attractant being protein hydrosolate
and ammonium acetate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly Shaw got Lomi some pictures again
showing these traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a close-up of a trap that she brought
in from the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Note that the traps, I'm sure you've
experienced, collect all sorts of flies
[SPEAKER_00]: and other kinds of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be pretty good at being able
to identify the blueberry maggot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has that very characteristic
markings on the wing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to think of these traps is that
they're an early warning system for
[SPEAKER_00]: determining when you need to start
worrying about control of blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: maggots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a problem with blueberry
maggots or a grower has a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry maggots, knowing when that start
of the emergence is important,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically our prescription then is you
need to start spraying an insecticide like
[SPEAKER_00]: malathion and continue to spray really for
the remainder of the summer every seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that prolonged emergence of the
blueberry maggot from the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get a sum, you will continually
see them through the rest of the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several products labeled for
blueberry maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything particular to
mention here except to again point out
[SPEAKER_00]: that what you're trying to do with this
spray is to get it on before you get egg
[SPEAKER_00]: laying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's important, just like with
those root weevils, to determine when the
[SPEAKER_00]: start of the flight is in order to better
time your sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Laura, I think that's it for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wait, wait, I can't ask this question
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I won't open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I didn't mention
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and open it up, Laura,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that blueberries are,
wild blueberries are an important source
[SPEAKER_00]: for blueberry maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned it's important to get an
early warning system for the emergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry maggots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is that in the commercial
blueberry patch, there's a delay in when
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberry maggots make it there,
so they're probably emerging from the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of blueberries, and it takes
them a few days to make it over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the opportunity, a grower,
it's helpful to put a trap near a wild
[SPEAKER_00]: planting of blueberries so that you can
identify the immediate start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergence of the blueberries instead of
losing a couple days information so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be starting to put your
insecticide on too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna talk about raspberries now to
finish this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna talk about a couple pests and
raspberries that, I mean, there's a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of insects that feed on raspberries,
and it's hard to pick which ones are more
[SPEAKER_00]: important than others, but I focused in on
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's kind of a fruit pest, leaf pest,
and the other one's an important cane and
[SPEAKER_00]: root pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the first one is this beetle shown
on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called the raspberry fruit worm,
so it's got that fruit worm name again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's actually a beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds on the flower buds of raspberries
and on the leaves shown in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: picture here, causing this kind of
stripped look to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lays its eggs near a flower bud or
opening flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eggs hatch, and the larvae get inside
and feed on the bud and fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often starting merging for pupation about
the time harvest occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is for the summer fruiting
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a second pest, one I'm not
gonna focus in on because the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: control for the raspberry fruit worm is
the same as for the sawfly, but I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to point it out because it actually causes
damage pretty similar on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is raspberry sawfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into raspberry fields,
you almost always see some of this leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding damage shown on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they fed and made holes in the
interior part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raspberry fruit worm causes similar
damage, although they tend to strip the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf out to the margins of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a sawfly tends to be more in the
interior of the leaf, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: similar looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: The immature stage of the sawfly is shown
on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this green worm-like thing that's got
these kind of whitish hairs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fairly easy to find if you see the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The raspberry sawfly, it can get bad
enough to cause economic damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but often it's just cosmetic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the chemical control if you have
to deal with raspberry fruit worm is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same and the timing is the same for
raspberry sawfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on this raspberry fruit worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually two species, one on the
west coast called the western raspberry
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit worm and then our species on the
east.
[SPEAKER_00]: It overwinters in the soil as a pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, it gets active in the
spring and the adults come out and they
[SPEAKER_00]: feed on those flower buds and maybe
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Begin laying eggs and you get that larva
one generation during the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can be abundant and because they
attack the fruit in addition to the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, they can be a serious pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, the larvae start coming out
about the time you're harvesting and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really want to get those larvae
dropping out in the basket of raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider one of our more important pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't admit this, but I don't work a
lot in raspberries, but I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: actually seen this pest in raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a planting here on the station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't found it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been to a field that has it,
but I certainly know talking to growers
[SPEAKER_00]: that some areas have problems with this
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: One generation a year, can be a problem in
some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have in terms of controlling
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the most effective of course
is using fall maturing raspberries that
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to kind of escape this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fruit buds out available on
fall bearing raspberries so that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: really no concern for it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of chemical control, I guess the
two points I wanted to make is one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the timing for this should be before
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The compounds we have can be, or are
harmful to pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to use it pre bloom time
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also the time when you can kill
the adults before they've had a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: lay a lot of eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Eastern raspberry fruit worm
pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I admit, I haven't really seen around
New York, but can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go into my next couple of pests,
do we have a poll question?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have everybody voting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to finish up with a couple
of important pests in raspberries that
[SPEAKER_00]: attack the canes and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one shown here, it's a beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually kind of a handsome beetle,
I think, shown over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females lay their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults don't really do much damage,
but the females lay their eggs in a
[SPEAKER_00]: actively growing stem of a sort of
primocane type raspberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg hatches and the larvae burrow into
the stem, into the pith.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process of laying the eggs,
the females girdle the stem and it causes
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem to kind of wilt over like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae, as I said, burrow into the
pith, heading downward into the cane and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually reaching the crown area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called the raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a second species of cane borer
like species I'm not going to mention
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just focusing on this raspberry cane
borer, which we often see in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings of raspberry, particularly this
damage to the shoot tips during the
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often will find some of this in a lot of
plantings I go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty serious pest if you get
an abundance of them and they get down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second cane and root pest I want to
mention is this insect shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the left, you might look at this
and say, oh, that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the adult stage and in fact,
it is a moth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the raspberry crown borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mimic of a wasp that's used as a
defense to keep it from being eaten by
[SPEAKER_00]: birds, but it actually lays an egg and
gets a larva out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little brown guy lays on raspberry
leaves and weed species around the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: a raspberry plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg hatches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets along the bottom part of the cane
hatching and burrowing into the cane and
[SPEAKER_00]: down into the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get these huge larvae in there by
the second year that get to be over like
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch, inch and a half long in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this feeding into the crown,
they cause a collapse of that cane and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe several canes that might be coming
near that crown and killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a pretty serious problem if
this happens where you're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: knocking out that whole system for fruit
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the life cycle of the cane
borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first introduced the raspberry cane
borer, showed you what the symptoms look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I showed you the raspberry crown
borer, that moth that mimics a wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so those are the two pests I want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to jump back to the
raspberry cane borer and just talk more
[SPEAKER_00]: about its biology and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll finish up then with the raspberry
crown borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cane borer first, then crown borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the confusion, they should
rename these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've combined them because they're
both kind of pests of canes and crowns of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adult comes out in early summer,
late spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's around for a long time period,
actually, in which it mates and lays eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: that cause that characteristic shoot
wilting that I showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The eggs hatch and they burrow into the
cane, and they probably spend that first
[SPEAKER_00]: year in the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They overwinter that way, and then they
have a second year in the cane where they
[SPEAKER_00]: go further down towards the roots or
crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend a second winter in that
position, and then in the spring of their
[SPEAKER_00]: third year, actually, they pupate and
start the cycle over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got two years that it spends in
the cane as an immature stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it spends most of its life as an
immature and a relatively short time as an
[SPEAKER_00]: adult, a couple months during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the problem with raspberry cane
borers, once it gets down into the cane,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really, actually, we have no
insecticides even labeled for its use in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our primary way to deal with this pest
is to focus in on the symptoms of damage
[SPEAKER_00]: during the season and try to get rid of
them before they have a chance to get very
[SPEAKER_00]: far down into the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a cultural control that
goes along with monitoring for this very
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to point this out again,
if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the girdling that the female does
above and below the egg scar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg is in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why they do this, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they may affect the movement of phloem
in the shoot or something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of this girdling, you get this
tipping over of the shoot fairly quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: after the elbow position event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one important way and good way to try
to control this pest is to go around and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor for this damage and cut it out of
the planting below this second girdle line
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere down here and destroying these
girdled shoot tips, thereby destroying the
[SPEAKER_00]: larva and preventing it from successfully
gaining access to a larger part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a somewhat labor-intensive
procedure and one that I think growers
[SPEAKER_00]: will tend to ignore early in the
infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time it's gotten to be
really bad, they're noticing that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: canes are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having problems in the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost impossible to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've certainly had growers that have
had to kind of abandon plantings because
[SPEAKER_00]: of this raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So management of raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's focused all on cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the season, monitoring and removing
these girdled shoot tips a few inches
[SPEAKER_00]: below that bottom girdle line is,
I think, the smartest thing, the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the winter, identifying these canes
that have died on you and pulling them out
[SPEAKER_00]: during the dormant season and destroying
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get the larvae that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably both those approaches is
important, especially if the plant is in
[SPEAKER_00]: an area with a lot of wild brambles and
therefore a bigger population of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower could try removing wild brambles
near their planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this works or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is anecdotal observations that
suggest it might be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, in New York, there are no
chemicals labeled to control this pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess if one had a chemical,
it would probably have to target the adult
[SPEAKER_00]: during that early and midsummer period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, quiz time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are really paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That question was kind of ambiguous,
so you did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's the raspberry cane borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pretty quickly go over the raspberry
crown borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, maybe even a more
significant pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be quite destructive in
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, pictures to remind you,
the adult here on the right, it's a moth
[SPEAKER_00]: that mimics a wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a pretty mature couple of larvae
here that are at the base of canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how much feeding damage
they can do to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life cycle of this pest is also fairly
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the adults actually come out
later in the season, late July,
[SPEAKER_00]: early August in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pretty easy to observe if
there's a high population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they're very colorful,
that yellow and black.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not particularly skittish as
insects go because they mimic this wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't like to pick up
wasps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tend to be very visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's one way to monitor for,
just to look for the adults, they begin
[SPEAKER_00]: laying egg on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eggs on foliage, I think an adult can lay
50 or so eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae hatch and they go to the base
of the cane and they just stay on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the cane, building a structure
they call, I think it's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they hang out the base of the raspberry
cane and then penetrate the cane the
[SPEAKER_00]: following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then move down into the crown and
roots where they spend the whole year and
[SPEAKER_00]: the next winter and then finish up their
development during that third year and
[SPEAKER_00]: come out as adults to start the cycle
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a large part of this insect's
life, it's spent very well hidden inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the canes and crowns of raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, this can be a pretty
destructive pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some examples of some collapsed
canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we often see in a planting that's got
problems is that second and third year,
[SPEAKER_00]: the second year particularly, really puts
a lot of stress on the plant, the shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: are up, but just about the time they're
trying to set fruit or mature fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cane just collapses on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty common observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go down to the base of those
canes and you rip up the crown,
[SPEAKER_00]: you often find those big grubs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this pest, if it gets abundant,
can destroy a planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our management techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we have both cultural and
chemical approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural, like the raspberry canebore,
is to remove those dying canes and crowns,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, during the dormant season,
in order to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull them out and you destroy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one approach, really one of our
main approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, possibly removing wild brambles can
reduce populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry crownbore is a host specialist,
so it's only feeding on raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get rid of that reservoir of
raspberry, you might be able to help
[SPEAKER_00]: manage pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have chemical control options,
and we only got this quite recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been in the last couple years
that we had an insecticide labeled against
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberry crownbore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this insecticide is targeted against
the young, immature larva before it
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates the cane or the base of the
cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember I told you that the egg
hatches and the larva kind of hangs out at
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside of the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do a drench spray of this
insecticide on the bottom part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cane, around the crown, where you're
spraying, target this immature,
[SPEAKER_00]: either in the fall, after it's got
established, or in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: before it really has time to penetrate the
cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen some efficacy data suggesting
this is a fairly good way to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the fall application working a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, can I interrupt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see the question from Molly Shaw?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molly Shaw, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molly, I'm going to read this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, everybody can see it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'll still read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unlike the strawberry crownbore,
if there are raspberry crownbores present,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will always be wilted shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Molly, I'm not sure if you meant the
strawberry crownbore or I'm not sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: you mean by strawberry crownbore,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some strawberry pests that do get
into the crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're referring to,
I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK, the root weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, maybe that first year of
an infestation, you might not see the
[SPEAKER_00]: collapse of these canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's with the crownbore.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the raspberry canebore, you always
see that wilted shoot tip above that
[SPEAKER_00]: girdled mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the canebore, you get that wilted
shoot that is a clear diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic, and you always get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For crownbore, you know, I honestly am not
100% sure how long that takes before you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that collapsing cane, where the whole
cane collapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also see this collapsing cane with
raspberry canebore after that full year
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's spent in the cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the canebore, initially you get the
wilted shoot tip because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overposition and girdling, and then later
on, the next year probably, or maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of that year, you'll get a collapsing
cane because the larva is now penetrated
[SPEAKER_00]: and burrowed down into the pith.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the crownbore, you won't see much of
that initial spring when the larva
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates, but maybe by the end of that
season or the next season, you'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing collapsing canes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that answers your question,
Molly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura, do we have a last question for him?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last one you guys have to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two people may have stepped away a little
bit there, but we'll close that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I want to thank you guys for trying
this particular route out with kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: interactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've sort of covered what I see as the key
pests that you might run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the Extension educators
only occasionally deal with fruit pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this talk is best geared to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others of you, like Molly, are working in
fruit a lot, and so this may be somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: well known to Molly and quite a bit of a
review, but for those of you who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: work in it a lot, some of these things are
going to crop up, and maybe this will give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a good handle on helping to diagnose a
problem and pointing a grower in the right
[SPEAKER_00]: direction in terms of dealing with the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a fair number of resources for
you to go to get information.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, you can email or phone me
with questions, have growers call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some of those every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there's a lot of resources
both printed and in the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the backside of that handout,
I've list some of the ones I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this last picture I have for you,
I just kind of grabbed the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin Pritz's berry diagnostic tool,
which many of you are probably familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very useful way to narrow down the
potential problem that you see in a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry, raspberry, or strawberry
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that and some of these other
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, it's about 2.10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where we want to go from
here, Laura, but I'm pretty much done now
[SPEAKER_00]: with the formal part of the presentation.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg, I want to thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great effort at making it more
interactive, and I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody has any questions for Greg,
we might have 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, hopefully we will see most of you
back again on November 19 when we have
[SPEAKER_01]: information about small fruit nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very, very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few people typing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be sending out an evaluation to
those of you that were on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to let you know in advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may be asking some fairly pointed
questions because we are applying for a
[SPEAKER_01]: grant to do a little bit more webcasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would appreciate any comments that
you have that could help us go forward
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you again, Greg, and thank the
rest of you for participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that concludes this Berry webcast.
