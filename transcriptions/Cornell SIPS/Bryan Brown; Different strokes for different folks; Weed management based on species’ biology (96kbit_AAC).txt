[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, gosh, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some, uh, some fun slides to
present today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, I'll just hop right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, different strokes for different
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a phrase coined by Muhammad Ali
talking about how he had different boxing
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies for different opponents based
on their strengths and weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this is a really nice parallel for
what I'm going to be talking about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that weed species are very
different based on their biology and the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we should really be tailoring our
management based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, first off, I want to tell you a
little bit about my position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly extension and I do try to hit
every corner of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I cover all crops, um,
as well as recently added a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I cover, uh, backyard gardens,
uh, and needs in natural landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to start by giving some
examples of, uh, weeds in different
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that, that I've viewed from my
travels, uh, across the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, this is, this is one that kind of
stands out is glyphosate tolerant soybeans
[SPEAKER_00]: where the farmers are really relying on,
on glyphosate to achieve their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, typically the most problematic
weeds in these systems are also tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: of glyphosate, uh, or have developed
resistance to glyphosate, uh, as is the
[SPEAKER_00]: case with tall waterhemp and horseweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In great vineyards, we've, we've
established this great, um, trellis system
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to help our, our perennial,
uh, grapevines thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that there are several
perennial vining weeds that also tend to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, thrive in this environment,
hedge vine weed, Virginia creeper,
[SPEAKER_00]: also poison ivy and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it kind of, it kind of fits
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in greenhouses on benches,
I was happy to work with Betsy of last
[SPEAKER_00]: month to attend and present at the
greenhouse IPM in depth, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there's a very specific set of
weeds in greenhouses on benches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that they have in common
is that they all can't have the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to, um, forcefully eject their seed and
shoot those seeds five or six feet away,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is enough to hop up onto the benches
or in the hanging baskets or from pot to
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so each of these three examples
here, um, I've actually led or co-led,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, trials and have have that,
uh, that data up online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, I also went into detail in my
last horticulture seminar a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's up on the web if you're
interested more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a few other examples of weeds that
have come to thrive in different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is a, a good example here from
our, our AFRI project looking to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve establishment of, of conifers in
the first few years, which can be very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's typically high mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the sets of treatments that
we're looking at is, uh, is with weed
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're comparing cultivation,
which is kind of shallowly disturbing the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're doing this about three times
over the course of the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mowing about once a month,
wood chips, which were applied at about a
[SPEAKER_00]: four inch depth and herbicides,
which were sprayed in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the fall, typically while the
trees were, were still a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's interesting because,
because this is side by side, this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same field and, you know,
a very similar starting point in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: which weeds were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're coming into the third year here,
and we're still taking data and analyzing
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, but just to anecdotally show you
some pictures, uh, and tell the story,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, each of these, these treatments looks
very different nowadays in the third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, with cultivation,
uh, it's, if there is a lot of hairy
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon soga, and this is one of our
fastest weeds to emerge and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, flower and set seed, it's about three
weeks from emergence to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're cultivating every five or six
weeks, that's plenty of time for this weed
[SPEAKER_00]: to complete its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the mowing system, we don't actually
have many weeds per se in this system,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, instead we have a lot of our
seeded cover crop, which is a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses and clovers that are low growing
and require minimal mowing and are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kind of smothering out the other
weed species, it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the wood chip system, this is really
dominated by Canada thistle and quack
[SPEAKER_00]: grass pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and both of these weeds are perennial
with very aggressive root systems and they
[SPEAKER_00]: spread and have a lot of energy embodied
in those root systems so they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, can, can seemingly easily push through
four inches of wood chip mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the herbicide system,
this will look very clean, very weed free,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for the first month or two after the
herbicide applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but those soil applied herbicides do
break down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get some late season weeds that
are able to germinate and come through,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like barnyard grass here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One final systems comparison that shows
more of this type of, uh, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different weed species coming to thrive in
different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, again, we have, and I should mention
this is an organic, uh, winter squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Delicata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have cultivation again,
compared to a black plastic mulch and a
[SPEAKER_00]: straw mulch applied by hand at a very
high, but kind of a standard rate of nine
[SPEAKER_00]: tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as a rolled rye system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a cover crop, a rye cover
crop that is grown over the winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: through the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as roller crimp to terminate it
into a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And midway through the season,
um, most of these are looking pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of weed control and, and crop
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the one at Weyer was,
was the rolled rye system, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, uh, we struggled with for a few
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there may have been some
allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, potentially just colder, more
compacted soils, uh, maybe some nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: immobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, so we struggled with,
with the rye system a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we, we, uh, enacted it in two,
a little bit different ways each year,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, over the two year study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I really wanted to point out
here is, is the differences in the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used a principal components
analysis to help tell the story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to kind of highlight a few
of the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common purse lane was strongly
associated with the cultivation treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, common purse lane is kind of
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it has these very thick waxy leaves
and it's often able to survive cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: by rerouting and taking some of the energy
stored in the leaves and making new roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and common ragweed was strongly
associated with the rolled rye treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others have shown this before and that
the, the ragweed is one of our earliest
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's able to emerge before we roll down
the rye into a suppressive mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter wheat, we don't think of typically
as a weed, but it's a plant out of place
[SPEAKER_00]: in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, interestingly, this was a winter
wheat straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering where this winter wheat
came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and actually most of the time
when I see straw in use, it does bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: a significant amount of grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we were lucky that this was winter
wheat straw rather than oats or spring
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat, because those would have grown very
tall and headed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas winter wheat requires a
vernalization or overwintering period and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and stayed low growing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, there was a lot of smartly,
there are a few different species of smart
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds and they were mixed, uh,
throughout the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there was just generally a
high level of, of smart weed seeds in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil and seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, so just by sheer numbers,
they were able to, to, uh, to make their
[SPEAKER_00]: way through our treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm really showing and trying to
show in all of these examples is something
[SPEAKER_00]: called community assembly theory,
which is more of an ecological principle
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be applied to weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that the, the species that come to
dominate or thrive in a particular field
[SPEAKER_00]: are really a function of what's there to
begin with and which of those species can
[SPEAKER_00]: make their way through various filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the filters can be abiotic like
temperature and climate filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they can be biotic like weed to weed
or plant plant interactions, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of times the strongest
filter is determining the presence of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, you know, which ones survive or not
is human management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the tillage, it's the herbicides that
are used, these really, um, impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: success of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and a nice way to visualize this is
through a Swiss cheese model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may have seen this in a different
context at the height of COVID and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you, you, you want to,
uh, wear a mask, you want to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: social distance, get vaccinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of these things stacking them
together reduces the, the likelihood that
[SPEAKER_00]: a viral article will, will slip through
and, and, uh, as we get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's the same type of principle
with, with weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the differences between weed
species that can impact their success
[SPEAKER_00]: include their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they an annual that produces thousands
of seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they a perennial that is perhaps more
reliant on spread?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we know that the weeds have a growing
point, um, and they are spreading via the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, monocots tend to have a, a growing
point, um, um, a meristem that is
[SPEAKER_00]: protected at the soil line, whereas
dicots, the meristem is up on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, the ends of the shoots and exposed
to things like mowing, flame weeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, or contact herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morphology that, that the height and
spreading nature of weeds is another
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: as is the photosynthesis type,
which can impact the success of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in drought years or wet years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many other traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are down to the molecular
level, like how the species respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the molecular shapes of some
of their mechanisms at the cellular level
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows herbicides to bind and block
particular mechanisms that are important
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the plant metabolize certain
herbicides to simply make them
[SPEAKER_00]: ineffective?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the important factors that
determines the success of different weed
[SPEAKER_00]: species that you may not think about,
or at least I didn't for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: was when do weeds tend to emerge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And different species tend to emerge at
different times of the year, typically
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the accumulation of growing
degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was some work led by Matt Ryan
that I took a piece of and added some
[SPEAKER_00]: review to and showed that, yeah,
some species anyways, like say barnyard
[SPEAKER_00]: grass here, have an emergence peak that
can be targeted by management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, this shaded band here is a
hypothetical emergence peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I have a few different examples
or scenarios of ways farmers might target
[SPEAKER_00]: that peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crop here is represented by these
vertical lines increasing in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the axes represent various direct
controls like herbicides or tillage or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one simple way is to simply consolidate
some of your direct controls during that
[SPEAKER_00]: period when weeds are just emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when weeds are small, they're most
susceptible to direct control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they're the weakest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is to ensure that you have
residual herbicides overlapping during
[SPEAKER_00]: this important period of emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly with residue mulches,
those mulches break down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ensuring that that's applied before the
emergence peak is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting later can help farmers just
simply avoid an emergence peak if they
[SPEAKER_00]: have that flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And planting earlier can get the crop
established and give it a height advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: over the emerging weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fallow period is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think kind of the gold standard,
if the farmer has that flexibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: simply repeatedly till or spray during
that period, to control those emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds without having to worry about
damaging their crop potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a cover crop can achieve a similar
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit more on thinking about
which crops might be used or be adjusted
[SPEAKER_00]: to shift the timing of when weeds emerge
in a particular field.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weeds are emerging in the early
part of the season, if the problematic
[SPEAKER_00]: species like a lot of our summer annuals
emerge around this time, farmers may
[SPEAKER_00]: consider shifting to later planting
periods to avoid that period or use crops
[SPEAKER_00]: like alfalfa or winter cereals that are
established ahead of time and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive advantage through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For mid-season weeds, it's a little
tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer may try to use short season crops
to avoid this peak emergence period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for late season weeds,
which are typically winter annuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier crops will allow the harvest and
get the crop out of the field so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can then take care of the weeds again
without having to worry about putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing we did with this work
was look at the previous literature for
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the species that we were
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of initiate a bit of a virtual
common garden experiment in that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using these models that were created,
which are primarily based on growing
[SPEAKER_00]: degree days, and then plugging in the same
data for each of these models based on
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness zones that are found in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 4A would be like up in the Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7A would be down in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, for most of these, the data
corresponded to what we had found
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it makes sense that there was
about a month, a month and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between when a given species
would be predicted to emerge in a warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: climate versus a cooler climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the kind of literally
perplexing things is that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: models were very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two of these, that can be
explained in that they're winter annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can also be summer annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that they're modeling two
different populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these, like red root pitweed,
these are summer annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's quite a variation with when
the models predicted emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this shows that there are
population level differences in that
[SPEAKER_00]: pigweed in one part of, say, the US or
Europe or wherever may emerge or can be
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted to emerge at one time,
maybe earlier or later than another
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that has to do with the history
of the field and how the selection
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure has played out in the past for
each population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something that going
forward, we'll have to account for if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be using these models to
make recommendations for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's a lot of biological
traits of impact, which weeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: successful and which aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that information is available
in these two fantastic recent books that
[SPEAKER_00]: were published in the past couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our own Antonio Di Tommaso was a co-author
on both of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Manage Weeds on Your Farm was leading
authored by Charles Muller, the late great
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles Muller, who is at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have been just fantastic
resources for educators like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes these tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all of the common weed species
and most of the key biological traits that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to impact their management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I get a call from a farmer about
what should I be doing about this weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: say shatter cane, I can quickly remind
myself what are the pertinent traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the Manage Weeds on Your Farm,
is that online?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's online, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's available for free online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These books have been a huge help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, in this weed
identification and management webinar
[SPEAKER_00]: series that several of us put together
with webinars on weed management for
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses, for broadleaves, for weed
management soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in particular, really lean heavily on
those two books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, some of the slides that I
use were even pre-made by the Di Tommaso
[SPEAKER_00]: group and Terry Marchener in particular
about how to identify various species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just quickly go through a few of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that I did was really try to
boil down the management information even
[SPEAKER_00]: further just to maybe two bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, velvet leaf has these densely
hairy, velvety drooping leaves that
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides a lot of times can just run
right off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's issues with uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be controlled effectively when
there's four leaves or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And velvet leaf doesn't typically produce
seeds until the end of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for shorter season or earlier season
crops, again, we can try to harvest those
[SPEAKER_00]: early and then come through and
effectively till or burn down the
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining velvet leaf to prevent weed seed
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burrow cucumber can be problematic in
field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks somewhat similar to our
cultivated cucumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these large seeds that enable it to
emerge from rather deep in the plow layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our seeds just emerge in the top
inch or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm calling an Achilles heel or
something that kind of sticks out about
[SPEAKER_00]: each species is that for a burrow
cucumber, it doesn't produce very much
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds last a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's relatively little or few
numbers of burrow cucumber emerging in a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good candidate for spot
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pig weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have several pigweed species in New
York, and two of them are resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: different herbicide classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the pigweed species, I think one of
the important Achilles heels is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds don't live very long in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a half life of about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a farmer is really able to step up
their control for about four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should be able to almost completely
eliminate the pigweed from the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: First lane I mentioned earlier has very
thick back seed leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very low growing, and it's
relatively shade intolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's susceptible to crop competition
from crops like corn and smothering via
[SPEAKER_00]: other means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crabgrass also is fairly low growing and
spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's in a lawn competing with more
erect grasses, if you're able to keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing height higher, it can kind of shift
the competitive advantage to those other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barnyard grass has seed that unlike some
of our grasses or other weed species where
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed almost immediately drops to the
soil and is incorporated into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank, barnyard grass kind of retains
its seed a little bit longer and through
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could potentially be removed through
several different mechanisms, either hand
[SPEAKER_00]: removal or mechanized harvest time weed
seed destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horseweed can be a winter or summer
annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier it is likely resistant
to glyphosate around the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some other herbicide classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has these very, very small seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds are windblown, unlike a lot of
our agricultural weeds that have seed that
[SPEAKER_00]: just drops straight to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horseweed seeds are tiny in order to be
windblown and to be taken by the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're so small, they don't have
enough energy to push through very much
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically only germinate and emerge
from basically the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very susceptible to tillage or
soil disturbance to put them deeper or
[SPEAKER_00]: crop residue or mulches to prevent their
successful emergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common burdock and spotted knapweed are
both biennials and typically only see them
[SPEAKER_00]: in very minimally managed hay fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some perennials, Canada thistle,
field vineweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: quackgrass, and yellow nutsedge are all
perennials with very aggressively
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these species, they store a lot of
energy and carbohydrates in those roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can take many years of repeated
management to effectively control these
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One tip that's good to know and that's
typically suggested is that farmers use
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic herbicides that are particularly
applied in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these weeds are preparing for winter,
they're bringing carbohydrates and
[SPEAKER_00]: resources down into the root system to
store that over the winter, help them get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you apply a herbicide at that
time, it takes the herbicide with it down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the root system and helps us destroy
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just some quick examples and
this type of extension, I found a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: support for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a lot of interest and
demand from farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of calls and questions after
presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what is this weed that I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get photos from a phone and then very
quickly followed, how do I kill it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this type of management or extension I
found to be very effective and I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to continue to build on this momentum
because this webinar series, these two
[SPEAKER_00]: great books that just came out,
we have some momentum going in this line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in looking to establish upcoming
new projects, new grant proposals,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to build on this, but at the same
time, I didn't want to bore farmers by
[SPEAKER_00]: going over all the species that they don't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know about the handful of
species that they're really having a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with, not necessarily all these
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make this more specific,
I was thinking back to some work that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had done in grad school doing germinable
weed seed bank assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we would take soil
samples, typically 10 samples from across
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, mix those up, bring them back
to a greenhouse, let the weeds emerge,
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to water, and encourage weeds to
emerge over the course of a summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: record all those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking, okay, this might be a good
way to bring this biological-based
[SPEAKER_00]: management information to a farm and
really look at and tailor it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: species that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular trial or project,
we found some interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw, okay, that weed species and the
weed community composition with these seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank analysis was, excuse me, was somewhat
explained by geochematic factors like
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude, longitude, growing degree days,
and then to a lesser extent by soil
[SPEAKER_00]: factors, geographic factors like pH,
soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of my regrets is that we didn't
include any management information about
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are they using tillage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of herbicides?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of crops are they planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that adding that kind of
information would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a group of us got together and we
were successful in doing just that and
[SPEAKER_00]: applying for a new project that uses these
weed seed bank analyses to do this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: trait-based extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be visiting 50 farms this fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're midway through that already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these farms are fruit, vegetables,
organic, conventional, field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of urban farms that are
participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's primarily an extension project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each farm, we'll provide photos of
their problem species and how to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: them with key features, show how their
weed seed bank compares to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a small weed seed bank or is
it rather large?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers like seeing how they
compare to other farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think most importantly is we're
gonna really look hard at the species that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have and work to come up with
tailored management recommendations and
[SPEAKER_00]: base that on the tools that are available
to each farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna come in and say,
you just need to add on one more piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, it costs $50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather come in and say, okay,
if you move this piece of Swiss cheese an
[SPEAKER_00]: inch to the left, you're gonna
dramatically improve your weed management
[SPEAKER_00]: really at no additional cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking for those types of win-win
situations based on adjusting farmers'
[SPEAKER_00]: timing of planting, maybe crop selection
and herbicides out of bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be 50 farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's likely that if you're a farmer
in New York state, there's gonna be one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those 50 is gonna be very similar to your
own situation with the weeds and what
[SPEAKER_00]: tools you have available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be translating these
recommendations into several languages,
[SPEAKER_00]: having them available in print and online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, yeah, we have booked the 50
farms that I would like to give a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you to county-based extension
educators as well as researchers that have
[SPEAKER_00]: strong connections with growers like Greg
Peck who helped get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that helped us is that
we had a $500 stipend for farmers to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do have some qualms with how
Cornell handles the stipend but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is primarily extension but we do have
some research questions that we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do particular species correlate with
crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: What determines where species are,
where they are and in which situations?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also be looking and screening for
some herbicide resistance for suspected
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some novel things related to
heat and enzymes to attempt to deplete
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also open to other questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be kind of an interesting data
set with 50 farms and all of the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: species encompassed with each of the
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're open to collaboration if anyone
has any additional questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit more on the heat and the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat, particularly above 100% 150
degrees Fahrenheit really just starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: cook weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few ways that this can be
established on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is through using clear
plastic, solarizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of a fun story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a high school student in the
Hudson Valley who was interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: solarization and went to his local county
extension service who put him in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: with Steve Reiners who put him in touch
with me because I had done some
[SPEAKER_00]: solarization before and we chatted a few
times over Zoom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just gave him one or two suggestions
about replication and some details but
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really his independent project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really, he got his own funding and
just did some amazing work over the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: and found treatment differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was looking at comparing plastic
versus biodegradable film for
[SPEAKER_00]: solarization.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found hotter temperatures achieved in
the plastic than the biodegradable mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: or film and likewise more mineralization
of N, P and K in the higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually took this work and was
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got first place at a local science fair
and is now in his first year at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping he was gonna be on hand to
sign autographs today but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very fun project to collaborate on
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ways that heat can be used to target
weed seeds that I was actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about from interested farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steam is used to some extent but it takes
a long time and it's not feasible on a
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're curious about boiling water and
they were thinking this could be applied
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker to larger areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I borrowed a camping stove and had
these very small plots set out
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of actually fairly large
volumes of boiling water applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately there wasn't a
significant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the boiling water didn't
penetrate deeply deep enough and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it cooled off fairly rapidly to not
actually kill the weed seeds that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course with perennial weeds it's
gonna be less effective anyways as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: likely emerging from rootstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was still very excited about this
other new idea to potentially degrade weed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and that weed seeds are typically
covered in a waxy coating that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: cutin and xylan and these materials help
protect the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain fungi and bacteria that
can break down that seed coat using
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can exude cutinase or xylanase to
help them break through and then break
[SPEAKER_00]: down the interior of the seed after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these enzymes actually you can
purchase online through the magic of
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinant DNA technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually did that and incubated
known quantities of lambsquarter seed for
[SPEAKER_00]: about eight hours to each of these
treatments and then buried the seed for
[SPEAKER_00]: six months in a living soil that was kept
moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking that okay if the enzyme gets the
job started and breaks down the seed coat
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps the ambient fungi and other
microbes in the soil could take advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: of those wounds and kind of finish the job
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately there was no significant
difference between any of the treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was unfortunate but I thought
maybe let me make sure I'm covering all my
[SPEAKER_00]: bases here and test the germinability,
the germ rate of the seed because if there
[SPEAKER_00]: was any type of damage you know perhaps it
would allow the seed to imbibe water more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and impact the germination and it
actually did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a significant difference in
the treatments based on whether they're
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to the enzymes or not and this is
a modest difference I'll admit but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still an encouraging result and that
you know maybe with improved methods if we
[SPEAKER_00]: do this again in the next few years we can
increase that result.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can get close to 100% of the seeds
to emerge then a farmer could just come
[SPEAKER_00]: through and control all those all the
weeds in their soil and basically have
[SPEAKER_00]: weed free conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to mention that we've done
some work in investigating this new breed
[SPEAKER_00]: of mechanical weeding tools that is coming
online to kind of reduce the burden on
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides and hand labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynn says now Steve and I both presented
at the Northeast Mechanical Weed Control
[SPEAKER_00]: Field Day this past summer and Lynn
actually recently purchased a NIO Oz
[SPEAKER_00]: weeding robot from France and gave us a
great opportunity to help set up these or
[SPEAKER_00]: help adjust these cultivation implements
on it and our two undergraduate summer
[SPEAKER_00]: research assistants Eric Bairdheim and
Juliana Lee got to help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was one of the highlights their
summer and they're now in their junior and
[SPEAKER_00]: senior years at Cornell and I think have
very bright futures ahead of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to wrap everything up with a nice
little bow I mentioned there's another
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of different strokes for different
folks that you might be more aware of than
[SPEAKER_00]: the boxing sense and that and this is the
the way that Sly and the Family Stone used
[SPEAKER_00]: in their song Everyday People is that
people are different and you know people
[SPEAKER_00]: do things in different ways and you know
we should celebrate that diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: really that applies to weed management and
that there's you know there's no single
[SPEAKER_00]: right way to manage weeds you know you can
do it a million different ways and and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: improving and you know not not letting my
own biases affect my extension but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know meeting farmers where they are and
you know one minute I may meet with a
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale you know conventional grower
just talking about different herbicides
[SPEAKER_00]: and the next minute I may be talking with
a small-scale organic farmer about hand
[SPEAKER_00]: tools so you know it's there is there's
there's so many ways to do it successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: and as long as you know I'm always trying
to to reduce risks and improve the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: control yes but also reduce risks related
to the environment human health and the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic bottom line for the farm and
actually this is a great example in itself
[SPEAKER_00]: of different strokes for different folks
and that some research from Maine showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no single best hand tool you
know they're all good at different things
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know the ergonomic of each of them
fits with different people in different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways based on how tall they are or other
factors and so we actually applied for
[SPEAKER_00]: some funding through the vegetable program
work team and we have about 20 different
[SPEAKER_00]: hoes that travel around the state with
kind of a whole library to different field
[SPEAKER_00]: events so farmers can test them out and
see which one works for them whoops and
[SPEAKER_00]: another sense of different strokes for
different folks is that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: different learning styles so a lot of us
in extension are really branching out from
[SPEAKER_00]: just presentations and one-on-one using
things like active learning and video
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts and something that I'm excited
about hopefully unveiling in the next year
[SPEAKER_00]: or two is something called a garden
notebook a campaign I hope to establish on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media that utilizes some of the
drawing and painting skills of a few of us
[SPEAKER_00]: in the IPM program to reach out to a new
audience probably backyard gardeners who
[SPEAKER_00]: might keep this type of notebook with pest
management information what are the key
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying characteristics of different
weeds for example and maybe we can work in
[SPEAKER_00]: some research-based management tips in
there as well so I've tried to include
[SPEAKER_00]: some acknowledgments as I've went I've
been really lucky to work with a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of people in different disciplines
as a lot of us are struggling with weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just want to thank the New York
State Department of Ag and Markets as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as DEC Northeast there and USDA for
funding related to some of the work I
[SPEAKER_00]: presented so thank you any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: right yeah I guess I should repeat that
for Sam yeah so the question is for Marvin
[SPEAKER_00]: about what is the status of robotic and
advanced weeding equipment yeah so a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is still in the development stage
but yeah there are are I used to say 10 I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to say 20 I don't know there's maybe
30 plus startups now that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: tackle this they're seeing this
opportunity of okay we're struggling with
[SPEAKER_00]: some herbicide resistance we're struggling
with labor shortages can advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: technology kind of take the place here and
a lot of it is you know being at the early
[SPEAKER_00]: stages and with economies of scale it's at
the very nascent stages so it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very expensive and typically it's mostly
applied in very high value crops
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in California where there's a
high density of high value crops so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can station a company there and maybe have
a handful of these tools share them
[SPEAKER_00]: between all the large farms in the area
but yeah we're they're starting to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: out from from California it's it's going
to be a while yet I think before the
[SPEAKER_00]: average farmer in New York has one of
these fancy robots but it does seem like
[SPEAKER_00]: prices are coming down and you know
they're becoming bit by bit more viable
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah yeah that's a great question and what
was your name Claire Claire so Claire was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking about you know how far in advance
can we predict certain weed problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: which species are going to be maybe
problematic or challenging in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: situations and yeah that's that's a great
question I think that to some extent you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some of these things are a little bit
of a no-brainer like the okay glyphosate
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant weeds and glyphosate if you're
only spraying glyphosate and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain sweets of weeds that are typically
problematic in like organic vegetables or
[SPEAKER_00]: you know depending on what type of crop it
is that you're growing or grapes like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned so to some extent we can get you
in the right ballpark just based on like
[SPEAKER_00]: okay this is the crop and this is the
frequency and timing of tillage and the
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicides used perhaps but there's this
other factor of what was the starting
[SPEAKER_00]: point of of the seed bank what's the
history of the field before it was grapes
[SPEAKER_00]: was it in you know was it pasture or what
you know what seed bank had built up there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would maybe still have a legacy
of that in that given site and and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're I mentioned most of our weed seeds
do you know just fall straight to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground but some like dandelions and like
horseweed do blow in so what is the farm's
[SPEAKER_00]: proximity to sources of those weeds are
near a big field of dandelions that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to constantly be coming in on so
yeah I think that there's there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain baseline level we can predict but
there's an overall level of you know kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of random effects that is going to be
unique to each situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian are there any examples of mobile
steam based weeding machines not weeding
[SPEAKER_03]: machines but a field treatment machine
yeah they do that in in Holland you know
[SPEAKER_03]: with with sandy soils and around here with
much more rocky and variable soils I could
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine that might be a problem but it
works quite successfully in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really okay yeah so Bill asked about
you know what are there examples of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know tractor drawn steam weeders and I'm
vaguely familiar with some that that can
[SPEAKER_00]: steam and have the soil covered as they go
there's there's like a covering that keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat in yeah it follows the steam and
I know there was some research a while ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that looked at steam in combination with
tillage because it can be difficult to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the steam throughout that soil column so
if you're if you're rototilling and also
[SPEAKER_00]: applying the steam it seems to it seems to
do a better job it was the take home I
[SPEAKER_00]: said so I remember so I miss I'm assuming
that there are examples of that as they I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if this was like a research
based a one-off that the researcher made
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah and I'd be curious to hear more
about in Holland are they I will try to
[SPEAKER_03]: dig up some photographs I certainly took
pictures of it so I have to go in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: fine yeah just for a comparison sake for
greenhouses is is the most common area
[SPEAKER_00]: where I see steam being used and they'll
they'll get the temperature up they'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: it by bed and so there's a hose that has
holes in it that allows the steam to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and that's covered each beds I think
they do four times to cover a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and those 30 minutes each
application yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: never really took off I think there's a
lot of complexity with trying to drive
[SPEAKER_03]: around and portrait with the machine that
big steam just that water they do have it
[SPEAKER_02]: for landscapes and then they've actually
adapted it also to foam so that the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: stays in place longer yeah a lot of like
fence like fence rows and so schools yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and that I think controlling the
existing weeds with heat it requires less
[SPEAKER_00]: energy than going to the soil and actually
killing the weed seeds but yeah yeah well
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a question about since you get
around quite a bit in the state and see a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of farmers see a lot of fields crops
I'm wondering you know one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: about climate change that you've always
talked about is the weeds are really gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: have a competitive even more of a
competitive advantage over a lot of our
[SPEAKER_03]: our crop plants and I'm wondering if
you're starting to see some of that come
[SPEAKER_03]: to you know come to be that sort of see
the species changing or difficulty
[SPEAKER_03]: controlling weeds maybe related to climate
change what are the growers saying because
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah what are you what are you hearing me
see yeah that's a great comment so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg asks and comments about climate
change you know bringing in potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: new species to this area or making our
existing species maybe more competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: with crops yeah and I think it's it's just
very hard to to generalize because and
[SPEAKER_00]: Kerry Marshner and Tony Tommaso have a
Smith Weaver project looking into this and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing some extension results right now
and and they've reviewed the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: and and it's it's very hit or miss and
species dependent you know based on you
[SPEAKER_00]: know c3 c4 grasses dicots and you know how
certain species are going to put out will
[SPEAKER_00]: fare in higher co2 versus higher
temperature or more drought there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: so much to it that it's just it's it's it
we can't make a generalization so for
[SPEAKER_00]: these educational materials we're kind of
providing key examples here and there of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you know what might happen but as far
as you know what we're actually seeing on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground Tony is is actively looking for
Johnson grass is one that he is is
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about as it's a very problematic
weed south of us and so you know if that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into New York it could be in trouble
we've already had introductions of of
[SPEAKER_00]: others that are herbicide resistant like
Palmer amaranth which is I believe native
[SPEAKER_00]: to the desert southwest US and perhaps due
to climate change it is now able to to
[SPEAKER_00]: complete its life cycle in northern
climates like New York and that is I think
[SPEAKER_00]: typically regarded as one of the world's
most competitive and problematic species
[SPEAKER_00]: so and that's unfortunately now in New
York in a few different counts so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah and I I have like I added this
small component so maybe five percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: my position it includes backyards and
natural areas and so I'm paying a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of attention but I think it's mostly
you know New York State DEC and and others
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA there's there's someone at the USDA
facility here who's looking at bio
[SPEAKER_00]: controls I think that if you remember
purple loose strife several years ago that
[SPEAKER_00]: just hovered places like Montezuma and now
you can go and you don't really see it as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as they they found a successful bio
control it's one of the most successful
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of bio control and I think that
that's where it really has to come from
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's been you know there's been
efforts of eradication based on spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: and people going out with fruits but it's
just so widespread at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like Japanese knotweed and the
garlic mustard that you know physically I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think we have the human power to to
go out and make a significant dent unless
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a massive funding but so I think
that the way forward is really through bio
[SPEAKER_00]: control and with these land landscape
level issues like that and and and that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an active area of research
elsewhere that I just haven't taken part
[SPEAKER_01]: in yet all right all right thank you this
[SPEAKER_01]: has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu you you
