[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for coming back.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another panel discussion upon us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is kind of broad and entitled,
Interested in a Hemp Business?
[SPEAKER_07]: This panel is going to look at some
factors to consider before entering the
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp field and the building blocks of a
successful research project and building a
[SPEAKER_07]: future business around hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of broad, but a little more
focused perhaps on the next steps.
[SPEAKER_07]: As a reminder, again, in this session
we'll hear from each one of our panelists
[SPEAKER_07]: for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you are thinking of a question
now or during their comments, write that
[SPEAKER_07]: down on that card, hold it up,
and we will retrieve them and answer those
[SPEAKER_07]: questions when we get to the end of our
session.
[SPEAKER_07]: So without any further ado, our first
panelist, Susie Cody, from the Hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: Industries Association, please welcome
Susie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for this opportunity and for
inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I represent the advocates that are around
New York State and we've been working
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard for the last several years to
get the word out about hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's my observation that right now
what's happening, three pretty interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: things in our culture and our society
right now, our advancement in technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: our current social awareness and the
access that we have to communication with
[SPEAKER_02]: each other, and also the current
challenges that we are all as humans
[SPEAKER_02]: facing and having in common, climate
problems, environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that what we're doing or what
we're seeing is hemp is coming in and it
[SPEAKER_02]: could be a solution to these problems and
use these to its advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing things like the possibility of
replacing petroleum with hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing our contaminated soils and
industrial waste, these are large scale
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and knowing that we can grow hemp
in a large scale industrial way is a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage to us right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really exciting to be finding
out today is how much the state and the
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians are behind hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see nothing but moving forward
at this point, which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we've been working for for so
many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, what are the marketing
opportunities that come out of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, like it's been mentioned here
before, 25,000 plus uses of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think New York could take advantage
of is growing hemp for like the fiber and
[SPEAKER_02]: the herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of different, like Canada and other
countries are really getting into the oil
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing it for grain, which is
definitely a market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could corner the market on fiber and as
we're learning and researching how to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality fiber, we could be using it
instead of seeing it as a waste product
[SPEAKER_02]: where some places they have to,
either get rid of it or they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: properly processing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be used for like animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how many of you are
aware, but it can be used for building
[SPEAKER_02]: houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's processed in the right way and
combined with lime and water, we can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually build houses out of it and other
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got many qualities to it that are
desirable in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially it's got a high R value and
it's mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rodent resistant, fire resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's definitely one thing to
start looking into as far as marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biofuels, people could start creating
co-ops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it happen in Vermont and
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers getting together and pooling their
resources and creating their own biofuels
[SPEAKER_02]: for their tractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a lot of niche markets that
could be created.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could start growing and having the
production happen on a smaller scale while
[SPEAKER_02]: we're waiting for the industry to create a
large scale production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one place in Kentucky, I know they're
growing hemp and they're partnering with
[SPEAKER_02]: some animal growers and they're combining
the fiber and making American flags out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are really some unique and
creative ideas that people could start to
[SPEAKER_02]: cash in on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things though is that we have
to really consider and hopefully that will
[SPEAKER_02]: be researched here in New York is the
demand for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to ensure that if we're
gonna put all this energy behind growing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and creating it, who's gonna buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's gonna use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's gonna put the money up to retrofit
their factories to stop creating paper
[SPEAKER_02]: from wood and start to use hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are gonna need a switch
over in equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done a lot of research about
that but I know that there are certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are gonna have to be changed
in order to enable hemp to come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: really enable that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that's really important is
to educate our farmers and enable them to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a fair shot to let this be something
that they can bring into their rotation
[SPEAKER_02]: and work with them, share this
information, allow them to use their
[SPEAKER_02]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know their land, they know how to
grow crops and everybody works together
[SPEAKER_02]: with this information and we just are able
to create stronger varieties, more
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable varieties and really open up
industry to come into this state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And grow from within as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of companies already that
are looking to use hemp for their products
[SPEAKER_02]: and it would be excellent if we could be
supplying them for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I just wanna encourage
education really is what we need to do and
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be great if there was some
funding that went along for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's really essentially gonna
grow our markets and the demand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Suzy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give her a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_07]: And next panelist to discuss textiles and
packaging, right here from Cornell's
[SPEAKER_07]: College of Human Ecology, Dr. Anil
Netrovalli.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a faculty member for the last 30
years, I like to stand and deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a PowerPoint and I didn't want
to also put my laser beam onto these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna be standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm in the Department of Fiber
Science and Apparel Design and we look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all the varieties of fibers, natural or
synthetic and their applications in a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, and we work with both natural
fibers and synthetic fibers as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, but my recent work has been
more in the natural fibers than the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic fibers, although I have done
work in this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some of the fibers that we
have used in the past and of course hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of them, but we had to import hemp
and now I'm so happy to see that hemp will
[SPEAKER_00]: be grown in my own state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are lots of other fibers as
well, but hemp has certain advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is among the oldest industries on
earth, going back to 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Chinese museum, they have a wrapping
paper-like material that's more than 2,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: President Washington and Thomas Jefferson
grew hemp, so we have some company there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp fiber is longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it comes from the stem or the
bast of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stronger than cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more absorbent than cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more insulative than cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of advantages compared
to cotton in using a hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp grows well without herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did hear about the herbicides,
fungicides and pesticides, but it can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without all these compared to any of the
cotton varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically much more eco-friendly than
cottonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the cross-section of the hemp
plant and the bast, that is the skin of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant from which you can derive the
fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they are first derived, you can have
them coarser, much coarser, but you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is called, cottonizing it,
make it into much more much finer fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a look at the coarser hemp
fibers, they could be used very easily for
[SPEAKER_00]: bags for packaging, carpets for primary
backing or the secondary backing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ropes because hemp is much stronger
than cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also longer, so it's easier to spin
it into a rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a great example of use of
rope, hemp ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: USS Constitution, more than 200 years ago,
all the ropes here were hemp ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course, once it is made into finer
variety or cottonized, we can have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of fabrics or yarns or apparel,
all varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actually outside, there are lots
of nice clothing available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, downtown we had a hemp store a
few years ago, I don't know what happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just mention about what I have been
doing in the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research is fiber-reinforced
composites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in composite materials, for example,
if you play tennis, the racket is made out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a composite material, epoxy and
graphite fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fly in the Boeing Dreamliner,
60% of the structure is made out of
[SPEAKER_00]: composite materials, graphite and epoxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for many applications, we really don't
need graphite or epoxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1930s, this is Henry Ford,
who made the first composite using natural
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers, hemp fibers, and soy protein-based
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was testing it with his hammer here
in this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, petroleum became cheaper and
then things changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our lab, we do use natural fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we use soy protein,
modify it chemically and make it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, and add to that fibers which are
very strong, hemp or other fibers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have used a variety of them,
and then make it into a composite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use the fibers in fiber form or
woven form or knitted form, depending upon
[SPEAKER_00]: what is needed in the composite materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can make the composites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have actually a few samples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps I can pass those.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are made out of jute fibers and 50%
jute fibers and 50% soy protein-based
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no VOCs, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are really hungry, you can eat
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one condition, you got to have
good teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pass these along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pass these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell has been very nice to me,
and what they did was when we built the
[SPEAKER_00]: Savage Hall, the fourth floor on the
Savage Hall, all the cabinetrys and
[SPEAKER_00]: shelvings and everything were made out of
these materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been like four or five years,
and perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Suzie made mention about the
housing and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a company which makes hemp crete,
and that's a house built in North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible fabric house made out of hemp
fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insulation on everything that you need for
housing can be made using hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to take much of your
time, so I'll wait for your questions if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have any later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now to our partners from this morning,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: Attracting investors, Dan Dalgen and Mark
Just from JD Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's truly, I would tell you,
it's amazing to see when government and
[SPEAKER_05]: academia and the private sector can work
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think great things are happening,
and will continue to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you on behalf of our farm for all
the work that's been done in Albany and in
[SPEAKER_05]: Binghamton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why did we get into this, and is there
a market out there that can be addressed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one of the things that struck
Dan and I about hemp was that you can walk
[SPEAKER_05]: to a Wegmans, you can walk to a Whole
Foods, you can go to any place in
[SPEAKER_05]: Brookman, and you can buy seeds,
you can have it on your yogurt,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can have it in cereal, you can have it
in your granola, but you couldn't grow it
[SPEAKER_05]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that to us, we found that incredibly
interesting, and we started doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: research on why that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we think there is a great market in
hemp, and it's slowly evolving.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the things that we like
about hemp, and we think it's interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: for investors to take a look at hemp over
time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one is, it's been stated,
it's an over $600 million market in the U
[SPEAKER_05]: .S.
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very little hemp is grown in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Eric Steentra is here, you can vote hemp,
and you can really look at some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: statistics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I particularly liked it because it's
actually grown in a climate that's colder
[SPEAKER_05]: than New York and has less sunlight,
so that was encouraging to me to think of
[SPEAKER_05]: it's grown 100 plus thousand acres up
there, wildly successfully, that we should
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to do it here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to give you another statistic,
about 1% of the households in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: actually have hemp in their kitchen
cabinets, and if you stop and you think
[SPEAKER_05]: about that as a superfood, as a vegan
source of protein, great omega 3s and 6s,
[SPEAKER_05]: in an area that people are looking at
superfoods, like flax, like chia,
[SPEAKER_05]: again, what I talked about up there in a
slightly different setting was simply that
[SPEAKER_05]: it should return to its rightful place as
a crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a panacea, it's not gonna change
the world overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's massive amounts of infrastructure
investment that have to be made if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going into bio composites or materials,
you know, fiber, those are things that
[SPEAKER_05]: have left the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and are gonna require tens of millions of
dollars and more to bring back
[SPEAKER_05]: successfully if you're gonna have any type
of scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: The simple path to production with hemp
really is an agricultural setting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that we used a grain drill
out of the 1970s we used a combine from a
[SPEAKER_05]: neighboring farm with a corn head on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We plowed it with our plows from the
1970s.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all off the shelf technology
that's absolutely accessible to anyone in
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that, pig pack manure,
which we have, dairy liquid, dairy manure,
[SPEAKER_05]: and pelletized chicken manure,
again, all of these things are readily
[SPEAKER_05]: available, and on a return on investment
basis, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It absolutely makes sense to look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stalks, when we finished harvesting
with the grain head on the combine,
[SPEAKER_05]: thanks to Gianforte Farms incredible
partner, we used our existing square
[SPEAKER_05]: bailing technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cut it with our rotary mower,
we bailed them up, and then we moved them
[SPEAKER_05]: to Katie Malia's Ecovative Design for
their bio composite materials business.
[SPEAKER_05]: That replaced hemp that was coming in from
Holland in France.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it didn't cost us any more to bail
the hemp than it did to bail our own
[SPEAKER_05]: organic hay that we have going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we're an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm agnostic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it because it allows us to be more
competitive versus the Midwest,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is obviously, you know, large
conventional.
[SPEAKER_05]: In New York, we think organic's a slightly
better way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: People with large conventional farms in
the Finger Lakes certainly could avail
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves of conventional produced hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to talk about disease over time
because it is a concern of ours,
[SPEAKER_05]: right, as we grow this business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that I think that makes a
lot of sense is why would you go into
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a market that's readily
available right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look on the web.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a look at the web.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the hemp seeds on the web.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the hemp and vegan protein powers
on the web.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the hemp oil that's on the web
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that comes in from Canada or China.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more interest in food transparency
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our consumers sitting next to this 11
million person marketplace in New York,
[SPEAKER_05]: it makes enormous sense for us to be very
competitive in that marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other thing that I would tell you
as well to attract investors, find great
[SPEAKER_05]: partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Gianforte Farms, it had the
combine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were working with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have enormous talent in the grain
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found millers that are right off the
shelf in the Hudson Valley that are
[SPEAKER_05]: milling our hemp flour for us right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We found presses in the Hudson Valley that
are pressing our oil to separate the oil
[SPEAKER_05]: from the seed cake to go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Brooklyn, in the food tech area,
there's no one better in the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: than New York in terms of food tech and
innovative food.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we'd like to see obviously that
in the southern tier as well, in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Binghamton area, more food processing
there as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of this stuff is ready-made and
set up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you go out and you talk to
investors, right, which we've done,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the market big enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your ROI when you start investing
in the business?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's scalable, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can start with 30 acres, go to 100,
go to 200, go to thousands of acres over
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where it gets more difficult is if you
have a more restricted legislative
[SPEAKER_05]: environment where people are asking
questions like, well, do you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: license?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the license processing work?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't say enough about what happened
in Albany because they basically are
[SPEAKER_05]: opening up the licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: For next year, if you lift the cap,
it's going to basically open up to all
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers in the states that have a rational
plan to attack this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be a huge difference for
detracting investment dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Initially we went in, we started,
we actually planted the crop and didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: know if we could actually even harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've come a long way in the last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, again, a good ROI business,
a business that there's a wide and large
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace to be able to attack,
an easy path.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick the easiest path to production,
which is actually putting seeds in the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground, working with smart local partners
to get stuff done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet 2.0 is the processing facilities,
the hubs in which you're actually going to
[SPEAKER_05]: drive more of this cooperative model.
[SPEAKER_05]: As Suzy articulated, that we think is a
tremendous opportunity for farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's growing to the north of
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're growing it successfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think we should have our rightful place
in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's a pretty easy model to
attract dollars if you have a rational
[SPEAKER_05]: plan of attack to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan's going to talk a little bit about the
downside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'm going to be the skunk in the
hemp garden, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to caution that just because
you put it in the ground doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_04]: people are going to come knocking at your
door and pay you X amount of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the hemp market still
needs to be explored.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some great research being done
in textiles and biomaterials.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't necessarily mean that the
market is there yet for an entrepreneur to
[SPEAKER_04]: assume that they're going to go and raise
money off of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really have to have a plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And treat this as an entrepreneurial
venture where you understand the market
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going into, how it all works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I'll contradict myself,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as you can have a plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of Mike Tyson's favorite quotes is,
everyone has a plan until they get punched
[SPEAKER_04]: in the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a seasonality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is crop loss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is also the regulations and the
federal framework.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of confusion right now
in terms of what's going to happen with
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp and how it's treated and how it's
treated in comparison to marijuana and
[SPEAKER_04]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of murkiness out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that it's a great crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's got a lot of versatility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are 25,000 different uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't mean that there's 25,000
different markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to encourage people who are
applying for a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you all do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you all really, really research
and investigate what's the best path for
[SPEAKER_04]: you to explore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be that on the food side, on the textile
side, on the biomaterial side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to address any of those
industries in questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's not going to serve New
York.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not going to serve the industry
well if we have crops, thousands of acres
[SPEAKER_04]: put in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nowhere to really offload or sell
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important that we treat this as a
rising tide in many ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's good for the goose is good for the
gander.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we all help develop the market and
help establish the pathway to success
[SPEAKER_04]: together, I think that'll create an
industry where other farmers will take
[SPEAKER_04]: notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the question this morning or
this afternoon about, is this an expansion
[SPEAKER_04]: or a shift?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think it's both.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's going to be the early
adopters that really have to find those
[SPEAKER_04]: markets and establish and grow them for
farmers to really figure out, are they
[SPEAKER_04]: going to replace corn or wheat or soy with
hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are they going to buy additional land?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are they going to convert the
conventional dairies over to hemp crops?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that does happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see that happening down the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that the folks
who get into this get into this for the
[SPEAKER_04]: right reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not just throwing those seeds
in the ground thinking that it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be a cure for everything that ails them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a panacea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is an excellent crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can make a tremendous valuable addition
to existing agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you both.
[SPEAKER_07]: A round of applause.
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate both your experience and
your optimism and your risk tolerance for
[SPEAKER_07]: getting this started.
[SPEAKER_07]: But after all, it does really start with
the customer who's going to buy this stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: that we like to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next panelist, Dr. Christine Smart
from Cornell, will talk to us a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: about hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the interim director of the School of
Integrative Plant Science here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who weren't here this
morning, that's a school of about 900
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a breadth of scientific activities
going on from basic understanding of how
[SPEAKER_01]: plants work to many folks that look to
solve problems that are affecting New York
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture today.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we heard about the opportunity for
hemp to be grown statewide, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks to the work of our colleagues in
Albany, we were excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a group of people together here to
try to figure out what barriers might we
[SPEAKER_01]: see or identify in possible production and
having more growers grow hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how might we work with growers,
with industry people, with legislators,
[SPEAKER_01]: with really everyone in this room to break
down some of those barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first things that we tend to do
in the plant sciences when, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we have a problem or we have a new
plant, one of the things that we always do
[SPEAKER_01]: is say, all right, let's get as many
different types of this plant as we can
[SPEAKER_01]: and do variety trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, probably between the plant
scientists that are in this room,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have done 100,000 variety trials,
right, of all kinds of plants across the
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first thing that we're
doing with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Don, as he mentioned earlier,
he started that last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Don's leadership, we're going to
expand that in 2017 to three different
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to date we have 17 different
varieties that we're going to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Don said, some are fiber,
some are oil, and some are dual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at least to my knowledge,
we really don't know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in each of those categories what
commercially available varieties are
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to work best for folks in New
York and not folks anywhere in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guess is that different varieties are
going to be more well suited to different
[SPEAKER_01]: locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, someone on the top of a hill in
the southern tier is going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a very different variety than
someone that's growing on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to start to figure out what
varieties are going to grow best.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some areas that are much
more well suited to fiber production
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to oil production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the kinds of things we
really need to know so that we can enable
[SPEAKER_01]: growers to get the best yield that they
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we going to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, the varieties that are
commercially available right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: A, as we've heard, I think, 35 times
today, they're kind of hard to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, you know, none of them
were grown specifically for New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a challenge for us that we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume that varieties from Canada,
we have some evidence that varieties from
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada will do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's varieties from
Colorado or Kentucky or Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how are those going to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to be able to compare that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do we want to be able to look at
those, but we want the growers of New York
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to look at those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for this first year, as Don
mentioned, we're going to have tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we specifically will have some field
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to enable you guys to look at the
commercially available varieties and
[SPEAKER_01]: decide what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who am I to tell you what to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're way better at growing things than I
am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to do is enable you to
make that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the height.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we'll be able to learn as
much, or in my case, I would love to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: way more from you than what you can learn
from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that working together,
we'll be able to then start to knock down
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I'm really personally
interested in is looking at the disease
[SPEAKER_01]: and insect pest issues that we might face
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an administrator three days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, really seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm definitely a plant producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pathologist two days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my background is in diseases of
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hopefully, Commissioner Ball,
help the vegetable growers in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: New York grow healthy fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we really don't know is
what kind of disease and insect pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: are we going to have on hemp here in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, there was 30 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty small target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wouldn't really expect, thankfully,
to have huge disease or insect pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we have more hemp grown for a larger
number of years, we're definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: expect to see more disease and insect
issues pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an opportunity for us to really be
ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can, we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will, thanks to funding from the state
of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be surveying, I hope to survey,
every hemp field in New York this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that won't be a huge number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to get a feel for what our
growers are seeing, what we see at our
[SPEAKER_01]: research trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be really interesting to see
what we see in those different variety
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, are there some varieties
that those Japanese beetles don't land on?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these guys saw a lot of Japanese
beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that they caused any damage,
but they might in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the kinds of things these
variety trials are really going to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I wanted to talk about in
terms of where we see Cornell going with
[SPEAKER_01]: this is, you know, in 2018 we will have,
I hope, that we will be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: trials across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, additional trials on research
farms, including in the North Country,
[SPEAKER_01]: at places like Willisboro, perhaps in Lake
Placid, additional places here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: southern tier, to get a better feel,
again, for what varieties are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: One issue that we know that we could have,
will have a problem with is stand
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are those seeds going to
germinate and really establish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, Alan Taylor is going to
look at, are there ways, are there things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can do to increase that stand
establishment so your plants really have a
[SPEAKER_01]: great start to life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you know, you could be in real
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we hope to have trials in
conjunction with some of the growers here
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we do very frequently is
have either a demonstration trial on a
[SPEAKER_01]: grower's field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say, hey, we think this variety might
be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love for you to try it on your field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have a day where people can
come in and look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sometimes growers will come to me and
say, hey, I think I have this really great
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to do this experiment on my farm
and look at the differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in 2018, those are the kinds of
things that we'll really see happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great partnership that many of you know
we have is with Cornell Cooperative
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with funds, again, that the state has
discussed today, we will have three
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooperative Extension point of contacts
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one will be here in the southern
tier, Janice Degney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll have two in the north
country, Mike Hunter and Kitty O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these folks will be eyes and ears in
the fields in locations where those of us
[SPEAKER_01]: that are on the Ithico or Geneva campuses
are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: One really cool thing, is that we will
also have a harvest New York specialist
[SPEAKER_01]: working on the economics of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: As many folks have talked about,
we really need to get a better handle on
[SPEAKER_01]: the inputs versus the outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that will be a huge help to
our hemp team.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I think many of us
have realized today is that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a hemp team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fairly large group, but it's really
actually kind of small at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really certain that working
together, we can help establish a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation for an industrial hemp industry
here in New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have a couple of questions from the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_07]: This first one is for Dr. Nuttavalli and
Susie Cody both.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll read it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, hemp was my grandmother's
favorite dish towel fabric.
[SPEAKER_07]: She would search for it at estate sales
when it was no longer available in fabric
[SPEAKER_07]: stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chefs in New York have driven much of our
grown in New York education.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they be a good pilot market to begin
popularizing hemp fabric?
[SPEAKER_07]: They would likely be likely to appreciate
its absorbency and long lasting aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I strongly encourage anybody to
experiment with making any products with
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or anything like that to start getting
people familiarized with the products
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it starts at a small scale,
I mean, that's how this movement has grown
[SPEAKER_02]: from a small scale and now look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we definitely need to educate our
population as to what the products are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, what they're capable of,
and be using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just would like to echo her
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to hear that at least somebody
remembers grandmother using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fibers are really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb more moisture or water than
cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be made very soft, cotton-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could be also woven in different
designs to feel soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there's a large opportunity
for doing trials and bringing the products
[SPEAKER_00]: to market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard earlier today somewhere
around north of 25,000 potential uses for
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully at our 10th summit, we'll talk
about getting to 50,000 uses of the
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: But certainly that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question, is there a role for a
formal cooperative structure to help
[SPEAKER_07]: develop markets?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the comparison was drawn to
what we currently do for our dairy
[SPEAKER_07]: industry to help grow the dairy business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would say that the answer is
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that having that set up in New
York would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's something that under
the leadership of Albany could be very
[SPEAKER_05]: effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you look at Canada right now
and you think of the size of the crops
[SPEAKER_05]: that are going on there and the hundreds
of thousands of acres, for us to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to build the types of continuous
processing plants for fiber production,
[SPEAKER_05]: or for biomaterials, or for that matter,
for de-hauling, those types of capex
[SPEAKER_05]: require huge amounts of throughput of
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think setting up a formal
cooperative or buying structure makes an
[SPEAKER_05]: enormous amount of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then those farmers that would
prefer to do a contract-based sale could
[SPEAKER_05]: do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those people that wanted to more forward
integrate and own some of that processing
[SPEAKER_05]: could also, there's an opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that makes us much more
competitive, much faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would absolutely be in favor of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, would you disagree with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we touched on a little this
morning, is that New York would really
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit from a processing hub.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think saying what I said before
about don't assume when you put it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground that someone's going to come
knocking on your door to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we had a processing hub and a co-op
that really was robust enough,
[SPEAKER_04]: you would be able to allow farmers to kind
of treat it like a commodity crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not something we necessarily want to
see subsidized, but it's something that I
[SPEAKER_04]: think we want to see there to be enough
throughput and demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think having a co-op would really be
the first step in creating that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And lastly, I'd just add that the only
national brands, if you look on any store
[SPEAKER_05]: shelves right now, it's Manitoba Harvest
and Nativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's grown out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go to Whole Foods or you go to
anyplace else and pick up, that's grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's grown out of a cooperative
model where basically they're aggregating
[SPEAKER_05]: in large processing facilities in
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then moving the stuff in mass across
the border.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not advocating a tariff, I think we
can compete.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I think we can certainly be
competitive with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a quick question for Dan and Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you in a position to describe the REDC
grant that you got and where that's
[SPEAKER_03]: heading?
[SPEAKER_03]: People may find that interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they did receive some economic
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we can talk about we are
actually not going to take that grant
[SPEAKER_05]: presently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because where we looked at it
and we looked, and again, this came down
[SPEAKER_05]: to, it's kind of a good lesson because
some of the things you learn is that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we spent a lot of time going to
the different hemp conferences around the
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you look at the current process and
it's going on with hemp in places like
[SPEAKER_05]: Kentucky and you look at, and Dr. Nativa
and I were speaking just a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: beforehand, it's like, you know,
there's KNAF and other continuous process.
[SPEAKER_05]: That specific grant, having the type of
throughput that you would need to build a
[SPEAKER_05]: large processing facility, we still
thought for us we were several years out
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where a cooperative model where
there was some risk sharing in these types
[SPEAKER_05]: of processing facilities would make a lot
more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, here's the good thing is we
applied for the grant over the summer and
[SPEAKER_04]: goes back to having a plan, being able to
be flexible enough to pivot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We initially thought, as Mark was saying,
that we would kind of build this
[SPEAKER_04]: processing plant ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really we were the only game in town.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were just putting our 30 acres
through that, which is not nearly enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've done research and really you
need 50,000 basically acres of hemp to
[SPEAKER_04]: really justify the capex of a major
processing plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why there aren't very many
around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kentucky is in the process of building
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I really encourage the state
to invest in that or invest in people like
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Privatera, who is, Mark, you could
raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's the guy who I think is positioned
to create that type of plant and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: could use as much of the state support as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as the industry grows,
we hopefully will have enough throughput
[SPEAKER_04]: to justify that capex.
[SPEAKER_04]: We turned down the grant, but I think the
good news is that if you apply and you
[SPEAKER_04]: discuss hemp and you make the case for it,
that you can actually receive that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It certainly has been a good model in many
areas of agriculture around the country
[SPEAKER_07]: that there is protection and it offers an
opportunity to mitigate risk, but also to
[SPEAKER_07]: work collectively protected in a
marketplace that needs to be understood a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit better yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great question and great answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question is, how can the industry
overcome misconceptions about hemp and
[SPEAKER_07]: become more widely adopted by farms of all
sizes and across the state?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, I think the biggest
challenge facing the industry and I've
[SPEAKER_04]: spent a lot of time in DC, both in my
prior life working for government,
[SPEAKER_04]: but recently with Eric Stinchra's help and
the great work he's doing with Vote Hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: talking to congressmen and senators and
there are some who get it and they
[SPEAKER_04]: instantly understand that hemp is
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And marijuana is horticulture and there's
a big difference between the two,
[SPEAKER_04]: both on the regulatory side, but also on
the sort of genetic side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just encourage people to educate their
congressmen, their elected officials,
[SPEAKER_04]: make their voice heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, I was saying again this
morning that hemp is actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: should be law enforcement's favorite tool
because it's, the cross pollination helps
[SPEAKER_04]: eradicate illicit marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not for or against that per se,
but it is something that comes up a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: that, well, hemp is a sort of gateway crop
to growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like throwing raw meat into the
lion's den.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the last place you'd want to
put marijuana is into a field of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, you know, we grew 30 acres and,
you know, I'm sure we upset a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_04]: who had little backyard grows in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on their land and it's just one of
those things that people aren't aware
[SPEAKER_04]: enough of the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's 3% of households
understand that difference and there's so
[SPEAKER_04]: much education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I support to, you know, looking at Vote
Hemp and kind of signing up when there's
[SPEAKER_04]: actions to take to inform your congressmen
and signing petitions and whatnot because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's really the only way we'll overcome
the education gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe, you know, addressing the small
farms issue because obviously that is if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to go out and do this,
you don't want to have to spend six months
[SPEAKER_05]: as we talked about getting a DEA permit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the biggest thing to make
this more accessible to farms of all sizes
[SPEAKER_05]: because the technology exists to put this
in the ground and harvest it is really the
[SPEAKER_05]: seed issue and the permitting to make it
available and having that run out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: That probably is the single biggest gating
factor for everyone here today because if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're opening up the caps on permits,
that's the last straw.
[SPEAKER_05]: And working with universities like Cornell
in terms of establishing seed programs in
[SPEAKER_05]: the states, in New York, that will really
open up the floodgates for the industry I
[SPEAKER_05]: think.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was probably the most important
thing that I got out of today was getting
[SPEAKER_05]: that permitting process from the state
level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have time for just one more
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this one is basically kind of a
federal issue, but do we see the current
[SPEAKER_07]: philosophy coming out of Washington having
any impact on the hemp industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Eric, do you want to field it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I could take it from here, but I think
you'd probably be best positioned to
[SPEAKER_04]: address that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's really the change in
administration and the current philosophy
[SPEAKER_04]: and approach to cannabis and how that's
impacting the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would wholeheartedly concur.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the same answer as the previous
question is really largely in education.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think when you get a chance to have
that conversation, it will prevail because
[SPEAKER_07]: it obviously makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think programs like what we're doing
here in New York help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think especially, you know,
I'm a pretty New York-centric guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm born and bred here, and I tend to
think if we can do it here, we can do it
[SPEAKER_04]: everywhere as the adage goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really applaud the department and
you, Donna, for the foresight and the
[SPEAKER_04]: vision and creating what I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this morning is I think we have the
most permissive and progressive program in
[SPEAKER_04]: the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a matter of years, we will be the
epicenter for all things hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get a round of applause for all the
panelists here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
