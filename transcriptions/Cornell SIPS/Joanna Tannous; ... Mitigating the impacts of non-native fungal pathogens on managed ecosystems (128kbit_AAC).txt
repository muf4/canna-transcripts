[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Katie, for the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank the chairs for
the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I couldn't do the seminar
in person, but I'm excited to be sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: with you today our ongoing research on the
secure ecosystem engineering and design to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate the impacts of non-native fungal
pathogens on managed ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Katie already presented,
I'm an early-career staff scientist at Oak
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge National Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know,
I put the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab is located in East Tennessee,
and I put as reference Atlanta,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is two and a half hours drive from
Oak Ridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a picture of our CNI campus
where cutting-edge research meets natural
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just give two fun facts about
ORNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lab has played an important role in
the discovery of Tennessean, adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: unique element to the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's the proud home of Frontier,
which is the world's fast supercomputer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at ORNL, we focus on delivering
scientific discoveries to ensure the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States' security and prosperity by
addressing different challenges ranging
[SPEAKER_00]: from energy, environmental, and security
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another fun fact, many are surprised to
learn that at ORNL, we actually conduct
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal research because when they think of
national labs, ORNL, or other national
[SPEAKER_00]: labs, they think they just do nuclear
science, nuclear engineering, or material
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that we actually have a
bioscience division is surprising for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, my colleague, Dr. Tom Osteros,
who I actually met at UWA, William
[SPEAKER_00]: Madison, he was also in the plant
pathology department with Katie,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I, we both co-run the fungal lab and
the fungal program at ORNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Osteros' research mainly focusing on
fungal interactions and biotechnology,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas my research as a fungal geneticist
and biologist focused on developing
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced genetic engineering tools to
unlock the potential of fungi for
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are pictures from our busy lab
this past summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The research I will be discussing in my
seminar today is part of the Secure
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecosystem Engineering and Design,
short for SEED, science-focused area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this SFA, we drive innovative
science and technology to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and manipulate how
microorganisms, can either be bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, which is our focus, are able to
establish a spread and how they are
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting ecosystems that are critical or
of high importance for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the outline of my talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I will start by giving a brief
overview about the pathos system that we
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on within our SEED SFA, trying to
further understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will highlight the critical knowledge of
gaps, mainly when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the molecular mechanisms
responsible for the pathogenicity of our
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen and how we are, in my second
part, I will talk about how we are driving
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative genetic research to be able to
elucidate the mechanisms driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence, but as well as developing
genetic strategies to better control the
[SPEAKER_00]: spread of fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, why popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: So poplars are vital crocs for the
Department of Energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because first they are like fasted
growing tree species, but also because
[SPEAKER_00]: they serve as a foundational feedstock for
producing biofuel, bioenergy and other
[SPEAKER_00]: bio-based chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: At ORNL, we focus primarily at poplar,
just because it has a fully sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was one of the first three
genomes to be published and it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: this work has been done by a scientist at
ORNL and it made it to the cover of
[SPEAKER_00]: Science on September 15, 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also valued working with poplar due
to its genetic tractability, so it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation system and strong
hybridization potential, which made it a
[SPEAKER_00]: prime model to be able to advance research
efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this crop is limited to be used
in industrial application, mainly due to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungal diseases that are caused
primarily by the pathogen spherulina
[SPEAKER_00]: missiva, or known for the longest time as
septoria missiva, which is an ascomycid
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pathogen was first described in
1884 on poplars deltoides in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: states, but it has later been spread
unintentionally by human activities as it
[SPEAKER_00]: will, and it was recently introduced and
established into the Pacific Northwest of
[SPEAKER_00]: North America, and now it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this figure on the right show,
I showed the propagation of this pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that spread across North America,
and we saw that there was like distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the Southeastern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: population, we have the U.S.-Canadian
subpopulation, and we also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically distinct British Columbia
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm bringing this population right now
because they will come up later in my
[SPEAKER_00]: talk, which we're going to talk about them
more in depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just note that we actually have 122
isolates of each of these population that
[SPEAKER_00]: were collected, and we have the genome
sequence for them, and that has really
[SPEAKER_00]: been very helpful to advance our research
efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this pathogen is responsible for the
septoria leaf spots and stem canker
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases on susceptible poplice genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the leaf spots are mainly just
reducing the static values of poplar,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cankers are the ones that have the
greatest industrial impacts due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that a single infection can kill a
whole tree and snap it in half,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would reduce the yields and the
use of poplar for industrial applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm actually also showing additional
pictures that were taken by Tomas in our
[SPEAKER_00]: local Blount County poplice field where
most of our field experiments take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, I'm showing how a diseased
poplar look like, and healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I put it in quotes, healthy,
because although it's a resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, it can still be infected by
spherulina, and we've seen that several
[SPEAKER_00]: times where the pathogen is actually
endophytically living inside the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does not cause diseases because the
genotype is actually resistant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms and the disease development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's also other pictures showing canker
disease propagation, and how the cankers
[SPEAKER_00]: look like when it's a late stage canker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to note that those cankers,
although we were able to isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: spherulina from it, we cannot necessarily
say that they're adjusted due to
[SPEAKER_00]: spherulina because we were able to isolate
other pathogens that cause cankers as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just wanted to show you how a canker
disease propagation look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe a lot of you are already
familiar with fungal pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we know, their pathogenicity have a
spectrum ranging from biotrophy to
[SPEAKER_00]: necrotrophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biotrophs are closely associated with
living host cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They extract the nutrients and grow and
reproduce without killing the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that they are not
able to cause damage, which the great
[SPEAKER_00]: example is rust fungi that cause
significant damage on crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also the necrotroph that would
rely on that host tissue to extract
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and they release enzymes and
toxins that will actually break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell wall and would kill the host cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greatest example is betritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a third class, which is where
our spherulina pathogen falls in,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the hemibiotroph pathogens,
where they begin their life cycle as
[SPEAKER_00]: biotroph.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then later they would transition into
a necrotrophic phase where they will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kill the tissue and extract
nutrients and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a brief overview about the life
cycle of spherulina misceva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the infections actually starts in
spring, where the pathogen release
[SPEAKER_00]: ascospores, where they will enter the
popular leaves through the stomata,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will develop lesions three to
four weeks after bud burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then during summer, there will be
secondary infections where the spores will
[SPEAKER_00]: spread to other parts of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will enter the stems, the branches,
and other leaves, and creating secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then during fall, the leaves that are
infected with the pathogen will fall off
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground, and then the sexual stage will
begin with the formation of the sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting bodies, pseudotica, and then the
cycle will start all over again in spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of disease management,
to mitigate spherulina misceva's
[SPEAKER_00]: infection, there has been use of
phagesides, but just as a preventive
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, because once the pathogens
actually established, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical treatments that were shown to be
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned earlier in my
presentation, poplar has actually a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization potential, which actually
made a substantial amount of research
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on the host site, either by
identifying and planting resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype, or through breeding program
efforts aimed at developing new genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be resistant to the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other management approaches aimed at
preventing the spread of this pathogen has
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on biological control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm showing here in this first study
in 2003, they were able to show that when
[SPEAKER_00]: they spray streptomyces strains in the
field, they were able to suppress leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: spot diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more recent study in 2021, researchers
were able to identify other Bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: villicensis strains that were also shown
to have antagonistic activity against
[SPEAKER_00]: spherulina.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem of those biocontrol
strategies is the limited longevity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial strains when they're used in
plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen in this pathosystem has been
overlooked for the longest time in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is mainly due to the insufficient
understanding of the molecular mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that drive SMC bus pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also this intertwines with the absence
of genetic manipulation tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's a lot of genetic tools,
as I mentioned on poplar, for the longest
[SPEAKER_00]: time, we did not have any genetic tools to
be able to manipulate this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made it like our primarily
objective within the CSFA is to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR genetic tools for this pathogen
that aims not only at advancing the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: research, elucidating gene functions
implicated in pathogenicity, but also at
[SPEAKER_00]: advancing applied research towards the
development of CRISPR enabled technology
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to control the disease and
ensure sustainable population management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the second part of my talk,
I will discuss the progress that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made so far into developing synthetic
biology and genetic strategies for
[SPEAKER_00]: combating SMC by and mitigate its impact
on poplar's plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will divide this part into three
subparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I will talk about how we were
able to develop CRISPR-Cas tool to
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically manipulate this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later how we leverage these tools
to uncover genetic determinants of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity and other genes that has
ecological functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we are taking this another step
further to develop CRISPR-enabled gene
[SPEAKER_00]: drives for population control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, for those of you who are not
familiar with CRISPR, CRISPR stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short
Palindromic Repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural defense mechanism that was
found in bacteria and that helped them in
[SPEAKER_00]: protect against viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later this natural occurring mechanism
has been adapted for synthetic genome
[SPEAKER_00]: editing in a groundbreaking way and in a
lot of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CRISPR is often referred to as the gene
scissor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it caused a double strand DNA
break in a specific sequence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tool actually is composed of the
Cas9 protein, which will unwind and cleave
[SPEAKER_00]: the DNA double strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second component of the CRISPR is
the guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the RNA component.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is composed of the tracer RNA and the
CRISPR RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tracer RNA, it will bind to the
Cas9 protein, whereas the CRISPR RNA will
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridize to a specific region in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to any gene of interest that we want to
knock it out or delete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CRISPR RNA is the part that we
actually designed based on our gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tracer RNA and the CRISPR RNA will
fuse together to form what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guide RNA will form a complex with
the Cas9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this guide RNA and Cas9 complex will
go and will search for the sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest that we want to knock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nuclease domains of the Cas9 would
be activated after the guide RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridized to the specific region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will generate a DNA cut or a DNA
double strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this double strand break that was
created by the guide RNA Cas9 complex will
[SPEAKER_00]: be repaired in an error-prone way,
generating multiple mutations or what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call indels, referring to insertions or
deletions, because they are randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most likely, those mutations will
result in the gene being knocked out
[SPEAKER_00]: because its open reading frame has been
cut in the middle and repaired in an
[SPEAKER_00]: error-prone way, containing a lot of
mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a brief overview about
the advance, sorry, the advancement of
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR-Cas systems in fungal research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tool has revolutionized actually
fungal genetic engineering in both yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and filamentous species, enabling precise
and efficient genetic modifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been used for various
applications that range from genome
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering primarily in yeast species to
create yeast libraries or to construct
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic yeast chromosomes, as well as
for metabolic engineering, transcriptional
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also recently saw that CRISPR has
opened up new avenues for actually
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting and controlling fungal
infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plant pathology specifically,
the applications of CRISPR-Cas tools are
[SPEAKER_00]: also rapidly expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these tools have helped improving plant
disease resistance by targeting both the
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and the fungal pathogens,
have helped deepening our understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-pathogen interactions, and has also
enabled the development of innovative
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnostic tools for early pathogen
detections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a first step in our efforts,
I worked on developing a CRISPR-Cas9
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation system in our non-modal
fungal pathogen, Asmiseva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm showing how the Asmiseva
spores look like, and then how after
[SPEAKER_00]: digesting them with a mix of different
digestion enzymes, how we are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate those bubble-looking structures
that are called protoplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are cells without the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use those protoplasts for the
delivery of the Cas9 guide RNA complex to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to generate the double-strand DNA
break that I already talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a proof of principle for the success
of this tool in Asmiseva, I targeted an
[SPEAKER_00]: oxytrophic gene called PRG, because it
allowed an easy screening on FOA plates
[SPEAKER_00]: when this gene is actually knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then randomly, I selected the 20
transformants from this transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a sequencing of the region where
the guide RNA is supposed to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I aligned those sequences from the
different transformants to the wild type,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was able to see multiple insertions
and deletions that actually resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mutation of this gene, validating the
success of this transformation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: success of this tool in Asmiseva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we have developed the
CRISPR-Cas9 tool in Asmiseva, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage it to identify genetic
determinants of pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fungal plant pathogens,
pathogenicity determinants can be either
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate-active enzymes that are
involved in the degradation of plant cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, which are a key part of the
pathogenicity of many fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have effector genes, which are
secreted molecules that directly
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate the host cell function and
allowing the fungus to successfully infect
[SPEAKER_00]: the host and suppressing its immune
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, we have secondary metabolites
that are specialized molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So secondary metabolites unlike primary
metabolites that are not essential for the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and development, that they provide
advantage for survival for the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can act as virulence factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the production of those metabolites
are usually regulated, as shown on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom right, by a cluster of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genes are clustered together and
they have different function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them can encode for accessory
enzymes and coordinate the synthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others encodes for transporters that are
responsible for the transport and the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual secretion of those metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have also transcription factors
that regulate the expression of those gene
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our study, we focus on those two
classes, identifying effectors and
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites that can be
regulating the pathogenicity of spherulina
[SPEAKER_00]: missiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to identify effector genes,
we collaborated with Dr. Jared Leboldis at
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon State University to conduct a
transcriptomic analysis on S.
[SPEAKER_00]: missiva during stem canker formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collected RNA at two and three weeks
post inoculations with the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this analysis have enabled us to
reveal 70 genes that were differentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed at two weeks and 110 genes that
were differentially expressed at three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks between the stem cankers,
like the RNA extracted from stem cankers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the control, which is fungus growing
on a media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among those genes that were
differentially expressed, the gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the highest expression at two weeks
and the second highest at three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: encode for extracellular protein to or
short for ECP2, which is predicted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an effector protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was characterized in other fungal
pathogens and shown to be responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was found, as I mentioned, to be highly
expressed during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did an infiltration of this
protein on poplar leaves, we showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: it invokes hypersensitive response in some
of the susceptible genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using our CRISPR tool that we were able
to develop, but this time, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: having a random repair, we inserted,
along with the CRISPR Cas9 complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: a donor DNA that has a 1KB homology arm
that correspond to the cut site of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA in the ECP2 sequence and contain
a selectable marker, HPH, that encodes for
[SPEAKER_00]: hygromycin, which will allow us later on
to select those mutants on hygromycin
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the structure of the guide RNA
that was designed to cut in the ECP2
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after doing the transformation,
we collected randomly 20 mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the PCR confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we selected, of those positive PCR
mutants, three independent mutants that we
[SPEAKER_00]: performed whole genome sequencing to make
sure that we don't have any Cas9 off
[SPEAKER_00]: targets, which is something that could
happen where the Cas9 would generate cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: in other parts of the genome and would
also have mutations not only necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: at the targeted loci, but also in other
parts of the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we confirmed that in the three mutants
that are independently selected,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did not have any Cas9 off targets,
and we have a cut in the ECP2 sequence and
[SPEAKER_00]: a repair integrating the hygromycin
selectable marker in those mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, we used those mutants and we
performed pathogenicity experiments by
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying the different popular genotypes
that represent a broad spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them are known to be
susceptible to SMCVA where others were
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see here, by looking at the
cankerous developments per centimeters,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to see that the knockout of
ECP2 resulted in a significant decrease of
[SPEAKER_00]: cankers per centimeters in certain
genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly, those genotypes were
the same in genotypes that when we did
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrations, were also showing hyper
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also when we looked at the leaf disease
severity, we were able to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant reduction of leaf disease
severity when the plants were inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Delta ECP2 compared to the wild
bock strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using this CRISPR Cas9 tool,
we were able to validate the function of
[SPEAKER_00]: the necrotrophic effector ECP2 that is
involved in necrotic cankerous formation
[SPEAKER_00]: on popular systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this effector can actually serve as
our first target for the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides the factors, secondary
metabolites were also our gene targets of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest and they also play a key roles in
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to identify secondary
metabolites that are potentially involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in SMCVA pathogenicity, we used
anti-SMATCH, which is an online tool that
[SPEAKER_00]: is able to predict biosynthetic gene
clusters in fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we wrapped this tool on the
genomes of all 122 isolates of SMCVA that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have from our collection, we were able
to identify, and that I'm highlighting in
[SPEAKER_00]: red here, a few biosynthetic gene clusters
that were either truncated or absent in
[SPEAKER_00]: the British Columbia subpopulation that I
talked about earlier that is genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the others population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, when those clusters,
clan 3030 and clan 3571, were absent in
[SPEAKER_00]: the subpopulation of British Columbia,
we also saw that these subpopulation have
[SPEAKER_00]: also a reduction of cankerous formation,
which made us think that those clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: might be the good targets and might be
implicated in pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had two of my graduate students,
Joshua Sparks and Cole Sawyer,
[SPEAKER_00]: who actually graduated last week,
working on characterizing those two
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters and doing the knockouts of their
background genes to validate their
[SPEAKER_00]: implications and pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work on the clan 3571 is still in
its earlier stages, and it's known to
[SPEAKER_00]: encode for an unknown metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit more challenging than
the work on clan 3030, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be focusing on today, because this clan is
predicted to encode for a metabolite that
[SPEAKER_00]: is known and identified in other fungi,
but not in SMCVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cole has worked on characterizing this
cluster that is predicted to be formed
[SPEAKER_00]: with 11 putative biosynthetic genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those genes, as I talked earlier,
there's a specific transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a gene highlighted in pink APNH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the role of this specific
transcription factor?
[SPEAKER_00]: When a cluster of genes contain a specific
transcription factor, it works as a
[SPEAKER_00]: switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this gene is expressed,
the rest of the genes would be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's knocked out or not
expressed, the rest of the genes would be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned off, and therefore we won't have a
production of this metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using the CRISPR tool, Cole was able,
and this is the guide RNA sequence that he
[SPEAKER_00]: designed, he was able to knock out this
specific transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later he conducted a transcriptomic
analysis to confirm that the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are also turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this specific transcription factor is
deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we actually confirmed that all
the genes in the cluster were
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly downregulated in those
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also conducted metabolomic analysis to
confirm that this cluster actually
[SPEAKER_00]: belonged and encodes for apenine by
running it through a standard that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: apenine commercialized standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see here, the wild type is
able to produce apenine, whereas the three
[SPEAKER_00]: independent mutants that Cole has selected
did not produce apenine on both tested
[SPEAKER_00]: media, PDA and GMM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confirming that this cluster is encoding
for apenine and all the genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: downregulated when the specific
transcription factors is knocked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also later conducted pathogenicity
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar to what we've done in the ECP2
mutants, we conducted those pathogenicity
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments by spraying different popular
genotypes with this pore collected from
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild type and the mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to our surprise, we were expected to
see a significant downregulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease severity as well as the cankers
per centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to our surprise, we did not see any
differences between the wild type and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants inoculated plants, which actually
kind of contradict our original hypothesis
[SPEAKER_00]: that this compound could be implicated in
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since apenine is already characterized
as an antifungal compound, we wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, since this metabolite is not
implicated in pathogenicity, what is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the ecological function of this
compound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really regulating the microbiome?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to test this hypothesis, Cole has
selected different fungi that are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with Poplar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm showing just results from two
fungi that were selected and were isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: from Poplar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lecaria bicolor and trichoderma
gamci, which are beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see, when the fungus is
growing alone, we were able to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also did pairwise interactions or
co-cultures where Cole grew his mutants
[SPEAKER_00]: and his wild type, along with the wild
type of trichoderma gamci and lecaria
[SPEAKER_00]: bicolor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see, when the apenine is not
produced by the mutants, we did not see
[SPEAKER_00]: any reduction of the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when we grow it with the wild type
and apenine is actually produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw a significant reduction of the
growth of both fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: In trichoderma and lecaria bicolor,
we saw a significant decrease of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here after that, we confirmed
that apenine is not a valence factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to use this CRISPR tool and
characterize an ancient biosynthetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster that was found to be providing a
competitive ecological advantage to our
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen over other Poplar-associated
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also, besides looking at anti-smash,
predicting what is absent, what is
[SPEAKER_00]: present, and some of those 122 isolates of
asmasiva, we used also another approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify secondary metabolite that might
be implicated in pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this approach rely on modulating the
expression of global regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we have specific transcription
factors, we also have global regulators or
[SPEAKER_00]: global transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are commonly found in all fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they regulate the production of
secondary metabolite by regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of specific biosynthetic gene
clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those metabolites were found
to be implicated in pathogenicity or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction with neighboring microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, when I used this approach
in my PhD, and in my postdoc, I was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify different metabolites that
were able to either playing a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating microbiomes or in
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this first study, when I did a
knockout of LeA, which is a global
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator, I was able to identify serotin,
which is a compound that I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that is playing a crucial role in
regulating the cheeserine microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a different study when I did it on a
penicillium exspansum, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest plant pathogen, and I did a
knockout of another global regulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: CreA, I was able, as we can see on this
apple, the mutants were nearly avirulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did metabolomics and
transcriptomic, I was able to identify two
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic gene clusters, one that is
encoding for patalin and the other one for
[SPEAKER_00]: citrinine that were essential for
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided, since this approach has
been proven to be very effective in other
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystems, to use this approach on
spherulina misceva popular pathosystem to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if that would help us pinpointing to
certain metabolites that can be implicated
[SPEAKER_00]: in pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a knockout of LeA and S misceva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we conducted pathogenicity
experiment, we showed, as we can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a significant reduction of leaf disease
severity across all the genotypes tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also saw a reduction of cankers per
centimeters in certain genotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not in the others, which indicate that
that could be an actually very effective
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies to looking at or identifying or
characterizing biosynthetic gene clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: implicated in pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're taking this to doing
metabolomics and transcriptomic analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: that would help us seeing what are the
clusters that are down regulator in our
[SPEAKER_00]: LeA mutants and what are the metabolites
that are not produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which could be like good targets for
pathogenicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, later we have to do a lot
of other validations like I did in my
[SPEAKER_00]: previous studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we are continuously working on
identifying genetic determinants of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenicity that could serve as targets
for the development of the gene drive,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually decided to start working on
advancing this research and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: started developing the gene drive on,
I'm going to talk about it later on the
[SPEAKER_00]: PKS gene of the melanin pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, what is a gene drive?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have an irregular Mendelian
inheritance and we have an altered gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: this gene would only have a 50% chance to
be passed to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, after many populations and
multiple progenies, this gene would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be diluted and not present
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when we have this altered gene,
combined to the Cas9 and the guide RNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which what we call a drive strain,
during the mating, the Cas9 would be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to generate a cut because the guide RNA
will guide the Cas9 to the specific region
[SPEAKER_00]: on the wild type chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this cut would be repaired by
homology directed repair, transferring
[SPEAKER_00]: this drive machinery to the wild type
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the wild type strain would
also becoming a drive strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gene would have a near 100%
chance of transferring to the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how a CRISPR Cas9 gene drive
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tool has been widely used in disease
vectors to eradicate diseases like malaria
[SPEAKER_00]: and Zika.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been developed on mosquitoes and
other disease vectors, but it has never
[SPEAKER_00]: been done before on a filamentous fungal
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to develop a gene drive,
the organism of interest has to be having
[SPEAKER_00]: a sexual reproduction or ability to mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned already in the
spirulina life cycle, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has actually part of its life cycle
when it's on the leaves, it has a sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, this approach can seem
particularly promising for effective
[SPEAKER_00]: population control in this organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a proof of principle of the gene
drive applicability, before we actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: right away and test it on genetic
determinants of pathogenicity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our overarching goal,
we decided to start working on a gene that
[SPEAKER_00]: would allow us to see an easy phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we decided to target the
melanin pathway because when the PKS gene
[SPEAKER_00]: or the backbone gene of the melanin
pathway is knocked out, the fungus would
[SPEAKER_00]: have an albino phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of looking a dark green or
black, it would have a white phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be easy for us to screen
the progenies coming from this mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to target this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something I did not mention
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have an active gene drive,
when the Cas9, the ELTER gene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA are localized next to each other
on the same locus, we have what we call an
[SPEAKER_00]: active gene drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it's generating traits that are
unwanted, it will be so active and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: spread over multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, since it's a proof of
principle, we didn't want to design an
[SPEAKER_00]: active gene drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to design what was called a
safeguarding gene drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to insert the guide RNA at
one locus, which would be our PKS gene to
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupt its expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to insert our Cas9 at a
different locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, the gene drive won't be
active enough and it will be kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: safeguarded and contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how our design for the gene
drive are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, we're going to do a
transformation to insert the guide RNA at
[SPEAKER_00]: the PKS locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have another transformation on this
train to insert the Cas9 at the pure G
[SPEAKER_00]: locus because it would allow an easy
screening on FOA plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a crucial problem for synthetic gene
drive is the evolution of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a mutation in the wild type
strain at the guide RNA site, the guide
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA won't be able to hybridize and
therefore the Cas9 won't be able to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a first step forward towards the
establishment of this gene drive,
[SPEAKER_00]: we decided to look, since we have 122
isolates at our sequence, we decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage from that and we did an alignment
of the PKS gene and we were able to design
[SPEAKER_00]: three guide RNA that are on conserved
regions, which can help us predict what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen in nature, making sure
that those guide RNA are not in regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that have natural mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we later tested those three guide RNA
on a substitute of this population because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot of work to test it on all 122
isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we selected based on this tree,
a subset of this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested them on a 29 isolates
selected across North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we tested those guide RNA,
so how does the test work?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually sequence a region where the
guide RNAs would be able to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hybridize the guide RNA and
the Cas9 to form a complex and we use them
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a restriction enzyme to see
if they will cut in the sequence or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like an in vitro test for
the ability of the guide RNA to test,
[SPEAKER_00]: to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we can see on this table,
guide RNA1 was able to cut in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: tested strains, whereas guide RNA2,
although it's designed in a similar way,
[SPEAKER_00]: considering efficiency, specificity,
and other criteria that are essential for
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA design, it did not cut in any of
the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guide RNA3 was able to cut in almost all
of them, but not in all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this quick screening, we were able
to see that guide RNA1 is the actual best
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate to go further with our gene
drive design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Josh was able to take this guide RNA1
confirmed sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after confirming that the guide RNA1
was our best candidate, Josh took this
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNA sequence and he designed a
construct that will cut in the PKS and he
[SPEAKER_00]: performed the first transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm showing some of the plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually still screening them by PCR
and whole genome sequencing, but just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to show how the phenotype of the
wild type looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like sometimes it's even darker
green than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how the wild type looked like,
and that's how the PKS phenotype looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, they have a weird
phenotype, which we're really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about because that would help us later on
in the screening of the progeny once we do
[SPEAKER_00]: the mating experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those strains after Josh is going to
confirm them that they are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no cast line-off targets and
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would use them to introduce the second
components of the gene drive and the
[SPEAKER_00]: strain would be ready to be tested in our
mating assay that we're actually working
[SPEAKER_00]: on developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you a brief background on
how we come up with this mating assay,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were first able to see if we were able
to mate the SMSiva strains in vitro,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tested the mating on detached leaves,
but also that was really challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: because the leaves would dry out and the
mating was unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we came across this bio-archive
manuscript in Zymoceptoria species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a closely related species to
SMSiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember in the life cycle
where we showed that the sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction actually occur on fallen
leaves on the ground, where the sexual
[SPEAKER_00]: fruiting bodies will develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this assay actually we're trying to
mimic the natural conditions for mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will use plants, we will spray them
with two opposite mating types and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: let the plants go through their natural
senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will collect those leaves and we
will put them under sterile conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use like Velcro to have a plates
upside down, plates that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection for our genetic events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those sexual spores will be able
to shoot and the colonies will be forming
[SPEAKER_00]: on those open plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later we will be able to look for
the ASCA spore derived colonies under the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope and we will perform whole
genome sequencing to confirm the mating
[SPEAKER_00]: and the success of the drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this mating assay is actually ongoing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have results from that yet,
but just wanted to show you the approach
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're following where we are actually
really mimicking the natural conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: for sexual reproduction in this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to conclude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I was able to show you how we
were able to advance the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR-Cas9 genetic tool in this non-model
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we used this CRISPR tools and how we
are still leveraging this tool to pinpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: the crucial genetic factors influencing
disease severities, including effector
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we are taking that a step forward
towards the development of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR-enabled gene drive aimed at
eradicating Esmiceva to protect and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain poplar plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although this approach offer insight
mainly on the Esmiceva poplars
[SPEAKER_00]: pathosystem, but it has the potential to
be applied to other pathosystem either in
[SPEAKER_00]: forest ecosystem as well as in
agricultural settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would like to thank the
CSFA for funding this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank our collaborators at
Oregon State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank my collaborators at
ORNL and my research group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank you all for your
attending the seminar and I would take any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Dr. Tanis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to open it up to questions
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please feel free to either raise your
hand, directly unmute, raise your hand or
[SPEAKER_01]: type in the chat and I will read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it, Galeon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you compare CRISPR-driven homologous
recombination with non-CRISPR approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: to homologous recombination?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean when we use a CRISPR for
homologous recombination where we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: use CRISPR and we use like a standard
transformation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, actually before joining
ORNL, I was always using a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation where we design our
construct that have homology arms of 1 kb
[SPEAKER_00]: to the region that we want to transform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after using CRISPR, I really see a
great improvements in the specificity
[SPEAKER_00]: because before when I was using without
the CRISPR to generate the cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: our construct, although designed to be
specifically going to the specific region,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw that it was inserted in other
multiple places in the gene genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we perform either whole genome
sequencing or southern blot, we saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: our construct is like being inserted in
different other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR has really improved the specificity
because it actually generates a cut and
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those donor DNA that we're
inserting in our transformation would go
[SPEAKER_00]: towards this cut to repair the DNA double
strand break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we saw a great improvement in
specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after we do a whole genome sequencing,
we rarely find insertion on other loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second question, regarding mating,
have you tried mating both partners on
[SPEAKER_02]: senescent poplar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So take senescent leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, we did not try that because,
yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another thing that we tried
and I did not mention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually think that there is something
coming from the leaves, either an exudate
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that is probably secreted
during senescence that could be driving
[SPEAKER_00]: the mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was actually Thomas's idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took senescent leaves and he did a
metabolite extraction by using organic
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able later on to lyophilize
this crude extract from senescent leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: to see if there was any metabolites that
could be secreted and be essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used it in an in vitro setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used those crude extracts coming
from senescent leaves into a media and try
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a mating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it's actually really
the plant material that is essential,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the just metabolite that could be on
those senescent leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we did not try it on senescent
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to go with the actual natural
senescence going on rather than take
[SPEAKER_00]: senescent leaves and spray them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that can also be an approach to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not directly related to your
extraordinary scientific content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things I was wondering if
you might reflect on for the sake of our
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate students in the audience,
what your experience is working at a
[SPEAKER_01]: national lab environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've had diverse experience at different
types of universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just wondering maybe to their
perspective, they're exploring different
[SPEAKER_01]: career options.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it like to work at a national lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how might they best prepare themselves
for that career option if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in pursuing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually so interested in academic
positions before joining ORNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a postdoc at UW, which was an
academic postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after working at ORNL, I really liked
the environment and the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing I really liked about ORNL,
and I believe a lot of national labs are
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, is that we have, so under the
same umbrella, of ORNL, we have different
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the bioscience, for example,
we have the computational science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the analytical group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do all our LCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the genetic group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really helped, instead of going
and seeking for external collaborators,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to do everything under the same
umbrella and same institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that it saved us a lot of time
and a lot of efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like each one would focus
on its expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be doing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, for certain people,
it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain people, they like to be doing
everything from A to Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in academia, for example, I was the
person doing the genetic, the analytical,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogenicity experiments,
and sometimes the bioinformatics and
[SPEAKER_00]: computational.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like at ORNL specifically,
we have this inter-teams collaborations
[SPEAKER_00]: where everyone works towards the same
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the CSFA, for example,
there's the teams of bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: geneticists, fungal geneticists,
fungal biologists, computational science,
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's within one science-focused
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of other projects are the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that that's really advanced
the science in a speedy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that answered the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it totally does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you might recommend
for a graduate student, perhaps,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a postdoc that might be interested in
pursuing a career at a national lab like
[SPEAKER_01]: Oak Ridge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything in particular you'd
recommend they do or reach out resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a graduate student, they would have
to be associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all associated with the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to take a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will take their classes at UTK,
but they do the research at ORNL.
[SPEAKER_01]: For graduate students, I think- I meant if
they wanted to be in a position like yours
[SPEAKER_01]: one day, like what they might do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a postdoc, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always have postdoc positions open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when we go to conferences and we
have a position that is open, we'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about it and what are the expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you would apply to every open
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of positions that come out
every week, not necessarily in our
[SPEAKER_00]: division, but there's several directorates
at ORNL and each one would have open
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a postdoc, usually it's for two
years up to a renewal for a third year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of transitioning from postdoc to
staff scientist, it's not always like it
[SPEAKER_00]: happened because at ORNL, they usually
don't hire people that do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, for me and Tomas,
we both are fungal people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each one of us actually does different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be able to be hired as a staff
scientist, you really have to distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself from other existing scientists or
staff scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where Tomas, for example, he does not
do genetics at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the only fungal geneticist at ORNL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that answered the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I certainly think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have time for one more
question from the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Isabelle Jacquemont Parks asks,
she says, hi, amazing talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned there are some resistant
poplar genotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if CRISPR is being used for
the poplar genome to address pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than the fungus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, the research on the plant
is way more advanced compared to fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a scientist at ORNL that does a
lot of CRISPR work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually developing biosensors
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to detect the pathogens at
early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the research on the CRISPR on the
plant part is way more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when I joined as a postdoc,
we did not have any genetic tool to even
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus was like really a non-modal
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you look in terms of publications,
there was barely like three publications
[SPEAKER_00]: on the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really challenging at the
beginning to start like from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas for poplar, the research is on
another high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round of applause or just kudos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone have questions or something that
maybe I did not touch on during my
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation for the limitation of the
time, please feel free to email me and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would be happy to answer any questions you
might have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Katie and Galian and
Laurie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for everyone for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
