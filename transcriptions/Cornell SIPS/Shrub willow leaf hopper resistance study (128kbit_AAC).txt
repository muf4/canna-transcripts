[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jane Petzl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with the Larry Smarts Lab and I'm here
to show you some potato leafhopper damage
[SPEAKER_00]: on eagle and bjorn varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the feeding of the potato
leafhopper damages the shoot tip and
[SPEAKER_00]: causes, this is called a witch's broom,
where the lateral shoots are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: form because the apical shoots is very
damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beagle and this severely reduces
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some more damage on bjorn,
same kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes chlorosis and necrosis of the
leaves as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our reverse leaf blower that we
use to collect potato leafhoppers from the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has suction and on the end we have
a bag that collects all the potato
[SPEAKER_00]: leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now that we have this,
we've collected this big group of insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to knock them out with some CO2.
The key is to put them to sleep but not
show them.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: applying Tully Champion and a pretty
resistant variety, which is 94006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a choice experiment to see if
given a choice leafhoppers are feeding on
[SPEAKER_00]: all three plants or if they're only
feeding on the susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the choice feeding experiment,
there were three different treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the low and high potato leafhopper
treatments, I released 20 and 100 adult
[SPEAKER_00]: potato leafhoppers respectively into each
cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 24 days, I compared the relative
growth rate of each treated willow
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype to a control that was not exposed
to potato leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in this chart, when the
potato leafhoppers were allowed to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: freely on the three different willow
genotypes within the cages, there were
[SPEAKER_00]: significant differences in their relative
growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The susceptibility of these willow
genotypes to the potato leafhoppers was
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent with what we have observed in
the field, with Jor being most
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible, 94006 most resistant,
and Tully Champion falling somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: between.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of feeding assay proves to be a
helpful tool when trying to compare the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to potato leafhoppers among
willow cultivars under controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I wondered whether the 94006
willows continued to grow well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: choice experiment simply because the
leafhoppers preferentially fed on other
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes of willow and not on 94006,
or whether they did feed on 94006 but is
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow resistant to the effects of
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find the answer to this question,
I also conducted a no-choice experiment in
[SPEAKER_00]: which 100 adult potato leafhoppers were
trapped inside of cages and forced to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: on shoots of resistant cultivars for 17
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I used Tully Champion 94006 and a
third potato leafhopper resistant cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: called Preble.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never observed potato leafhopper
damage on these cultivars in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was surprising to find that we saw
potato leafhopper damage and significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced shoot growth under the no choice
treatment conditions compared to a control
[SPEAKER_00]: that was not exposed to potato
leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on these results, I concluded that,
for at least these willow cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to potato leafhoppers is caused
by the leafhoppers preferentially feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: on certain types of willows and avoiding
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly which willow traits
deter the potato leafhoppers, but our
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program continues to capitalize
on these resistant traits in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed cultivars that can thrive under a
wide variety of pest and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
