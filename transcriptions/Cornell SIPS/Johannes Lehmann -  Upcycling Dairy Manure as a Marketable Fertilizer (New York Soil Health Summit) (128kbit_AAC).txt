[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Johannes Lehmann.
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach cell fertility and nutrient
management at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited to get together with all
of you and maintain the dynamics and
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasm around cell health and take
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to my team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of the research rests on
the young ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing generation of professional in
this area and provide a nuance to the
[SPEAKER_00]: story of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of the dark side that causes
some issues in nutrient management as
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and other substances such as
hormones, antibiotics, other endocrine
[SPEAKER_00]: disruptors are coming into our soils and
from there into the water so that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: faced with eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other ecosystem service losses
including no swimming for students in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer in Cayuga Lake, which is a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at ways of innovative
ways to bring waste to value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of these approaches, a
thermochemical approach is pyrolysis where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can show together with a company in
Rochester and a professional soil maker
[SPEAKER_00]: for greenhouse growers and homeowners
moment at high market and that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed transform a problematic waste such
as dairy manure, very wet waste into a
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable substance for greenhouse
growers that has a relatively large value
[SPEAKER_00]: already in the solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came up as a replacement value for
close to $2,000 per ton of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of dairy manure material that otherwise
would have a negative cost, AKA a social
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmental and commercial cost and
burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to take that forward because many
of the ways there is one, other animal
[SPEAKER_00]: wastes are others, but there are a lot of
different ways that are in our food
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in rural environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are point sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are in industrial food
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking with Anna Euser-Busch
about their wastes and seeing how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle them and find ways to recycle
nitrogen, which is a huge problem in this
[SPEAKER_00]: respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are discovering that we can actually
strip nitrogen out of liquid phases and
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitate them, bind them on
carbonaceous surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very new science that shows
that we can make carbonaceous material
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually has as much nitrogen,
up to 18% nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting into the area of a
commercial nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to find innovative ways to
utilize carbon dioxide to coat animal
[SPEAKER_00]: manure, carbonaceous material with CO2
functional groups that then capture more
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to figure out ways of
recycling solids as well as nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the gas phase that could have application
for both beer industry, but also poultry
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where we know we have a lot of
nitrogen pollution, aerial nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: pollution that then finds its way in
waterways and ends up causing problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: water resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have recently opened a pyrolysis
facility that works at scale and are now
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to work with industry, both farmers
at the end of using materials as a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment to recycle nutrients and carbon,
as well as industry that have waste both
[SPEAKER_00]: on farm and food industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the middle as large producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we welcome discussions about that and
are open for your wastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
