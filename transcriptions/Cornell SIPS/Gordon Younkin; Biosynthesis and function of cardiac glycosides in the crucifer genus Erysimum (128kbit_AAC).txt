[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, George.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I guess I'll jump right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: George gave a nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump right into talking about my
dissertation work, studying cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides in erysinum chironthoides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I want to start pretty broadly
talking about how plants avoid being
[SPEAKER_00]: eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a number of different
strategies plants take One of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that people might think about are
physical defenses, things like spines and
[SPEAKER_00]: prickles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have really tough leaves that
make it difficult for an insect to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants are also really well known for
their production of chemical defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an area that's been pretty
well studied because plants produce just a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive diversity of different compounds
that often have really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing two examples here of some
compounds that plants produce that humans
[SPEAKER_00]: are a big fan of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top, we have coffee here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, of course, caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the bottom, this is tobacco
and nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the plant that I study,
erysinum, which is a member of the mustard
[SPEAKER_00]: family brassicae, they produce a group of
compounds called glucosinolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are sometimes known as the mustard
oil bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are what glucosinolates look
like when they're intact in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have variable side chain here,
often derived from amino acid metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: and sulfate group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds actually are pretty
harmless as they exist in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then plants also have an enzyme called
marasinase, which cleaves the sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: produces this unstable intermediate,
which then degrades into these reactive
[SPEAKER_00]: products that you see here on the right
that are potent antipedent and anti-acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pathogenic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these compounds are what give flavor
to a lot of the plants in this family that
[SPEAKER_00]: we eat, including things like mustard and
kale that give that bitterness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these compounds have been around for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thought that they evolved about 90
million years ago in this lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of time for insects to
adapt to these defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a number of insects that
actually seek out glucosinolate-producing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a number of strategies for
dealing with these toxic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of them is the cabbage butterfly
here, which you commonly see flying around
[SPEAKER_00]: in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use a redirection strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a special enzyme that
redirects the unstable intermediate to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a less toxic byproduct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other insects, like the diamondback moth
here, use enzymes to modify the
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolates before the sugars cleave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a sulfatase that removes the
sulfate group and preventing the formation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the toxic compounds to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another strategy is sequestration,
which is exemplified by the cabbage aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sometimes known as the walking
mustard oil bomb because they take the
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolates from the plant and they
store them in their bodies to use them for
[SPEAKER_00]: their own device.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in response to this, herbivore
pressure potentially from these specialist
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate-adapted insects,
some members of the Brassicaeae have
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved new groups of toxic compounds that
can be seen as kind of a second line of
[SPEAKER_00]: defense against these
glucosinolate-adapted insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few examples of these are garlic
mustard, which should be popping up soon
[SPEAKER_00]: around here all over the place,
which makes these hydroxy nitrile
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosides, which kind of gives them a
garlicky flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candy tuft is another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make these steroid-derived compounds
called cucurbitacins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, my study plant, the
wallflower erysemum, which makes cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides, also known as cardenolides,
which I will just flip back and forth
[SPEAKER_00]: between calling them cardiac glycosides
and cardenolides because it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are steroid-derived compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can tell, because they have
these four fused rings from the steroid
[SPEAKER_00]: core, and then they also have this lactone
ring up here at the top, and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: often modified with sugars or hydroxyl
groups or acyl groups that might kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fine-tune and change the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as George mentioned earlier,
they have very specific activity in animal
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're inhibitors of sodium potassium
ATPases, which are critical for
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining membrane polarity in processes
like heart function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason, they're used in
certain contexts to treat some heart
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to their medical
importance, they're also a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial evolutionary and ecological
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've evolved repeatedly in a bunch of
different plant lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ones that people might have
heard of are milkweed up here at the top
[SPEAKER_00]: with monarchs, which are adapted to
cardiac glycosides, as well as foxglove
[SPEAKER_00]: down here, which is a plant you'll
commonly find in gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the source of the
pharmaceutical, where it's purified from
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am studying erysemum, which is up
here in Brassicae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my main goals were to understand the
biosynthesis of cardiac glycosides in this
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biosynthesis is not known in any of
these lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm hoping is, as we
understand the biosynthetic pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can give us some insight both into how
these defensive compounds evolved in this
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage, but also potentially in other
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's a relatively
biochemically and evolutionarily
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible defense, since it has
convergently evolved so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, what role these defensive
compounds play in a plant that is already
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well-defended, given that it
produces glucosinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so erysemum carinthoides has a number
of resources, some of which I developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, a lot of them were developed
before I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to point out to B.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seust, who's done a ton of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing erysemum carinthoides as a
model, including helping with the original
[SPEAKER_00]: genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a lot of the resources that I've
been able to use, including gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression from the 48 different species
that George mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a transcriptome-based phylogeny that I
used in some of my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also Madi Amirzai, who was a
former postdoc in the JANDR lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she collected a lot of the gene
expression data across erysemum
[SPEAKER_00]: carinthoides tissues that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really enabled a lot of this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But erysemum, in particular, is a good
model for use in lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's small and diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively closely related to the
model plant Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the resources available in
Arabidopsis are pretty easily transferred
[SPEAKER_00]: to erysemum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can grow it easily in the growth
chamber and greenhouses in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to develop laurel dip
stable transformation, which really
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitated characterization of some of
the candidate genes that I will discuss
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I dive into that, I do want to
go through a hypothetical pathway so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know what kinds of enzymes we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I mentioned earlier,
they'd arrive from plant sterols.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing here campesterol, which is an
abundant sterol in plant membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very first step has, for a long
time, thought to be the cleavage of this
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon side chain to produce the first
intermediate in cardiac glycoside
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis prognanolone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this enzyme has been known for a long
time in animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's catalyzed by a cytochrome P450.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started this research,
it was not known in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next couple steps involve the
formation of this prognane scaffold that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cardiac glycosides are built on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this involves a series of oxidation
reduction and isomerization steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: These types of reactions are mostly
catalyzed by a group of enzymes called
[SPEAKER_00]: short chain dehydrogenase reductases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty well characterized in
animals, less so in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there is a substantial amount
that is known.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some obvious candidates
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oxidation of this hydroxyl group to a
ketone is likely catalyzed by a 3-beta
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The isomerization of this double bond from
here to here, likely catalyzed by a 3-keto
[SPEAKER_00]: steroid isomerase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In animals, these two reactions would be
catalyzed by the same enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear that that's happening in
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: More on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, the stereospecific reduction of this
double bond with an enzyme called a
[SPEAKER_00]: progesterone 5-beta reductase,
such that this hydrogen is pointing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the page, which is a little hard to see
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the reduction of this ketone back
to a hydroxyl group, potentially by the
[SPEAKER_00]: same enzyme that catalyzed this earlier
reaction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we have a series of two
hydroxylations at two specific positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One at this 14 position here, and then
another hydroxylation at this 21 position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no enzymes, when I started,
were hypothesized to catalyze either of
[SPEAKER_00]: these reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 14-beta hydroxylation in particular
is not a very common position for sterols
[SPEAKER_00]: to be hydroxylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that one is of some interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we need to form the lactone ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hypothesized that this occurs
through transfer of a malonyl group and
[SPEAKER_00]: then cyclization, which might be
spontaneous or might involve the activity
[SPEAKER_00]: of some kind of cyclase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a bunch of enzymes that
are modifying the end products through
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosylation, hydroxylation, acylation,
that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, I'm going to talk about some of
the strategies we used to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates for cardiac glycoside
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out again here two
people who did a lot of this work,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marty, who's here today, and also Madhya,
who collected a lot of the data and did a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the work that my work was built off
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the approaches was a
phylogenetic approach, looking for enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: or genes that were duplicated in erystimum
chironthi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have been new genetic material
that the plant was able to use for this
[SPEAKER_00]: new pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also looked at correlation between
transcript abundance and metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: across a bunch of different tissues and
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did some gene co-expression, so looking
for genes that are all expressed together
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same tissues under the same
conditions with the idea that if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all involved in the same metabolic
pathway, it's likely all happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same tissues or under the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, mutant screens using chemical
mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I again want to point out that I did not
actually do any of the mutant screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Madhya did one round of screens,
and then Marty did another round of
[SPEAKER_00]: screens that resulted in some really good
candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we had these candidates,
we characterized them using a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was knocking them out using
CRISPR-Cas9 and observing any potential
[SPEAKER_00]: cardenolide-related phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one was transient expression in
Nicosiana to hopefully reassemble the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, either partially or in full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in vitro assays with purified
recombinant enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the gene co-expression networking
was one approach that was very fruitful in
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first tried doing this across
tissues of erystimum chironthoides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of surprised that we actually
didn't find anything with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no modules of co-expressed
genes that seemed like they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the formation of a
steroid-like molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I turned to another source of
variation that was available to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was the 48 different species of
erystimum that Tibias had worked with that
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned earlier that we had collected
RNA-seq data for for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: building the phylogeny, but we also had it
and I was able to use that to build a
[SPEAKER_00]: co-expression network of genes across the
entire genus, or at least the species that
[SPEAKER_00]: were included here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that did yield some pretty good
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this module of co-expressed
genes, nine of which were involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: core steroid biosynthesis pathway,
shown in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a number of other
genes that were good candidates for
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement in cardiac glycoside
biosynthesis, some of which were annotated
[SPEAKER_00]: as being potentially steroid-related,
but they hadn't been characterized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That included a glycosyl transferase,
two cytochrome P450s, and then two hydroxy
[SPEAKER_00]: steroid dehydrogenases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a number of other
metabolic enzymes that potentially had
[SPEAKER_00]: roles in some of the other steps that I
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those cytochrome P450s was
CYP87A126.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I expressed it in Nicosiana,
I observed the formation of this compound
[SPEAKER_00]: here called Pregnanolone, which is the
product of the sterile side chain cleavage
[SPEAKER_00]: that I discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like this enzyme is catalyzing
this reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few other groups actually simultaneously
found the enzyme from other species,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they did some more in-depth
characterization, showing that those
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are capable of using a number of
different sterile substrates, including
[SPEAKER_00]: campestrel and cholesterol, to produce
Pregnanolone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knocked this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Marty made this knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the first ones we made in
Erissimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the two independent knockout lines,
this is the total cardenolide-related peak
[SPEAKER_00]: area, saw pretty much complete knockout of
cardiac glycoside accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were perturbing this one
important defense, we wanted to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the glucosinolates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we checked those, and the
glucosinolates were completely unchanged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't seem like there was
substantial crosstalk or feedback going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is exciting because we learned
more about the biosynthesis, but this also
[SPEAKER_00]: gives us a really useful tool for
understanding what role these compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: are playing in an ecological context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing I did was,
with the help of Anurag and Amy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a sodium potassium ATPase inhibition
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned earlier, cardiac
glycosides specifically target sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium ATPases and inhibit them in
animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've developed an in vitro assay
that allows us to test plant extracts for
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they inhibit sodium potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm showing here on the left
are the inhibition curves from that with
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type Erissimum in black here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so farther left is more inhibitory
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a cardenolide-free control,
we used Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, we shouldn't see any
inhibition with that, although at high
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations of plant extract,
we do see some apparent inhibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not exactly sure what's going on with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was clear was that the two
knockout lines, in one case, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some residual inhibitory activity,
but for the most part, it was on par with
[SPEAKER_00]: cardenolide-free Arabidopsis, which is
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from there, I moved on to testing
the response of some insect herbivores to
[SPEAKER_00]: the knockout lines compared with
wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for these experiments in the lab,
I used four different insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them were broad generalists,
meaning that they happily feed on a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're likely not specifically
adapted to glucosinolates, like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these two insects were the cabbage
looper and the green peach aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also used two of the specialist
herbivores that I talked about earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: that specifically seek out plants in the
Brassicaeae to feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the cabbage butterfly and the
cabbage aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for each of these insects,
I did two assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was a choice assay where I put
them either in a petri dish with a
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type leaf and a mutant leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let them make a choice about which
they preferred to feed on over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of one or two days and then recorded their
choice at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exception to this was for the cabbage
butterfly, where I didn't overposition
[SPEAKER_00]: choice assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a gravid female in a cage with one
wild-type, one mutant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And allowed her to lay eggs on the plants
and then counted where she laid the eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other kind of assay I did was
a growth assay where I bagged insects on
[SPEAKER_00]: to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were either restricted only to
wild-type or only to the cardinalide-free
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant plants and observed their growth
over a period of a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found was that the generalist
insects in some cases showed a slight
[SPEAKER_00]: preference for the mutant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, they were able to perform
at least OK on both lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the green peach aphid, there was
maybe a slight trend that they preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: the mutant lines, but overall wasn't
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for colony growth, where I just
put five aphids on the plants and counted
[SPEAKER_00]: how many there were, after two weeks,
there was absolutely no difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things were a little more clear for the
cabbage looper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a very clear preference for
the cardinalide-free mutant plants if they
[SPEAKER_00]: were given a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they were restricted to a plant,
there was maybe a slight growth advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: if they didn't have the cardiac
glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were generally able to perform OK
even in the presence of cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this text does not look very good
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the two specialists, they
appeared to be far more impacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the cabbage aphid, there was,
again, a clear preference for the two
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for colony growth, there was a very
drastic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aphids I put on wild-type plants were
not able to reproduce at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them died in a few cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one or two aphids still alive at
the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were able to happily establish
colonies on the cardinalide-free mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw something similar for the cabbage
butterfly, where they almost never laid
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs on the cardinalide-producing
wild-type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they completely refused to feed,
even if that was their only option,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cardinalide-producing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they happily began feeding on the not
knockout lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will note, I refused to feed or began
feeding because most of them did still die
[SPEAKER_00]: on the mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a few of them reached pupation and
made it to adulthood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able to complete their
lifecycle on the mutant plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to take this one step
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I planted them out in the field this
past summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go too much into the
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had wild-type plants and the
knockout plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I visited a couple of times and just
recorded what I observed on each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the experiment,
these are the most common visitors with
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of observations at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far the most common insect that I saw
was this striped flea beetle, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: crucifer specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did not seem to care, at least in
terms of how often it occurred on any
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to care about cardiac leg
sites at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the turnip aphid, which is
another crucifer specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really because there were a few
colonies that were really quite well
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really draw any conclusions
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also saw a good number of snails,
as well as a lot of spiders that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: eating plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were building their webs and
living in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to give an honorable mention
to the woodchuck that managed to just
[SPEAKER_00]: completely chop down 22 of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also did not care about cardiac
leg sites, probably because they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually even eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just, I honestly don't know what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for two of them, I did get two
exciting results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabbage butterfly, like we saw in lab,
really doesn't like laying eggs on
[SPEAKER_00]: cardinalide-producing plants because it
knows, well, I don't know if it knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the larva won't feed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good idea not to lay eggs on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the snails also, which I was not
expecting, were more commonly observed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the knockout plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do anything like measuring leaf
area eaten by snails or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that they were almost twice
as likely to be found on the cardinalide
[SPEAKER_00]: knockouts suggests that they're doing most
of their feeding on the knockout plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that was all I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had on the insect side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now back to the chemistry and
searching for enzymes that are involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked before about this scaffold
formation step that involves a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: different enzymes that catalyze redox
reactions on the steroid core and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cisomerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were two good candidates in the
co-expression cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: To catalyze these kinds of reactions,
the two hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were also some EMS mutants
that showed promise here, one that Marty
[SPEAKER_00]: found, one that Madia found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with those three enzymes,
which are marked here about whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: were found from an EMS mutant,
that's the chemical mutagenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the co-expression cluster, in one case,
the 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase
[SPEAKER_00]: was found using both approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I used in vitro assays with purified
recombinant enzymes to confirm that they
[SPEAKER_00]: at least possess the activity shown here
in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so especially with this
3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of unsurprising that it's able
to catalyze this reaction, the oxidation
[SPEAKER_00]: of this hydroxyl group to a ketone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in vitro, I did see some apparent
isomerization along with the oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, it's not clear to me
whether that's happening spontaneously or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's actually activity that is
catalyzed by the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I feed this isoprogesterone here to
the 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see really very little isomerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this other enzyme, which I am
calling a 3-ketosteroid isomerase,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see very good isomerization of the
isoprogesterone to the progesterone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like these two enzymes are
working together to produce progesterone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is in contrast to animals,
where there's usually a single enzyme that
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyzes both of these steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in bacteria, it's also two
separate enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interesting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one report, actually,
of a 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase
[SPEAKER_00]: from plants that is able to catalyze both
of these reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still not quite convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like with some potential
spontaneous isomerization there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that careful attention needs to be paid to
that to really definitively talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: that enzymatic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this progesterone
5-beta-reductase catalyzes the
[SPEAKER_00]: 5-beta-reduction of progesterone,
unsurprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 3-beta-hydroxy-steroid
dehydrogenase, which is the same enzyme as
[SPEAKER_00]: over here, at least in vitro, is able to
catalyze the reverse reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reduction of this ketone back to the
hydroxyl group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not that's happening in planta,
I'm not sure at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually another enzyme in the
co-expression cluster that caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a steroid 5-alpha-reductase,
which catalyzes the same reaction as the
[SPEAKER_00]: 5-beta-reductase, but with inverted
stereochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the product of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen here is pointing out of the
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, it's pointing into the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this enzyme is called DEDylated2 or
DET2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly well characterized from
Arabidopsis because it is involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: brassinosteroid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so mutants to this enzyme are
deficient in brassinosteroids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like this enzyme,
in addition to catalyzing the analogous
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction in brassinosteroid biosynthesis,
is capable of using progesterone as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate to potentially produce these
5-alpha-intermediates, which might lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of cardiac glycosides with
altered stereochemistry at this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might not seem like a big deal,
but if we draw the compounds in kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way to give you more of an idea
about the 3D structure of the molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does actually make a substantial
difference in terms of the overall shape
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 5-alpha configuration here,
the fused rings are relatively flat with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other, whereas with the
5-beta-cardenolides, there's this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: kink that's introduced at the final ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the knockout mutants, we can start
to see that the presence or absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these enzymes might be controlling
the overall configuration of the cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides that the plants produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in wild-type plants, when all of the
enzymes that I discussed are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see production of these
5-beta-cardenolides here, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: represented here with each cardenolide
color-coded in terms of the overall peak
[SPEAKER_00]: area on the mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wild-type, we pretty much only see
5-beta-cardenolides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I have the little configuration
down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To show you that it is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pathway mutants, we see the
accumulation of atypical cardenolides that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't usually see in wild-type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we knock out the
3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get these cardiac glycosides that are
still reduced at the same position as this
[SPEAKER_00]: pregnenolone intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like the pathway enzymes are
using this intermediate that accumulates
[SPEAKER_00]: in this mutant line to produce cardiac
glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardiac glycosides with altered reduction
at the steroid core.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see something pretty similar if we
knock out the ketosteroid isomerase,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see accumulation of these delta-5
cardenolides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we knock out the progesterone
5-beta-reductase, we see a complete loss
[SPEAKER_00]: of the 5-beta-cardenolides and the
accumulation of 5-alpha-cardenolides with
[SPEAKER_00]: inverted stereochemistry at that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we knock out the
5-alpha-reductase, DAT2, we get these tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little mutant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can barely even see them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are the same age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cardenolide profile is relatively
unchanged, which is perhaps unsurprising,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't usually see
5-alpha-cardenolides in erysemium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbanthorides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we knock out both DAT2 and
progesterone 5-beta-reductase,
[SPEAKER_00]: we almost completely lose cardiac
glycosides that are fully reduced in their
[SPEAKER_00]: steroid core, and instead end up with a
mix of delta-4 and delta-5 cardenolides
[SPEAKER_00]: with the double bond at different
positions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with these mutants, it became
obvious that it was relatively easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the end products of the pathway
just through the activity of a single
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme in the middle of the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at some of the variation in
the sequence and expression of these
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes across the genus and saw some
amount of correlation, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: this progesterone 5-beta-reductase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of when it's expressed,
we get 5-beta-cardenolides.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's not expressed, we do see the
accumulation of some 5-alpha-cardenolides
[SPEAKER_00]: in certain species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to go in depth about
that now, but we did just upload a
[SPEAKER_00]: preprint bioarchive if you are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in learning more
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last part of my talk, I want to
discuss the two hydroxylases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: acting on cardenolide intermediates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we go back to the co-expression
cluster one last time, there are some two
[SPEAKER_00]: oxyglutarate dioxygenases that were
co-expressed with the other cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoside biosynthesis enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two oxyglutarate dioxygenases are a pretty
abundant type of gene in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they mostly catalyze the addition of
hydroxyl group or otherwise oxidized small
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules and are often involved in
specialized metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is this AOP1-like enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AOP1, AOP means alkenal hydroxyalkyl
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known from Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AOP1, the function actually isn't
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But AOP2 and AOP3, which are closely
related, are involved in glucosinolate
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of interesting that there
would be this close relative of these
[SPEAKER_00]: glucosinolate genes co-expressed with the
cardiac glycoside biosynthesis genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not in this iteration of the
co-expression cluster, but in a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: modified one with different parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also saw another two oxyglutarate
dioxygenase, which is a duplicate of
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxygenase for auxin oxidation one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an enzyme that is involved in
auxin homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It oxidatively deactivates auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two copies in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them has been duplicated an
additional time in erysemum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one is co-expressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one is co-expressed with cardiac
glycoside biosynthesis genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knocked both of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both are deficient in cardiac
glycoside biosynthesis, which is exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: suggesting that maybe they're catalyzing
these two successive hydroxylations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AOP1-like was pretty much undetectable
levels of cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: DAO1-like, I could detect cardiac
glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was about a 100-fold reduction
in total abundance of the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting to have these mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I really want to know is what
these enzymes are actually doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for one thing, what order they're
acting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for another, the position of
hydroxylation catalyzed by each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the mutants do give a little bit of
a clue to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the AOP1-like knockouts, some of these
earlier intermediates in cardinolide
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis accumulate to higher levels
than we see in wild type, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this one is acting directly on those
intermediates and might be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the DAO1-like knockouts,
we see really high levels of accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of an apparently, I guess, dihydroxylated
intermediate, suggesting that it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: the second enzyme to act in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these intermediates are also
glycosylated, which is why we see several
[SPEAKER_00]: different peaks corresponding to this
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another clue that these mutants can give
me is through feeding of substrates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants to see if we can restore cardiac
glycoside biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of these intermediates are not
commercially available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one somewhat similar compound,
this 21-hydroxyprogesterone, was
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only difference between
progesterone here and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 21-hydroxyprogesterone is this hydroxyl
group here, which is required in cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoside biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shown here at the bottom is the wild
type chromatogram of a mass that is
[SPEAKER_00]: commonly associated with a bunch of
different cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm kind of using these peaks just
to show we are seeing the cardinolide
[SPEAKER_00]: peaks or we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in wild type, we see a bunch of
different peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the AOP1-like knockouts,
whether I feed it progesterone or
[SPEAKER_00]: 21-hydroxyprogesterone, this was
infiltration with a syringe into the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves after 24 hours, we still don't see
any cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the DAU1-like mutants, if I feed
progesterone, I don't see much of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with 21-hydroxyprogesterone,
we do see those cardiac glycoside peaks
[SPEAKER_00]: reappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is pretty decent evidence that the
DAU1-like enzyme is required for
[SPEAKER_00]: 21-hydroxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also took these enzymes and expressed
them in Nicosiana and co-infiltrated some
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates to see if they were active on
the cardinolide intermediates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the AOP1-like enzyme I found readily
hydroxylates pretty much any cardinolide
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really seem to care what's
going on down at this part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am showing the hydroxyl group at the
14 position, although I don't have super
[SPEAKER_00]: great evidence that that's what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the other enzyme maybe
catalyzing the 21-hydroxylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so by process of elimination, this one
would be the 14-hydroxylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: This compound right here has been reported
in some plants just to accumulate to high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this peniculate swallow wart,
which is used in Chinese medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: this compound accumulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I feed AOP1-like with
pragninolone here, I see a peak with this
[SPEAKER_00]: mass that is also present in peniculate
swallow wart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's maybe some more evidence that
it's the 14-hydroxylase, although it would
[SPEAKER_00]: require additional confirmation to be
really sure about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I co-express both AOP1 and
Dau1-like and feed it some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediates, I do see that Dau1-like
seems to consume whatever is made by
[SPEAKER_00]: AOP1-like and produces new intermediates
that don't have quite the mass that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, they seem to be
glycosylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is likely happening by endogenous
enzymes in Nicosiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is one of the problems with trying
to rebuild the system in Nicosiana is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have some potentially promiscuous
activity in the Nicosiana benthamiana
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really what I'm worried
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm more worried about is that the
mass of these compounds actually
[SPEAKER_00]: correlates with the addition of this
potentially an aldehyde right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're missing two hydrogens compared to
what I would have expected if it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe these intermediates are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is something else weird that's
going on in Nicosiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't even know that these
structures are correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely active, which is
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do now want to talk more about,
I think both of these enzymes are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting evolutionary stories in terms
of looking at gene duplication and how
[SPEAKER_00]: plants evolve new metabolic patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I mentioned earlier,
DAO-1, there is duplicated in arysimum
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to other related plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the rice DAO as an out
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are all a bunch of other
brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's camelina, eutrema, brassica.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, in brassicae, there are two
main clades, DAO-1 and DAO-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in arysimum, there's seemingly an
arysimum specific duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here with presumably this 1G2O320
maintaining the ancestral function of
[SPEAKER_00]: DAO-1 in oxen homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this 1G2O322, which is the DAO-1 like
enzyme, that potentially has taken on a
[SPEAKER_00]: new role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at mycocintinine between
the loci containing these enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: interrabidopsis here on the top,
and arysimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interrabidopsis, DAO-1 and DAO-2 are at
the end of duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in arysimum, there's just an
additional tandem duplicate of DAO-1 that
[SPEAKER_00]: has seemingly taken on a new role in
cardenolide biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not showing it here, but we're working
with a collaborator, Cynthia Holland at
[SPEAKER_00]: Williams College, who just right before my
seminar sent me some exciting modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: results that are helping us understand
which changes to amino acid residues in
[SPEAKER_00]: the active site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have contributed to this pretty
substantial shift in substrate preference
[SPEAKER_00]: from this small oxen molecule here to the
larger pregnene intermediates in cardiac
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoside biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AOP-1 is a little bit more complicated
in that in arabidopsis, we have AOP-2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: AOP-3, which are involved in glucosinolate
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then AOP-1 here, which does not have a
known function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative to the one copy of AOP-1 in
arabidopsis, there are five in arysimum
[SPEAKER_00]: that are scattered across a few different
loci on chromosomes 3 and 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is this one over here, 3G34150,
that seems to have taken on a new role in
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac glycoside biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think some of these other enzymes,
I didn't mention, but some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: also co-expressed in the co-expression
cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like some of them might also
be involved potentially in modification of
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're good candidates for
further study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that also leaves open the question
of what about the rest of the pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cloned a ton of genes and didn't see
really any activity in Nicosiana for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although part of this might be the fact
that we're seeing modification of the
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediates in Nicosiana by endogenous
enzymes that might be interfering with the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of some of the later enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a malonyl transferase that seems
like a really good candidate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: co-expression cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't seen any activity when I've
tried to clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also some good candidates for
glycosylation and hydroxylation that I
[SPEAKER_00]: won't discuss further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all the science I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to thank, acknowledge all my
friends who really made grad school great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my girlfriend who also made grad
school great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of whom came to see me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, of course, all the people
who were involved in my PhD, who taught me
[SPEAKER_00]: different techniques, advised me in
various ways, collaborated on various
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: These five people up here are,
well, Marija, I talked about a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, as well as Marty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Toby, Ana Maria, and Julia are
undergrads who worked on Erissimum with me
[SPEAKER_00]: as well and did some really great and
exciting work and contributed in really
[SPEAKER_00]: important ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, of course, I want to acknowledge my
funding sources and my committee who are
[SPEAKER_00]: always ready with good advice and
guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be happy to take any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like a lot of your insects
were feeding on the kinds of part they
[SPEAKER_04]: analyzed on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were choosing not to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any ideas about the mechanisms
that underlie that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how are they knowing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cabbage butterfly, in particular,
are interesting because they just,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I can tell when I watched them,
they would land on it and then just fly
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wouldn't, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're scraping their ovipositor on
it or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like, yeah, there has to be
some kind of a recognition mechanism,
[SPEAKER_00]: even without feeding for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on their tarsie, they probably have
some sort of receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they are bitter, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of, I think they'll feed on
it and then it just tastes bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Byron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm intrigued by the involvement of DT2 in
cardiac behind-the-side viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if you know or
hypothesize anything about any potential
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in the crosshoc between
brass-linked RRAs and cardiac-like side
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think, like, if you applied
graphs, do you think you'd see an
[SPEAKER_01]: induction of cardiac-like side production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly, I mean, they're using
the same precursors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine, especially in the
knockout lines where I knocked out
[SPEAKER_00]: cardiac-like side biosynthesis,
which was like a huge sink for sterols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe the accumulation of those
might have led to differences in brass and
[SPEAKER_00]: the steroid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see anything with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do know that Cynthia, who I
mentioned earlier, did some experiments
[SPEAKER_00]: with Groen erysemum on plates with brass
and the steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think she saw anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: One interesting thing, what?
They had more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there were more of them with the brass
and the steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do some of those experiments,
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, apparently I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was going to say something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, another interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in erysemum chyrinthoides, there's only
the one copy of that, too, which it seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a little surprising that it could be
active in cardiac-like side biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's also involved in brass and
the steroid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other species of erysemum that
do produce the five alpha-carbonylides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know in some of those species
whether they might have a dedicated copy
[SPEAKER_00]: of DET2 that could be regulated or have
different activity compared to the DET2
[SPEAKER_00]: that's involved in brass and steroid
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was wondering, so in the plants
that make the five alpha-carbonylides or
[SPEAKER_02]: the delta-4 or delta-5 carbonylides,
do you think that those have different
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on sodium potassium ATPase?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I guess when we were looking at Madia's
mutant, it was more toxic to the insects
[SPEAKER_02]: despite having lower abundance of
carbenylides.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think this is doing to the
insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess these are mutants, but what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that there's definitely
potential there for differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely known that I think
the five beta carbenylides are generally
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to be more toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I've maybe seen some conflicting
things with that, and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: speculate too much without knowing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about what Marty alluded to was
with the progesterone 5 beta reductase
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant that Madia made, it was one of the
chemically mutagenized line.
[SPEAKER_00]: She tested insect growth, and she
generally saw better growth on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they grew worse on the mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there was a conflict between what
she saw when she was doing insect feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and when she was doing the sodium
potassium inhibition assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's also potential there for
different herbivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some herbivores, the five alpha
carbenylides might be more effective
[SPEAKER_00]: against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the five beta might be more
effective against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing with that mutant
was the hydroxylation was completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can affect the polarity of the
carbenylides, which could also affect
[SPEAKER_00]: things like uptake and activity,
which might explain why we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the feeding and the in
vitro assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: You said for the progesterone,
there's two enzymes working, and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: also seen in bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: For, yeah, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could that be like a horizontal transfer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's just converging?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's horizontal transfer,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look at the sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there aren't homologous enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In animals, as far as I can tell,
only has the ketosteroid isomerase
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't find a lot of information
about what those enzymes are doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's a lot to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I did still leaves a lot of
questions open, but I don't think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: horizontal transfer, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's thank Gorge one more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
