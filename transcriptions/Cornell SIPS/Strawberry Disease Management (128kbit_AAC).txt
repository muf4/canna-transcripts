[SPEAKER_01]: after one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This session is being recorded so that
people can access this later from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell Berry website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we'll move into the meat of our
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I want to make another
explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to apologize to Dr. Mike Ellis,
who is our guest from the Ohio State
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a professor and extension state
specialist in plant pathology of diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: of fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he agreed to do this months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason, next to his topic,
I wrote down fruit rots, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: root rots instead of fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he will be talking about fruit rots
today, which according to the feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: that we got is actually a really good
thing because that is a problem for most
[SPEAKER_01]: of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at this point, I'm going to turn it
over to Dr. Ellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mike, you can turn your microphone on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let you take it from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn mine off.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can hear you beautifully.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is quite an experience being on this
webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first one I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad it's working out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Laura's worked real hard on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My presentation, I've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I keep it right at about 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I don't go too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of things I'd like to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to emphasize I see quite a
few people on here that are professionals,
[SPEAKER_02]: educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the talk's really designed primarily
for growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, you'll find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's Mike Ellis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at Ohio State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here about 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been working with strawberry fruit
rots for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I start the PowerPoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you can just hit the little arrow at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope we don't have any more
technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get going.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, when I talk about any type
of disease management, I try to emphasize
[SPEAKER_02]: the importance of developing integrated
management programs for diseases of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be talking about
strawberry fruit rots here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the major components of an
integrated program are disease resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural practices, biological control if
you have it, minimal fungicide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I talk about fungicide use,
I like to use the word minimal,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the knowledge of disease biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, this knowledge of disease biology
is something that a lot of people really
[SPEAKER_02]: overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to take the first part of my
presentation today to try to emphasize the
[SPEAKER_02]: importance of understanding diseases or at
least having a basic understanding of them
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to be able to control them
effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knowledge is critical to the
development of disease management
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always say this to our growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, how can you effectively manage a
plant disease or actually anything without
[SPEAKER_02]: some knowledge about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the basic knowledge on ecology
or epidemiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you know about what you're trying
to control, the better off you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in terms of controlling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing I try to emphasize wherever
I speak to growers is they need to find
[SPEAKER_02]: out what resources are available that have
this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, most states have excellent
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know throughout the Northeast there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Midwest, we have a series of
publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Midwest Small Fruit Pest
Management Handbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It contains all the information I'm going
to be presenting on fruit rots here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the Midwest Strawberry
Production Guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has all this information in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to sell these.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to emphasize the
importance of growers knowing what
[SPEAKER_02]: resources are out there and getting them
and looking at them, learning from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit about the
epidemiology and control of strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I'm going to try to go through
the three major fruit rots and emphasize
[SPEAKER_02]: some things that we've learned that help
us understand them better and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: control them better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our three major fruit rots are botrytis,
leather rot, and anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with botrytis fruit rot or gray
mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a typical symptom on a ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a dead mouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's raised raspberries or
strawberries is familiar with botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably the most common fruit rot
disease and is probably responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the fungicides worldwide that are
applied to strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is symptoms in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I first started about 30 years
ago, growers in the Midwest and the East
[SPEAKER_02]: used to spray fungicides for botrytis to
control it from early spring, pre-bloom,
[SPEAKER_02]: through harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could result in four to six
applications of fungicide or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what was perceived was the
need in order to control this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to remember where to click here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to go over some studies that
were conducted many years ago actually
[SPEAKER_02]: that have really let us develop a good
understanding of this disease and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it really allows us to control it if you
clear them, you can actually see the
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium of botrytis within the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you go into the fall, the plants go
dormant, you cover up with spring and
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously this is perennial matted row.
[SPEAKER_02]: But underneath that straw, that fungus,
the leaves die, the fungus becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: saprophytic, active.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go out there in the spring and
dig out some of the leaf litter,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is a student of mine that was
actually studying sporulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: several years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put it, you get down there and
look, you can actually see botrytis
[SPEAKER_02]: sporulating on the surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to, I forgot how to use
the mouse on this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got it right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually see the fungus
sporulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a close up of some additional
litter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to get the handle on the mouse
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the point we're trying to make is
virtually 99% of all the inoculum that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from botrytis in your planting comes
out of that row in the litter early in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's most important that we've
learned is the fact that virtually all,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 90% or more of the infections
that occur from botrytis occur during
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is an extremely important point
and it really emphasizes the importance of
[SPEAKER_02]: having some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fungus colonizes old flower parts,
senescence parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually moves down into the receptacle
of the fruit where it develops a latent
[SPEAKER_02]: infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sits there because the tissue on green
fruit is not susceptible to rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from some work that we were doing
on infection of the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually this center berry right here
has a latent infection in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sits there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got green fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything looks great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the fruit starts to mature,
the fungus, the fruit physiology changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fungus becomes active and it causes a
rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see here that the rot really
developed around the calyx end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit or the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is when the symptoms of botrytis
show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you see in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past people would see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would start spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously if the infection occurred during
bloom, any sprays that you're putting on
[SPEAKER_02]: out here now are a waste of money and time
and a very inefficient use of fungicide at
[SPEAKER_02]: any rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope this is probably about the best
definition of understanding the disease
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it's helped us to control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know for control of botrytis
applications of fungicide during bloom are
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually as far as the success story,
I would say in Ohio now instead of four to
[SPEAKER_02]: six applications per year for botrytis,
growers just targeting applications during
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom and manta drill systems probably
spray twice, maybe at the most three
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at at least a 50%
reduction in fungicide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now anthracnose fruit rot of strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose is an extremely devastating
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very interesting and difficult to
work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the symptom on fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on a plastic culture berry
channeler and with several lesions on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These lesions are actually covered with
spore masses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fungus is splash dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a raindrop hits that lesion,
it just blows spores all over surrounding
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit so it can spread very rapidly in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, anthracnose was thought of a
warm weather or southern disease of
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberry was not considered a problem in
northern production areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got here, again, 30 years
ago, we never heard of anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose fruit rot caused by
colatotrichum was epidemic for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time in Ohio in 1991.
[SPEAKER_02]: Economic damage was not observed prior to
this date as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose once again, it likes hot,
wet weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1991, we had 80 degree temperatures,
85 to 90 throughout the Midwest and
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast from the beginning of bloom
through harvest with plenty of rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, this anthracnose epidemic
developed and it occurred across the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire Midwest and Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a planting of late-growth
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in its second year of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is on a farm near Worcester where
I've done a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about two acres out of 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, this is the second year,
the first year of production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful production, no fruit
rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year is 1991, the hot year.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grower called me up and said,
hey, we got a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing spots on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out and looked and within a week,
85% of the fruit in that two-acre planting
[SPEAKER_02]: looked like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's infected with anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely devastating.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was one of the most devastating
losses that I'd really ever experienced in
[SPEAKER_02]: a strawberry planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, anthracnose, once it shows
up, it is an absolute nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our big question was, where did it come
from?
[SPEAKER_02]: This grower, where this late-growth
planting was, had been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries for over 40 years and this
was the first time we'd ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our big questions are, where did it come
from and how was it introduced into the
[SPEAKER_02]: planting?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that anthracnose is introduced
into the field on infected transplants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some beautiful work by Mark Gleason at
Ohio State and his students.
[SPEAKER_02]: This leaf right here is a perfectly
normal, healthy leaf, but when you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it microscopically, this is a piece of
mycelium of colotactic macutatum actually
[SPEAKER_02]: growing on the surface of this healthy
leaf and producing a canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: These canidia are infective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another shot of some mycelium on
the surface of the leaf and canidia.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fungus can move around very,
very effectively on healthy-looking
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know if you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no indexing program for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it moves around and it's just
kind of a pig in the poke.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky, you got clean plants and
if you're unlucky, you have the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: for anthracnose epidemic in your planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know if you have it until it
shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've been telling growers and trying
to work with them is in growing seasons
[SPEAKER_02]: where you experience hot weather through
bloom and harvest, hot, wet weather,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should consider having fungicides in
your program for anthracnose control.
[SPEAKER_02]: In relation to plastic culture,
which is growing in popularity rapidly in
[SPEAKER_02]: Ohio and in many areas, the use of a
fungicide, a good fungicide program,
[SPEAKER_02]: for control of anthracnose is mandatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the nature of this production
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose is a potential threat all the
time and you need to have a good fungicide
[SPEAKER_02]: program for anthracnose control and
plastic culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, could I just interrupt for a second?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you see that question from Gwyn Smith
about everbearing and whether or not you
[SPEAKER_01]: can control well because of the continuous
bloom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you don't want to answer any
questions until the end of your
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I better get through this and
answer them at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an excellent question and I try to
talk to that primarily in my handout.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me go on through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people keep typing your questions as
they come to you and we can go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: them at the end of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an absolutely excellent question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between perennial matted
row and plastic culture is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of everything we've worked with and
the bulk of our production is perennial
[SPEAKER_02]: matted row.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is a good point in terms of
timing fungicides but I'll try to talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this down pretty well, hopefully to
about 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've tried to hang with that and I
think we'll have about 15 minutes at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'd like to talk a little bit
about leather rot right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leather rot is a very serious problem in
Ohio and in some states it's worse than
[SPEAKER_02]: other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually associated with heavier soils
and poor-drained soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at any rate, this is a typical
symptom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leather rot is particularly problematic in
that infected fruit have a terrible taste
[SPEAKER_02]: and smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the taste is just horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes people will see this white
area and think it's just under ripe,
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it off and go ahead and put the
strawberries on the shortcake and go ahead
[SPEAKER_02]: and eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tastes terrible so they know where
they got the berries and they're a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit upset about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also we found that one or two berries in a
gallon of infected fruit or a gallon of
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit will throw the flavor off of jams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So leather rot is kind of the producer's
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got even 1% of it and you're
planting... Mike, we lost your audio just
[SPEAKER_01]: for a second so I don't know what happened
but just maybe if you want to repeat if
[SPEAKER_01]: you said anything important we better hear
it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I don't know what cut out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everything is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway at this point I'm just going to
keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about leather rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll back up a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But leather rot is kind of a nightmare's
producer and the fact that it produces a
[SPEAKER_02]: very bad taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the fruit doesn't really
look like it's rotted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just may be under ripe and people will
use those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really results in some serious
customer relations when people get bad
[SPEAKER_02]: taste in berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate when we look at the disease
this is an infected fruit in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in time, these infected fruit
actually dry down and develop into these
[SPEAKER_02]: things we call mummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a combination of the
pathogen and the host.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard dry object.
[SPEAKER_02]: But inside of that thing is a thick walled
resting oospore of Phytophthora cactorum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this oospore can stay in the soil for
30 years and I'll just bet you any place
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's been strawberry production
these oospores are present in the grounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the key thing about this oospore is
it's just going to sit there until you
[SPEAKER_02]: have saturated soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the key to this disease is saturated
soil, water saturated soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get that for a relatively short
period of time they germinate and form
[SPEAKER_02]: sporangia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these sporangia then develop what's
called zoolospores, little biflagellate
[SPEAKER_02]: spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to a sperm cell that can actually
swim in the water in the soil and in
[SPEAKER_02]: puddles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore the key to controlling
leather rot is drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime I see standing water in a
strawberry field I cringe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a fruit with Phytophthora actually
sporulating on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bet that that water is just full
of zoolospores so every time a raindrop
[SPEAKER_02]: hits in there it just splashes the healthy
fruit and it's off and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got an epidemic on your hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding the fact that saturated
soil is important for this disease should
[SPEAKER_02]: help us to control it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me the major control for leather
rot are cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primarily site selection, good soil
drainage and use of mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I just went over those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like the first half of the
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tried to show you some instances
where understanding or that demonstrate
[SPEAKER_02]: that when we understand more about the
diseases the better equipped we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be to control them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think botrytis is probably the real
classic example where we've really made
[SPEAKER_02]: strides in understanding the disease and
controlling it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But moving on into an integrated
management program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again I tried to emphasize the importance
of disease biology or a knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disease resistance, cultural practices,
biocontrol, and minimal fungicide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first line of defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got resistance you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my extension programming in Ohio I say
leaf spot diseases, you better be looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at resistance for those or you're going to
be doing a lot of extra spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the past at least we've had some
excellent varieties with good leaf spot
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately we do not have good
resistance to the fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some potential for resistance in
anthracnose and some of the plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: culture or annual varieties but it's
really not out there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we don't have any resistance we're
completely dependent upon fungicide use or
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural practices for the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fungicides are very, very important for
controlling fruit rots on strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately we have an excellent arsenal
of fungicides for controlling all the
[SPEAKER_02]: major fruit rot diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botrytis, leather rot, and anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could give you a whole day workshop on
the use of fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a handout that's going to be
available to print off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura should be able to get it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate I want to go through and
mention a few things but this is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be pretty brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: For fungicides for botrytis we just about
ten years ago we started losing fungicides
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was concerned we weren't going to
have any but we have an excellent arsenal
[SPEAKER_02]: of fungicides for control of botrytis and
all of these these would be the the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cadillac fungicides over on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thompson I would probably put at the
bottom of the list because it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: around so long there's probably
resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Switch, Elevate, Pristine,
and Scala, wonderful materials for
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use them combined with Captan
early in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: The combination may help with some
fungicide resistance prevention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also using Captan with it early may help
prevent some of the build-up of
[SPEAKER_02]: anthracnose in the planting on those
apparently healthy looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose, Fruitrot, let me mention one
other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these fungicides are in different
classes of chemistry so they can all be
[SPEAKER_02]: alternated with each other in resistance
management schemes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anthracnose in the past we had Captan
and Thiram not really very effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Captan is not bad but you got to spread an
awful lot of it if you've got a problem
[SPEAKER_02]: with anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairly recently the Strobilurin fungicides
Abound, trying to use my pointer,
[SPEAKER_02]: Abound, Cabrio, and Pristine were
introduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really Cadillacs for anthracnose
and really gave us some effective tools
[SPEAKER_02]: for controlling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Switch is a fantastic material for
botrytis but it also does a good job
[SPEAKER_02]: against anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fortunately we do have some good
fungicides to help us in control of
[SPEAKER_02]: anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leather rot, we actually have quite a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, Captan and Thiram again were
the only things that were available,
[SPEAKER_02]: not very effective, but Ritamil has been
around a long time but it's very effective
[SPEAKER_02]: for leather rot control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Phosphorus acid fungicides,
Phos-Trol, Agri-Phos, Topaz, Profite,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Aliette are very effective for leather
rot control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Strobilurins again, remember these
Strobilurins these things are excellent
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides to help us with strawberry
disease management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoxystrobin, Abound, Pyraclostrobin,
Cabrio, and Pristine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pristine, all of these are excellent for
leather rot as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I have some suggested guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to print them out at
the end of this presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, contact me and I'll be happy to
get them to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've tried to outline everything all
my best recommendations for using
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides for controlling strawberry
fruit rots.
Yes?
Mike?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very good and I just want to let
people know that when we move to the very
[SPEAKER_01]: final portion of this program we will be
able to download your handout which is
[SPEAKER_01]: very comprehensive so I'll point directly
to that to folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a couple of extra minutes
so if people would like to ask Dr. Ellis a
[SPEAKER_01]: question this would be a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that one question from Gwyn
Smith about ever bearing disease control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well they're probably thinking about it
and we'll have another opportunity at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the program so that you can do that
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I wanted to check I don't see Scala
listed in the New York State guidelines
[SPEAKER_01]: for use in New York State yet so I just
wanted to mention that for New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple people typing right
now so maybe they know better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while we're getting that answer let me
change this and we'll okay okay Kathy
[SPEAKER_01]: Heidenreich is answering that and Scala is
listed in the PMAP so it is listed labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: for strawberry gray mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Alan has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of just other real quick
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all in relation to these
strobilurins abound in cabrio they're the
[SPEAKER_02]: best for anthracnose fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike we lost you for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike we're losing your audio for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one last I had some other stuff but
can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we can hear you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it went out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well actually I had a couple other points
to make here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay pristine pristine is an outstanding
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pristine is an outstanding material for
controlling strawberry fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a combination of cabrio or the
strobilurin and basculid which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis and a powdery mildew material.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is the only one fungicide that
provides excellent control of all three of
[SPEAKER_02]: the major fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botrytis, anthracnose, and leather rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for leaf spots, good for powdery
mildew, and it will give us some
[SPEAKER_02]: post-harvest control of botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention some things on
cultural practices but I guess I'll stop
[SPEAKER_02]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right we have one other question from
Chautauqua County.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about at what rate should
the chemical be applied and I think all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in the guidelines so you'll have
to check that for whatever state.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that is in the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I would like to emphasize is
especially when we're in plastic culture
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I'm making a spray for botrytis
or anything I'd like to include Captan
[SPEAKER_02]: into the program early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to help prevent some of
the buildup of anthracnose if anthracnose
[SPEAKER_02]: is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially in plastic culture I'd like
to keep Captan in virtually about every
[SPEAKER_02]: spray up until the point you have to worry
about visible residue on fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start getting fruit developed and
you worry about visible residues you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to back off on the Captan because you
don't want those visible residues and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these other materials will not result in
visible residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right great we have one other question
Mike from Allen and he's wondering about
[SPEAKER_01]: bio controls for these diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bio controls you know I really wish that
there were some things out there that I
[SPEAKER_02]: could recommend for bio controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But quite frankly there are not and I'm
not prepared to recommend them unless I
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're going to take care of the
situation under heavy disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there are a few materials out
there I've tested them but I just haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: found anything that I've incorporated into
my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right great and Sonia Schloman has a
great comment about getting pristine it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a challenge this year for growers so
buying a head is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Kathy Heidenreich has put the
link to the label for some of this the
[SPEAKER_01]: materials that we're talking about so that
would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you both for those comments and
thank you Dr. Ellis for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping you're going to be still here
because I anticipate that we'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have some more questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going to switch slightly to
Dr. David Godori and let me just try to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring up
[SPEAKER_01]: hold on this is the wrong one sorry that
was a practice one that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go sorry about that Dr. Godori let
me try to get your share screen on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Godori we're going to be looking at
his presentation right off of his computer
[SPEAKER_01]: because he had a couple of graphs that
didn't come through so he practiced this
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and it worked beautifully so let
me see if we can find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I think I'm going to bring
up a brand new share pod David and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just go right to your computer
screen and I'll let you turn your
[SPEAKER_01]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah there we go perfect and David you
could just click your microphone on when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great Dr. Godori is a plant pathologist
with Cornell University working out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural experiment station in Geneva
and he has done a lot of work with
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry powdery mildew and we're very
pleased to have him so David I'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: turn this over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: David if you want to toggle on your
speaker and Mike if you could toggle off
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: David try that toggle on toggle off a
couple times perhaps maybe it'll do it for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not hearing you I don't know if
anybody else can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay yeah maybe come down and toggle it on
before you fill up your there you go we're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching what you're doing perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now can everyone hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can put agree if you can hear him
it looks like they can hear you terrific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay good and well then off we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well good afternoon everyone as you can
see by the the number of authors on the
[SPEAKER_00]: title slide I'm the one that's talking
today but this is this is not really an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual effort it represents about
three years of collaborative work between
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's Department of Plant Pathology at
Geneva and some colleagues of ours in of
[SPEAKER_00]: all places Norway's National Agricultural
Research Center near Oslo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I come to strawberry powdery mildew
from a background of about 20 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: research on a closely related disease
powdery mildew of grapevine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I find intriguing about strawberry
powdery mildew are there many parallels
[SPEAKER_00]: between these two diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next few minutes I'd like to go
over some things we know and and that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about this disease because
we've only generated new knowledge on the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology and ecology of the pathogen and
we've also had to unfortunately unlearn
[SPEAKER_00]: some long established facts regarding
strawberry powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well all living organisms are are subject
to classification by a group of scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: who who call themselves taxonomists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now taxonomists are the the people who
choose the names for these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lot like tax attorneys in that
they they tend to create confusion and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they profit by it and the name of the
moment that they've applied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry powdery mildew is podosphora
effanus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will find that in in many other
publications listed by many other names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's all the same pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is only one powdery mildew on
strawberry and it goes by many names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to powdery mildews in general
I think we've been lulled into a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: complacency about powdery mildews in
general because for many years as as Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: pointed out we've had a wealth of very
effective fungicides that limit the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of damage they can inflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: However powdery mildews as a group are
historically among the most troublesome
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens with respect to fungicide
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact complete failures of entire
classes of our best modern fungicides have
[SPEAKER_00]: now been reported for a number of
different powdery mildews on on different
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's quite possible that we may
see a similar pattern of resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually in strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So resistance management and the minimal
use of fungicides as they're needed is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very important factor to consider when
you're deploying fungicides against this
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very high potential to develop
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this resistance inevitably occurs in
some of these fungicides there may be very
[SPEAKER_00]: little in the research pipeline that will
replace the fungicides that we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should especially concern us as we
move towards production in systems such as
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnels where powdery mildews can
develop much more explosively than they do
[SPEAKER_00]: in open fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've taken as the the inspiration for
this talk one of my favorite authors Mark
[SPEAKER_00]: Twain who observed that it ain't what we
don't know that's the problem it's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do know that ain't so and I've used that
as the the organizational organizational
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with what we thought we knew
that is not necessarily so and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: move on to what we didn't know until quite
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be reasonable to assume that this
pathogen like many powdery mildews infects
[SPEAKER_00]: the meristematic tissues deep within the
crown of the plant and survives winter
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy enough to find the assumption
stated as a fact in in many sources on
[SPEAKER_00]: this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trouble is that when you try to find
conclusive experimental proof for this as
[SPEAKER_00]: a form of overwintering in any of the
previous research it it's just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact when we stripped dormant crowns of
the mildew infected leaves and then forced
[SPEAKER_00]: them to regrow in confinement they
remained mildew free and significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: when we did not remove the those senescent
but persistent leaves a small but very
[SPEAKER_00]: important percentage of the plants
developed mildew on the new leaves as they
[SPEAKER_00]: emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the source of infection seems to be
those persistent leaves not overwintering
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't prove that the fungus never
survives in the crown it's it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to prove a negative only that we
can't detect it and neither has anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else to our knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: However these senescent persistent leaves
appear to be quite suitable for carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen through winter often very
well protected under layers of mulch or
[SPEAKER_00]: fleece and in places with with real winter
snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to return to those
persistent leaves in a minute but I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to first move on to the next thing that we
thought we knew but recently had to
[SPEAKER_00]: rethink and that's the role of these small
spherical spore containing structures here
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can see as I move the cursor
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those structures form late in the season
and they're called Pleistothecia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form in the mildew colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are Pleistothecia forming on the
underside of a severely mildewed leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no one had ever succeeded in
infecting strawberry plants with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spores contained in these Pleistothecia
they were routinely dismissed as a major
[SPEAKER_00]: source of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last three years we've learned
much more about these as sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: primary infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned that like many powdery
mildew strawberry powdery mildew is
[SPEAKER_00]: composed of two mating types essentially
male and female types.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the populations are
essentially divided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those have to be present and then
they have to be paired on the same leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: before those Pleistothecia will form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequently formation of Pleistothecia is
is effectively affected by disease
[SPEAKER_00]: severity and by time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be enough disease and for a
long enough period that the compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: mating types become paired on that same
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially they have to find each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they do the Pleistothecia are
initiated and thereafter they take about
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks before they look mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: However they need a much longer period
before they become physiologically mature
[SPEAKER_00]: and are able to release those infectious
spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the field that maturation process is
delayed by the arrival of winter
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in spring when the strawberry plants
resume development so do the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleistothecia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have more to say in a minute about
which leaves are susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when susceptible leaves are inoculated
with spores from overwintered
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleistothecia it's really not difficult to
reproduce this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are a functional and often very
abundant source of primary infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had mentioned leaf susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of reports in the
literature noting that powdery mildew of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry is found primarily on the lower
surface of older leaves and therefore the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower surface must be more susceptible or
the pathogen is very sensitive to solar
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those are reasonable speculations
because they're easily supported by
[SPEAKER_00]: observations in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The disease is indeed more common in
commercial plantings on the lower surface
[SPEAKER_00]: of older leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in fact when we conducted controlled
inoculations of strawberry leaves at
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of development we found
that first only the very youngest leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: were highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly there's no difference in the
susceptibility of the upper or lower
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly the upper leaf surface escapes
infection during the susceptible stage
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's obscured by leaf folding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how highly folded these very
young and very susceptible leaves are.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time that upper surface is exposed
the leaf has essentially developed
[SPEAKER_00]: age-related or what we call ontogenic
resistance to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that natural resistance of the older
leaves is quite suppressive towards new
infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the end result is that the disease is
often confined to the lower leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: until quite late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the distribution of the disease on the
lower leaf surface of older leaves has
[SPEAKER_00]: more to do with the opportunity to infect
a particular leaf surface during that
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow window of susceptibility than it
has to do with any other factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I said I would return to the subject
of the senescent but persistent green
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that often survive winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry is not a typical deciduous
perennial plant that sheds its leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: autumn.
[SPEAKER_00]: In powdery mildews of many if not most
deciduous perennial plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleistothecia are readily dispersed by
rain from colonies on the leaves and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to attach to the bark of those
perennial plants where they survive
[SPEAKER_00]: winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Cleistothecia on strawberry leaves
are very tightly bound to the mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: colony and they're very resistant to
removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact they're quite well embedded in a
sort of a rat's nest of these hyphae,
[SPEAKER_00]: these thread-like structures of the fungus
and that keeps them very well attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've obviously learned over several
millions of years that these leaves aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going anywhere and so why should they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well if the Cleistothecia are one source
of primary inoculum and the colonies
[SPEAKER_00]: overwintering on the senescent leaves are
the only other source, what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: if we eliminated both?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just completed the third year of
field trials in both New York and Norway
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without getting into too much detail we
essentially established pathogen-free
[SPEAKER_00]: plantings from either seedlings or from
tissue culture plants and then we left
[SPEAKER_00]: them unsprayed for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now even though these were within 200
yards of severely diseased plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're located in areas where both
commercial strawberry production is
[SPEAKER_00]: present and there are numerous wild
strawberry plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plantings established from clean
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started clean and they developed only
traces of powdery mildew during year one
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they were never sprayed with
fungicides and these were highly
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well nothing lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants were left untreated for
two years the disease eventually increased
[SPEAKER_00]: to severe levels on the foliage and
occasionally on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the experiments clearly showed that
the benefit is there from starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of disease was influenced far
more by the resident pathogen population
[SPEAKER_00]: than by contamination from outside
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the applications of this new
biological and epidemiological information
[SPEAKER_00]: on pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: First there are substantial benefits to be
gained from starting with mildew-free
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and taking steps to keep them in
that condition for as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing so you may first avoid
contaminating the planting by introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogen on senescent leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one source of inoculum you can
greatly reduce or even eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly you can prevent the formation of
Cleistothecia perhaps indefinitely as
[SPEAKER_00]: their formation requires severe and
protracted disease because the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: population is composed of two mating
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless the disease gets severe or
persists for a very long period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: those Cleistothecia will not form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only other source of primary
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly you'll improve the performance and
increase the longevity of the fungicides
[SPEAKER_00]: that are applied and reduce the risk of
fungicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to become increasingly
important as the number of available
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides dwindles and the remaining
options are inherently perhaps less active
[SPEAKER_00]: against this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now additionally the rapid development of
ontogenic or age-related resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry leaves means that it's the very
youngest foliage that has to be the target
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fungicides directed against powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you effectively protect those disease
they very soon become resistant and will
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer require your assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fail to do so there's very little
that you can do to eradicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: established and very well protected
colonies on the lower surface deep within
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll leave you with these words of
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start clean and keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll thank you for your attention and I'll
be happy to answer any questions and in
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever time remains and I haven't
touched on varietal resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can deal with that in the question
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much David and I see a couple
of people typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps we're going to get questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mike Ellis and Dr. David Gadori are
still here for some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please take the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a little bit extra time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were two terrific presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to while people are typing I do
want to say that some of you may have had
[SPEAKER_01]: some somewhat broken audio and I am not
sure why that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has something to do with
bandwidth and depending upon the usage
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps here at a major institution and
there's a lot of usage that may affect why
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not getting consistent audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's different for every
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I can say is that we did
find that people who are on a wireless
[SPEAKER_01]: connection that does seem to result in a
more broken audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that you might want to
consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molly Shaw has a question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says do dormant plants from the nursery
tend to come with powdery mildew on the
[SPEAKER_01]: few clinging leaves and how do you make
sure you start a planting without powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any owners of strawberry
nurseries on the line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way of knowing without a
microscopic inspection of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they carry powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very likely though that they do
although the nurseries tend to intensively
[SPEAKER_00]: spray those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much in the United States but in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nursery plants that are heavily
sprayed are thought to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary means by which fungicide resistant
strains are introduced and that becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular problem in the high tunnel
production which is much more common in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I couldn't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly if you're getting tissue culture
plants or plants grown from seed there's
[SPEAKER_00]: much less of a possibility or likelihood
that they're coming in with powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I think you just take your
chances.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of other people that are
typing and I'm going to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move us into the final
setting so that people can download the
[SPEAKER_01]: handouts while we are talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is for David.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin Pritz has a question about managing
powdery mildew in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the things that I mentioned
regarding the management of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: in field plantings become much more
important in high tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly if you had the option of growing
a variety with good base level of powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew resistance that becomes almost
critical in high tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're receiving dormant crowns and you
suspect that there may be powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: mycelium harbored on those persistent
green leaves you may want to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: actually stripping those before the
planting has started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thereafter you want to be especially
diligent with the application of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicides in particular as those new
leaves emerge and to keep that epidemic
[SPEAKER_00]: under almost continual suppression in
particular if you're growing a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew susceptible variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a question about wild
strawberry as a source of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's minimally important for powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Chautauqua County has a question
about recommending what do you recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: for application equipment to use for the
application of fungicides and maybe this
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually for both Dr. Ellis and Dr.
Gutierrez.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when you get into application
equipment that's kind of a science onto
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and ever since I started working
with strawberries this question comes up
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got range from people putting
materials on through the irrigation system
[SPEAKER_02]: through all kinds of different sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I tell people is number one I
don't know what the best system is but the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important thing is you've got to have
a system that's going to give you complete
[SPEAKER_02]: coverage of what you're trying to spray
and I can't get any better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say only that the timing of those
fungicides and the choice of the materials
[SPEAKER_00]: in conjunction with all the other things
you should be doing to manage powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew are probably more important than
the particular piece of equipment assuming
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment is suitable for spraying
strawberries in the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's well said there's no doubt
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's just kind of an
observation if you will if you are in a
[SPEAKER_02]: program where you are going to be spraying
you know you're going to be spraying a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the layout of the field is very
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to have some grass
strips that you can actually run the
[SPEAKER_02]: tractor on and have a sprayer that's going
to deliver out about 10 rows to keep you
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the growers that I know up here or
in Ohio are doing that and it really makes
[SPEAKER_02]: life an awful lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right that is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to draw people's attention to
there's two the fungicides for strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit rots that is a handout that Dr. Mike
Ellis developed and you can upload that
[SPEAKER_01]: onto your own computer it's very
comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a powdery mildew fact
sheet that you might also want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add the PowerPoint publication from
Dr. David Godori to this so you can access
[SPEAKER_01]: it later but I'm just having some problems
doing that right now but that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: available on the recorded version and I
just want to let people know they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: few more minutes before we even reach two
o'clock if anybody has any other
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura if you could make my PowerPoint
available I'd appreciate it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get into questions I'd like to
address that one about plastic culture
[SPEAKER_02]: versus matter grow in terms of the fruit
rot sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're right there so you can go
ahead and talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay first of all you know the difference
between matter grow the control of fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: rots and matter grow and the plastic
culture or annual productions is just a
[SPEAKER_02]: world apart and the point well made that
in the annual production you've got this
[SPEAKER_02]: constant flush or flushings of flowers
that need to be protected for botrytis
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate in perennial matter grow I
think it's a pretty simple system at least
[SPEAKER_02]: in Ohio we do very very few sprays prior
to the initiation of bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We target sprays during bloom and this is
fairly easy to do you've got to do it for
[SPEAKER_02]: each variety but you've usually got about
a two week no more than three that you
[SPEAKER_02]: target sprays for botrytis control and
then growers kind of play it by ear if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a normal year and it's not hot and
it's not extremely wet you may not need
[SPEAKER_02]: very many more sprays but in hot years you
might have to think about some anthracnose
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays or if you saw anthracnose the year
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate I think you've got a lot more
options and you can look at the weather
[SPEAKER_02]: more you have more IPM type things that
you can consider in perennial matter grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: In plastic culture I don't think you have
the leeway for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The investment that you have just the
nature it seems like the introduction of
[SPEAKER_02]: anthracnose on tips and on plants is very
very common and at least if I had my
[SPEAKER_02]: investment in the plastic culture planting
I would maintain a pretty strict fungicide
[SPEAKER_02]: program starting early in the season with
just straight cap tanned to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: populations of anthracnose down.
[SPEAKER_02]: When bloom came I'd have a program that's
going to control all the major fruit rots
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you look at the options you can put
together a program that will take you
[SPEAKER_02]: right up through harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty intensive but if you let
something like anthracnose get loose on
[SPEAKER_02]: you in those plantings you just can't get
back on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't quite finish my talk here this
afternoon but at any rate I did want to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention cultural practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Straw is extremely beneficial in the
planting for preventing fruit rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost all or all of the diseases are
spread pretty well with splash dispersal
[SPEAKER_02]: and straw between the rows especially in
perennial matted rows I'd never want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never want berries in contact with soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leather rot is just going to be a major
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate a good layer of straw mulch
we've shown that even on fairly poorly
[SPEAKER_02]: drained sites a good solid layer of mulch
will give you a very very good control of
[SPEAKER_02]: leather rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It protects the fruit from contact with
the soil even if you get puddling on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the soil the rain or the straw breaks
up the raindrops and it prevents it from
[SPEAKER_02]: splashing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very profound effect on splash
dispersal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even in plastic culture if you can
afford it there ought to be something
[SPEAKER_02]: between those rows rather than just bare
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more important in the
perennial matted row but a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: growers will put a layer of straw down in
between the rows in their plastic culture
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think insects are their own problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think about controlling these fruit
rots and the development of these fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: rots insects to me are not a major factor
in their spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are I'm just not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of their own problem that
have to be taken care of within the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall management program.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another question probably for
both of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chautauqua County asks if there's an
advantage to applying a fungicide now
[SPEAKER_01]: before you put the straw down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to go first on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When a lot of the real good work on
botrytis was done there was really some
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendous work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it by Sutton up in Guelph,
Wilcox and Pritz in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did some in Ohio but there were a lot
of things looked at and one of them was an
[SPEAKER_02]: application of fungicide in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to try it, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly not against the law but I
think it's a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're still going to have plenty
of inoculum there to start out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring and I think I'd put my emphasis on
targeting a program that protected the
[SPEAKER_02]: blooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did do some work here in Ohio and I
could never find any benefits from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd agree with that Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: For powdery mildew in particular the
Clostathesium has evolved to withstand a
[SPEAKER_00]: very harsh environment and it's very
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resistant to penetration by
fungicides that are applied in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're much better off reducing the amount
of disease and that alone will prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: formation of the overwintering structure
than you would be in trying to eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: it once it's formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time fall rolls around it's really
too late to do much about powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: for the following year in terms of
applying a fungicide to get at the
[SPEAKER_00]: overwintering stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a good question and it's been looked
at but like I said I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit I did not have time and I
apologize to put any final polling
[SPEAKER_01]: questions to you folks but I do hope that
you enjoyed these talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were absolutely wonderful
and it's great to be able to have access
[SPEAKER_01]: to nationally known experts on these
topics so it's really nice without having
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive to Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have both Dr. David Goddory
and Dr. Mike Ellison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura I'd like to make one more comment
before we break up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave didn't mention anything about
varietal susceptibility but for me one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the major things that I try to push in my
extension programs mainly for leaf spots
[SPEAKER_02]: and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an expert on powdery mildew but
you know we have some very good resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: and especially when I first started
working with strawberries the varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of our USDA program and Gene
Galletta they really had excellent and
[SPEAKER_02]: still do have excellent resistance to the
leaf spots and a lot of varieties you just
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to spray for powdery mildew and
then all of a sudden we'll start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: some introduced and they're just
indicators for powdery mildew and leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: spot and I try to tell our growers well
you really better check these varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: out and if you're dealing with a case of
extreme susceptibility you ought to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid it or you're going to be spraying
and I still think we have some excellent
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance in a lot of different varieties
that people could take advantage of and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's especially true resistance when we
talk about the root rot diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really need to emphasize the use of
resistance whenever we can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go along with that Mike especially
as you move towards high tunnel production
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew is is not routinely
destructive under field conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is routinely destructive in high
tunnels in particular when you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a mildew susceptible variety and so very
often we develop these attachments to
[SPEAKER_00]: certain varieties because they have just
well they have wonderful taste good
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural properties and in field
plantings we can manage powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: with fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different world as you quickly
find out when you move into high tunnel
[SPEAKER_00]: production and the resistant varieties
there it just makes a lot of sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with that as the as the base of the
disease management.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right those are wonderful points and
there is a question about powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant varieties in our in our
particular guidelines we don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: listed we'd have some that are definitely
susceptible and that those would be listed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the guidelines but maybe maybe Mike or
David you have some that you know are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually resistant to powdery mildew that
you could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have them memorized but in all of
our literature and I know in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mid-Atlantic Berry guide and in our
literature there's tables that have the
[SPEAKER_02]: relative susceptibility for almost you
know most of the currently used varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think the information is fairly
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few kind of stick out in mind that are
extremely susceptible this Darselect is
[SPEAKER_02]: one that is really an indicator for
powdery mildew but that's another reason I
[SPEAKER_02]: like to emphasize you know having these
resources this information having it and
[SPEAKER_02]: and referring to it but I'm sure that you
all have some information on relative
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptibility of the varieties to leaf
spots and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check the the extension resources
online or the published resources to see
[SPEAKER_00]: not only what's resistant to powdery
mildew but what has some pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: broad-based resistance to some of the
other diseases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a resistant variety
to powdery mildew and then you know take
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort in that as it as it rots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah you know one thing I was up
talking to the growers in Nova Scotia
[SPEAKER_02]: several years ago and I didn't realize you
know leaf scorch it just never seemed like
[SPEAKER_02]: a serious disease to me never saw it much
it's because we have excellent resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess up there it's just a horrible
disease and if you don't have leaf scorch
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance you don't you don't raise
strawberries up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well thank you guys very much I will try
to get my hands on a table and also post
[SPEAKER_01]: that in this file share so that people can
access that quickly for both some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other diseases leaf leaf spots as well as
fruit rots and certainly powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: will try to make sure that that is
available to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again I want to thank the speakers I want
to thank all of you that have joined this
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar I want to draw your attention to
the fact that the next webinar is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the series that will be on a Friday
it's Friday October 30th at 1 o'clock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the afternoon again all of you that are
registered will receive the connection
[SPEAKER_01]: information for that and that will be on
weed control and strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Marvin Pritz and Dr. Robin Belander
will be talking about cultural and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical control options and I also want
to urge those of you who have enjoyed
[SPEAKER_01]: these to please let other people know
especially growers who might be somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: reluctant to try this particular form of
program delivery we think it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible and I think they're going to be
pleased with how easy it is and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the lectures so please talk to
your colleagues and other growers and
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers we'd love to have more people we
have room for about a hundred people to to
[SPEAKER_01]: join in on one lecture as a live lecture
so I just want to urge you we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a little PR blast so you'll hear more
about us in the near future and thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: again for attending.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you
