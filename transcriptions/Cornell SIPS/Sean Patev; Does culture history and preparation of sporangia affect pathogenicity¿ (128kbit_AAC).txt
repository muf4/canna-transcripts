[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk to everybody about
inoculum, phytoplanktestin's inoculum,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a pretty basic part of all the
experiments, but I'm going to make the
[SPEAKER_03]: argument that it's a pretty important
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, the title is, Does Inoculum
History and Preparation Affect
[SPEAKER_03]: Pathogenicity?
[SPEAKER_03]: But to explain it a little bit clearer,
when we're talking about phytoplanktestin,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we're investigating phytoplanktestin,
does the substrate that we grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest, the sporangium that we use for
inoculum, does that substrate affect the
[SPEAKER_03]: disease that's caused downstream in the
experiments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it really affect the disease
phenotype that we get from this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the reason this is an issue,
the reason that I thought this would be
[SPEAKER_03]: worth investigating, is that among the
community, among those of us that study
[SPEAKER_03]: phytoplanktestins, there's not a lot of
standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way in which it's grown, the substrate
that it's grown, is pretty variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have it grown on live tissue,
generally on detached leaflets,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is how we like to do it in the
PhryLab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be grown in pure culture on a whole
bunch of different auger media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then resulting from this variation,
you often get these really disparate
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrations used for inoculum for
spraying plants or inoculating individual
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces of tissue, all the way from 300
spray engines per mil to upwards of
[SPEAKER_03]: 150,000 spray engines per mil,
which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a fairly recent paper out of
our lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Paola in this paper was using inoculum
derived from leaflets, from detached
[SPEAKER_03]: leaflets, how we generally do it in our
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said that she wanted to use it
coming from leaflets because it would more
[SPEAKER_03]: closely represent the inoculum that we
would see in the field than an actual
[SPEAKER_03]: infection coming from other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we see, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't come from cultures in the
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's generally the rationale used
when we're trying to decide if we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to use it from leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she used it at about 4,000 spray
engines per mil, which is what we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: using things at in the lab recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: But while this makes a lot of sense to me,
and this is how I've done all my
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments, this certainly isn't the
standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up here, this is actually the most
recently published paper on phytophthora
[SPEAKER_03]: infestans on the internet, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: This came out last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got their inoculum from raw
agriculture, from pure culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they washed the spray engine from the
culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually use concentrations very
similarly to what we use, about 4,000
[SPEAKER_03]: spray engines per mil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look at another paper,
this is from 2008.
[SPEAKER_03]: These folks, again, washed their spray
engine from pure culture, from other
[SPEAKER_03]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they inoculated their plants at
150,000 spray engines per mil,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that spray engine, especially in
distilled water, it looks like milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cloudy in the spray engine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an astronomical amount of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You often get concentrations in the 50,000
to 60,000 range.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys washed it from leaf tissue,
from actual sporadic tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's generally if you wash moist
chambers with tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the concentration you get in a
falcon tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all the way at the low end of the
spectrum, this is a much older paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were using 300 spray engines per mil
to inoculate plants in high tunnels,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's this huge variation,
just to try and get disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: That in itself should say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: This can't not be causing anything when
you've got a difference of 1,000 times the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have other evidence to actually
back up that the way that we get our
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculum, the substrate that it came off
of, has a big impact on things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some data from recent studies,
some recent work that was done on
[SPEAKER_03]: arachidonic acid, conferring a resistance
phenotype to potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you treat some potatoes with
arachidonic acid, and you have untreated
[SPEAKER_03]: controls, and then you apply phytophthic
festins inoculant to them, you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: really notable difference in disease
expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for this experiment, it was taken from
pure culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was washed from rye out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they inoculated and assessed disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you did this experiment,
and you got these results, and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: repeated in a well-set up study,
you would probably make the assumption,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think you would rightfully make the
assumption that, yeah, wow, we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: This really, really does sound better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you repeat the same experiment,
down to the T, the only difference being
[SPEAKER_03]: that our inoculum of the same isolate now
has come from sporulating plant material
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of coming from a pure culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That phenotype we saw before is
essentially gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could not draw the same conclusions
from this experiment as you could from the
[SPEAKER_03]: one before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that's different here
is how we got our sporangia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that it's a really
important thing to be considered,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it can often be overlooked in these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really, my hypothesis that I'm
looking at for this whole thing is that
[SPEAKER_03]: the substrate that phytophthic festins is
grown on, and that this sporangia is
[SPEAKER_03]: collected from, really does induce some
kind of significant change to this
[SPEAKER_03]: sporangia, some sort of epigenetic change
to this sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that change then affects the
disease downstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: The disease that we get in the
experiments, we've used this inoculum
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do we get into this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's most simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: We compare the inoculum of some isolated
phytophthic festins, grown in pure culture
[SPEAKER_03]: and grown on live tissue, on leaf tissue,
and do an inoculation experiment with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and see how the disease progresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not particularly complicated,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the download of the product,
the way the quality is, is really kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that we planned it and executed
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really, the first goal is to do an
inoculation experiment and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: confirm that there really is a phenotypic
difference between inoculum that we source
[SPEAKER_03]: from actual plant material and inoculum
that we source from pure culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just done by assessing the
overall disease that is inoculated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I really wanted to look into the
legacy behind this, try and look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic differences that's going on here,
to try and maybe see why we're seeing this
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the big component of that was total
gene expression in tomato tissue,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I do these infection studies,
I can sample tissue on the time course and
[SPEAKER_03]: then extract the RNA out of that tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tissue has post-gene expression,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomato gene expression and phytophthora
gene expression within it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can look at the interaction
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then actually, as the experiment came
together, and we did more thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: it, it became apparent that actually the
gene expression within that inoculum
[SPEAKER_03]: itself, the stuff that I would be spraying
on the plants is really important too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the pure, concentrated inoculum
coming from pure culture and coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: sporulating live tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so looking into the gene expression of
that inoculum became a really important
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first part is actually assessing
these inoculum sources, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually looking at the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the considerations that I wanted to
really keep in mind while I was planning
[SPEAKER_03]: the experiment was I wanted to use more
than one isolate of phytophthora
[SPEAKER_03]: infestans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want it to just be a fluke,
just some artifact that only one isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: was representing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those isolates had to all be within
the same clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clonal lineages of phytophthora infestans
are pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have different infection rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have different preferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: They behave differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had to be within the same clonal
lineage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to keep it consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted all my material to come from
phytophthora that was collected in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York State on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to do the experiment in
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to keep that
consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I really wanted to keep an eye on
inoculum concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw that there's a huge variation in
inoculum concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And change in concentration really can
impact the way that the disease goes
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to make sure that it was
pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the two isolates that I ended up using
for this experiment were both US-23s.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one, which you can see on the
top here, I referred to as Newark Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I referred to as Newark Valley for the
rest of the experiment simply because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was collected from Newark Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came in as a disease sample to be
checked for clonal lineage to be
[SPEAKER_03]: identified by our lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came in just this past summer,
last June.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truly less than weeks before I used it in
the experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, really fresh from the
field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to support this experiment,
I selected an isolate called 140112.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just our lab nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we keep track of our isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also a US-23 collected from Tobito
in New York State almost exactly a year
[SPEAKER_03]: before we got Newark Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had been kept the way that we keep
all our cultures in the lab, in Ryogre,
[SPEAKER_03]: transferred periodically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with my two starting cultures,
140112, which is in its plate,
[SPEAKER_03]: in its storage medium in Newark Valley and
off of a field sample, they had to be
[SPEAKER_03]: transferred to the differential medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 140112 I needed growing on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In pure culture and on leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Newark Valley I needed growing in pure
culture and on leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this first step here is actually no
trivial task as anybody who's worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: phytopthera can attest to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Bill said, something that I
struggled with as an undergraduate before
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primarily this step and this step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting storage phytopthera off of a slow
growing media onto leaflets is not as
[SPEAKER_03]: simple as just putting our cube on and
letting it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a bit of work to get it
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially, you know, we've only got
one or two plates in storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a lot of plates to make a
bunch of inoculants and spread leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a non-trivial task too,
getting it actually from a field isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: into culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just bring a piece of tissue over,
you end up with contamination and all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of local things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to use, you know, our cubes and
actually transfer sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really have to give all thanks for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Kev, he, Kev processed all these
samples and he really got everything
[SPEAKER_03]: going, which was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after I get these going, this can be
thought of as like a lab stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to use that as the first
source of inoculum because it's just been
[SPEAKER_03]: transferred into our cubes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are transferred out to their
equivalent media one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is the inoculum source for
the first field trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had field trials and lab trials
because when we look at phytopthera
[SPEAKER_03]: infection experiments, they're field
trials, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We get the spray plants on the farm
setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are lots and lots of lab
experiments with individual leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had roughly five trials going on
and I needed a lot of inoculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the inoculum was prepared on their
respective plates and leaflets and then
[SPEAKER_03]: flooded from their source and used as
inoculum in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was also used to inoculate the next
generation of inoculum in the next trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after it was washed, I adjusted the
concentration to 5,000 spray engine per
[SPEAKER_03]: mil, which is pretty similar to what other
experiments we're using in the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the same concentrations that we're
using for other experiments that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The spray engines are incubated in the
fridge for half an hour to promote
[SPEAKER_03]: germination in zoospore release because
that really helps with getting infection
[SPEAKER_03]: later down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after they had germinated,
I put them back on the hemocytometer under
[SPEAKER_03]: the microscope to double check
concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted to make sure the
concentrations were all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to assess germination,
I wanted to make sure that I wasn't seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: that the leaflet drive spray engine were
all germinating happily and lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: zoospores were being released.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plate ones had just not
germinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: That in itself could be causing a
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily, actually, there wasn't much
of a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all happily germinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then those suspensions were put into an
aerosol sprayer, just like this one,
[SPEAKER_03]: and brought out to the field or into the
lab to inoculate my plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used five mils total of that
concentration in the field plots because
[SPEAKER_03]: they were multi-plant plots.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only a mil for the lab experiments
because they were just plates,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were much smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was the same amount of material per
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the experiments, I had two field
trials that were done at the farm down in
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeville this past summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The two trials were comprised of three
blocks each, randomized complete blocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was essentially 10 treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can think of it as five treatments
doubled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those treatments were a water control
to make sure that I had a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_03]: reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: One for 0.112, the older isolate from
leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: One for 0.112 from pure culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Newark Valley, the newer isolate from
leaflets in Newark Valley from pure
[SPEAKER_03]: culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were four different inoculant
types along with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that the treatments were
doubled and duplicate was because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: collecting tissue at a time course at 12
and 60 hours after inoculation for later
[SPEAKER_03]: RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to sample destructively,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to be harvesting tissue from
a tomato, waiting a couple days,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then pulling it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to change expression that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything was done in duplicates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could do one plot once and one plot
at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all the plants were assessed for
disease at 144 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when they were really sporulating
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was noticeable and reasonable to
assess.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a layout of one of my field
trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the three blocks, the
randomized treatments over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, there was two of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were done away apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were planted independently.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were inoculated independently with
the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really two different experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lab trials, of which I had three,
were set up in a very similar way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I inoculated detached leaflets in moist
chambers, again, with the sprayer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the same treatments.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, again, done in duplicates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I opened a plate, harvested it,
and I didn't have to open that plate again
[SPEAKER_03]: because the changes in humidity can change
things again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like the field plants,
they were assessed at 144 hours after
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculation for disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did I see?
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the field trials, at 76 hours,
since two hours after inoculation,
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually went out and pulled the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I dug them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put them in big, clay plastic trash
bags with wet paper towels to keep them
[SPEAKER_03]: humid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have loved to have left the plants
in the field and let them sporulate
[SPEAKER_03]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a working farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was early in the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to be this huge source
of inoculum for everybody doing trials
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I myself had a vested interest in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After the first run, I had my second
experiment to be done the next week right
[SPEAKER_03]: next door.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if these sporulated in the field,
I was going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bagged them and brought them into the
lab where they were kept at room
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature until 144 hours where they
were assessed to just let them sporulate
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I took cuttings from the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were quite large plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took terrible pictures this whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just sort of lopped the top off to
take these pictures for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here we have a plant that was
inoculated with inoculum from Newark
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley that was grown up on plates and a
plant that was inoculated with Newark
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley that was grown up on leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we turn these lights off?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the slightest idea how to do
it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can see much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So inoculated from plates or inoculated
from leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just a sample of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can't see it with great detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the disease in the Newark Valley plate
is significantly less than on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was rated around 20%, whereas this
was much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: The differences are even more exaggerated,
though, when we look at the older isolate,
[SPEAKER_03]: 140112.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this plant was inoculated with inoculum
from the plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can almost not see the disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a spleen lesion here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few little lesions within
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as compared to its leaflet-derived
cousin, I mean, the disease on this is
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants were really, really heavily
diseased.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lab trials were assessed very much the
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assessed them at 144 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, actually, the pictures you guys
are about to see are photos taken at 168
[SPEAKER_03]: hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first run of photos I took were
actually the first two runs were just like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The top of the moisture chamber was on top
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized actually, luckily,
after the second lab trial, when I looked
[SPEAKER_03]: at them on my computer, you couldn't see
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it when I did the assessments
because I opened them up and the pictures
[SPEAKER_03]: were no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I quickly noticed that I had a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, I saved all the plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the next day, I just opened them up
and took much better pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the disease was just a little bit
harder than I thought it would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the same order, we've got our Newark
Valley plate-derived and Newark Valley
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf-derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see the Newark Valley
plate-derived are quite a bit healthier
[SPEAKER_03]: than the Newark Valley leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can't see because the
resolution's not so great.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we zoom in, the Newark Valley
plate-derived has quite a bit of healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tissue is still rigid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And though it is sporulating, it's still
quite intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the leaf-lid-derived is completely
water soaked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You couldn't pick these leaves up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just disintegrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's absolutely covered in
sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so if you can see, this tissue is
just completely covered in sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just this kind of healthy tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the difference is, again, even more
magnified when we look at the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate, 140112.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, if you'll notice,
the overall disease is a bit magnified in
[SPEAKER_03]: these lab experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: These moist chambers are your ideal
condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the difference is going to get a bit
exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we zoom in again on the 140112
isolates, the plate-derived inoculum,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's essentially healthy tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this plate, there was one discrete
lesion that you can barely make out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: projector here, right there, as compared
to the leaf-lid-derived at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's completely water soaked,
completely covered in sporulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a really, really notable
difference in disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if I just accumulate the averages
across my trials of these disease ratings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the field trials, obviously,
we had no disease in the water controls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at within the Newark
Valley, the leaf-lid-derived inoculum was,
[SPEAKER_03]: on average, 40% and 30% respectively for
the two trials, as compared to 15% and 10%
[SPEAKER_03]: for this plate-derived version.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same pattern held true with
140112, the older isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaf-derived inoculum was in the 50s
for disease, and the plate-derived
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculum was down in single digits as far
as the synthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really notable difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're wondering about these
averages, about how consistent it was
[SPEAKER_03]: across the reps, these are all the
assessments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see this is within trial two.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the numbers are quite the same
all across.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, really consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lab trials was exactly the same way,
although a bit more exaggerated because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the nature of these lab inoculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water controls were clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Newark Valley leaf resulted in about
80% disease at 144 hours as compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: its plate-derived inoculum, which only
resulted in about 30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, more exaggerated with the
112, the leaf-lid-derived was around 90%
[SPEAKER_03]: disease as compared to single digits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a really significant difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these assessments and
inoculations, I purposely, I did them
[SPEAKER_03]: blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a number system that was just
randomized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what I was spraying and
what.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what I was assessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I have a big notebook page all
filled with these numbers that I wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: down directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after I collected all the data,
I went through with highlighters,
[SPEAKER_03]: color-coded, and set it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just this pattern showed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure Bill has an email somewhere
in his inbox of me just being ecstatic at
[SPEAKER_03]: two in the morning with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just fallen together so beautifully.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after I had these very promising
results from the phenotypic analysis,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to move on to the gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually looking what was behind
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've discussed the tissue collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sampled in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: It immediately froze everything at all the
time points.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was brought back to the lab for
total RNA extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the infected tissue, I had tomato
host gene expression with the phytophagin
[SPEAKER_03]: expression mixed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from those, I prepared my libraries
for RNA sequencing to do the RNA
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also did some real time to just
try to get a handle on what was going on
[SPEAKER_03]: in these samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for an overview of all the samples that
I collected and of all the samples that I
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared for sequencing, this is the first
field trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the three blocks, two time
points, and the treatments within them,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 112 PNL being 112 plate-derived and
112 leaflet-derived, and the second three
[SPEAKER_03]: were valley, plate and leaflet-derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were two field trials with three
blocks each, although I lost one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: blocks to disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really close to a joining field
that had disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really see disease in it,
but I culled it just to be on the safe
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want to have any chance of
unexpected contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my three lab trials, which were all
done independently in the same setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then these samples have become really
important as the experiment has moved on.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just the inoculum, so just
sporangia collected from one for a 112
[SPEAKER_03]: plate, one for a 112 leaflet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same for the Newark valley and
plate and leaflet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not infected anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not been spread anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the concentrated sporangia
collected from these different inoculum
[SPEAKER_03]: sources that I was working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the RNA was there for RNA
sequencing for the real time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have so many samples,
these CDNA libraries became a really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really nontrivial task.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of all the RNA that you extract from a
sample, quite a bit of it, the majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: it is going to be ribosomal RNA,
which I'm not interested in for my
[SPEAKER_03]: differential expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so of that fraction of that that's
going to be useful, messenger RNA,
[SPEAKER_03]: only a small fraction of that in my tissue
samples is going to be phytophthora RNA,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The vast majority, by weight, is going to
be tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really getting good CDNA libraries
was important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the solutions that I ended up using,
I actually just think is really
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting, so I'll tell you about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it exploited the fact that messenger
RNA has a polyethylene tail, and so you
[SPEAKER_03]: can use ferrite beads that have a probe
that associates with that tail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once your mRNA is associated with
these beads, you can just apply a magnet
[SPEAKER_03]: and wash everything else away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all you're left with is your mRNA
that you're interested in working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very efficiently getting rid of all
that ribosomal RNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gave me the best chance of actually
getting my small fraction that is
[SPEAKER_03]: phytophthora RNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's all nice and bound up,
so you can chop it up and start as a
[SPEAKER_03]: phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just small fragments, usable for
sequencing and producing double-stranded
[SPEAKER_03]: libraries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then associate barcodes, because I did
a fair amount of multiplexing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little over 100 samples,
so multiplexing became really important
[SPEAKER_03]: for me to be able to run more than one
sample in a lane so I could actually look
[SPEAKER_03]: at all of my samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now unfortunately, because of some holdups
with the sequencing, my RNA libraries are
[SPEAKER_03]: currently waiting to be processed at Weill
Cornell down in New York City.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't been able to do my RNA
sequencing analysis for you guys yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I certainly couldn't wait that long to
be able to look into what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I set out to do a whole bunch of
real-time PCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to get some sort of an
insight into what was going on with my
[SPEAKER_03]: samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made RNA from the total RNA extracted
from my field samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no ribosomal clues or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just all the RNA that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was made in the cDNA so I could do
real-time on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For tomato, I looked at a handful of
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an elongation factor, mostly as a
normalizer as a reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a housekeeping gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good way to normalize my read back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had CHI3 and STH2.
[SPEAKER_03]: CHI3 is just a chitinase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And STH2 is a pathogenesis-related gene in
tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not expecting them to have a direct
relationship to the phytophthora
[SPEAKER_03]: infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they can give an overview of how the
plant is responding to an infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted a little window into how the
tomato was behaving.
[SPEAKER_03]: For phytophthora infestans, I normalized
everything back to ITS, which is just a
[SPEAKER_03]: transcribed spacer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good normalizer because it's not
really differentially regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at an ATP-binding gene,
a period of RXLR that we've looked at a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really upregulated effector at
early stages of disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And INF1, which is an elicitin,
which is adversely really upregulated at
[SPEAKER_03]: late levels of disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping it would give me a good
insight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just an example of one of the
real-time runs that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on 60-hour leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had been inoculated with 140112 from
the plate, leaflet, and the water control.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a lab experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a really big difference
between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we look at the tomato genes,
there's really no difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tomatoes aren't acting differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: At 60 hours, when the plant was harvested,
we have to remember that we're more than
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 hours away from my assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're quite a ways off from actual
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tissue is green and healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really look like it's diseased.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't actually super surprised by this,
that they're not really acting
[SPEAKER_03]: differently, especially the plague-derived
one, because that one, 544 hours,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was barely diseased anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we looked at the phytophthora
expression, though, at first glance,
[SPEAKER_03]: it looks like there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are differences in
expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that this can actually be
explained in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while the tomatoes were
indistinguishable, the phytophthora and
[SPEAKER_03]: pheasants expression is just relative to
its stage in its disease progress,
[SPEAKER_03]: not to its time point, but how it's
progressing in disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that, I mean, if I aligned the
overall disease that I ended up with with
[SPEAKER_03]: this exact sample at 144 hours,
the leaflet-derived one, we ended up at
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: As compared to only 1% with the
plague-derived one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are very different stages of
their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to exaggerate that problem,
with the RNA extraction and with the
[SPEAKER_03]: real-time PCR, there's a detection
threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has to be at least a certain amount
of material that we would be able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the small fraction of the RNA that
phytophthora is going to be, it may very
[SPEAKER_03]: well be that at this stage of disease,
there's just not enough phytophthora in
[SPEAKER_03]: the lower disease for me to really be able
to see much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to put that more graphically,
our leaflet-derived plant at 60 hours was
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty close to disease 60 hours after the
sampling time that was correlated to the
[SPEAKER_03]: epidemic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the plant inoculated from plates,
60 hours afterwards was still green
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy plant at 144 hours, it only had 1%
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I let these plates go, and actually
in most of the experiments I did,
[SPEAKER_03]: I let them just keep running, the 90%
disease ones, they didn't get any worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't get any worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by a week later, the plates that had
only 1% disease, 5% disease at 144 hours
[SPEAKER_03]: had caught up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The disease had spread and they were now
terribly infected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've just got this little window into
the overall disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just seeing expression relative to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while it was maybe a little bit
discouraging, at least for the real-time
[SPEAKER_03]: PCR, and I had to wait to really get some
insight into this until I could do my RNA
[SPEAKER_03]: sequencing, what it did do is redirect my
focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had these sporangial isolates of just
the sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really felt that if I was going to
have any chance of seeing actual
[SPEAKER_03]: differential expression, different things
going on, it was going to be in those
[SPEAKER_03]: sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as we discussed with our epidemic
acid experiment, these sporangia are
[SPEAKER_03]: different somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They behave differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just an older experiment from
our lab back in 1999.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't looking at inoculum sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was looking at sporangial survival in
the face of solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how well they survived in the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the experiment was done with
sporangia that came from pure culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: the results were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't survive very well and it
wasn't very reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Eduardo, who was doing the study,
noticed if he was using leaflet-derived
[SPEAKER_03]: sporangia, they survived much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got really reliable results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so without even looking into it,
he had really noticed that these
[SPEAKER_03]: sporangia, just on their own, were
behaving quite differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow, they're surviving differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're expressing things differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I refocused on the sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did some more real-time PCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I checked those genes that I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are just the expression levels
normalized to the ITS, which I was talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ATP binding cassette is really,
if I talk clearly, it's really reflective
[SPEAKER_03]: of just cellular activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the photography is really up and doing
things and really going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see more expression in the lens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the expression was not different
between the two of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sporangia are expressing it at the
same levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're waiting for effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I look at my RxLR, my effector,
we saw a fair difference in expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaflet-derived sporangia had twofold
expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're expressing it twice as much as the
plate-derived sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I investigated INF1,
that elicitin that's associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: late-stage disease, the difference was
just astronomical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we look at ratios here, the
plate-derived sporangia are expressing
[SPEAKER_03]: this elicitin at about 100 times more than
their leaf-derived cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually read this a couple times on
a couple different RNA samples,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I wanted to make sure that that's
what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these ratios hold true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the INF1 is really interesting in
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So INF1 is, like, the primary secretive
element in phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's talked about quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's associated with late-stage disease,
inducing hypersensitive response.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not known to be the cause of
resistance to phytophthora infestans in
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes or potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is likely the reason behind some
non-host resistance in some tobaccos and
[SPEAKER_03]: some other plants like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just induces this HR.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in phytophthora infestans,
what it is associated with, is really high
[SPEAKER_03]: expression on that late stages of
infection when the tissue is in a product,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's prolating heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also associated at really high
levels with culture growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at phytophthora growing in
pure culture, because it's not growing on
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to worry about eliciting
responses.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the pattern is is that it's really
highly expressing itself in culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't totally stop expressing it when
it's infecting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early stages of infection, if you look at
a biotrophic early phytophthora growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still expressing this gene,
but it's at much, much more downgraded
[SPEAKER_03]: levels, levels that were more aligned with
my leaflet types.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was a little concerned because they
did say that in their experiment,
[SPEAKER_03]: this was back in 1996, that they didn't
really see it in sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was worried that maybe it was some sort
of an artifact that I was seeing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made sure that when I collected my
sporangia for RNA extraction, I did it
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly like they did in their paper,
and I washed it from the plates and from
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaves just to make sure that I wasn't
picking up more micellia than they were,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did my RNA extractions from those to
run the real-time PCR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with my real-time PCR, I checked you
with melting curves to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_03]: primers that I had designed for this was
getting exactly what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really, really was.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had to try to come up with some
explanation, it may simply be that in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1996, with the RNA extraction protocols
that we had, and they were using northern
[SPEAKER_03]: blots to associate the genes, it might
have just been slightly below the tactical
[SPEAKER_03]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not seeing tons of transcripts of
this gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just seeing a differential expression
between the two of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the reason this was exciting,
and the reason that, again, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I fired Bill off a frantic email at 2 in
the morning with writing that was hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand because I was so excited,
is because if we look at the overall
[SPEAKER_03]: expression, the leaflet derives sporangia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are XLRs upregulated,
and the INF went downregulated at levels
[SPEAKER_03]: that we associate with early-stage
photophorefection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks very much like when we look at
gene expression in phytophthora infecting,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, being a good biofilm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the plate derives sporangia,
their expression looks an awful lot like
[SPEAKER_03]: late-stage necrotic phytophthora or
phytophthora kind of lazily growing on a
[SPEAKER_03]: plate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not making the argument that the
upregulated elicitin and the downregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: RXLR are resulting in some sort of
resistance or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that in order for the plate
derives sporangia to infect and really
[SPEAKER_03]: start causing this early, biotrophic
disease that phytophthora is so good at,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to really significantly change its
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to downregulate that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to upregulate the effectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the leaflet derives sporangia are
already expressing just like we would
[SPEAKER_03]: expect in an early-stage disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started building the hypothesis that
the gene expression in these tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: derives sporangia, the sporangia we watch
from leaflets, is already at what it needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a good early pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already set and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as it is applied, it can start
growing, in about 144 hours we have this
[SPEAKER_03]: overall early disease, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're 100% with the lab experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the culture derives sporangia,
they're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just need to take some time to change
the regulation before they can really
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively infect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may result in that shift in the
disease that I had with those arrows that
[SPEAKER_03]: skews the window that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may just set them back a week or so,
which is actually sort of like what we saw
[SPEAKER_03]: in the lab, the plate experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in summary, for the phenotypic
analysis, the leaflet-derived inoculum
[SPEAKER_03]: caused a significant amount more disease
than the plate-derived inoculum of the
[SPEAKER_03]: same linkage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this held true across all of the
trials and field-type experiments and
[SPEAKER_03]: lab-type experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it held true for both isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's notable, and it was pretty apparent
that there was a difference between the
[SPEAKER_03]: two isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, again, was the same through all
the different trials that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may have something to do with the
time of culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: 1,4-O-1-2 had been growing in culture for
a year before I used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the New York Valley was right off
of being a pathogen after a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't make too many conclusions
about what time of culture might induce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would need an awful lot more isolates to
look at to really make some firm
[SPEAKER_03]: statements on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might be exciting for you to do
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I couldn't make those assessments with
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real-time PCR basically told me that
with the methods that I have right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least with the real-time PCR,
I can't see much difference in my tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to wait for the RNA
sequencing to see if I can see anything
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even then, it may be the fact that in
my tissue samples and my time core
[SPEAKER_03]: samples, I'm just seeing the difference in
disease stage between the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it really focused is that the
sporangial RNA sequencing and the
[SPEAKER_03]: sporangial real-time is what's really
going to be the crux of the difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between these two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for the RNA-seq, as I said a minute
ago, I'm still very keen to look at my
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue samples over the time course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really interested in what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they may just reflect the disease
progression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the sporangial gene expression is
really going to be how I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: focusing on the time board and forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look like they're really quite
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited to see how they're
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank everybody in my lab,
all the current members, certainly in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past members who have left Giovanna and
Richard, all of the graduate students,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially the members of the Perry lab
who have been bothering incessantly for
[SPEAKER_03]: help with the RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly the folks at the farm in
Freeville, the Thompson Research Farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve McKay and the staff there,
I've done quite a few field trials with
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've put in an awful lot of work
for us and the folks down at the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse and everybody who's helping
with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using 5,000 sporangians per
mill, that's 50 per square centimeter or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, I guess the question is,
do you see, if you look at the microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see different behaviors of the
sporangia in initial germination and
[SPEAKER_03]: infection?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't assessed them
microscopically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't looked at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be difficult to see them on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be a really interesting thing to
look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have done germination experiments
with other islets.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done it between clone lineage a
couple of times to see how quickly they
[SPEAKER_03]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might be a really good thing to
do before, even if it was just done
[SPEAKER_03]: culture or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't looked at it and said,
no, I'm not sure what they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately on their new tissue like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But presumably only a fraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly not all of them germinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the inoculum that I'm spraying,
because I let them germinate in the fridge
[SPEAKER_03]: for a while, it's actually more of a mixed
suspension of sporangia and zoospores.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's quite a bit of zoospores coming
right from the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the zoospores are applied directly to
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they very quickly find the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was looking at that, which
actually quite a bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would expect that only a
fraction of them survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not really sure what the spores
for the ones that I don't see disease for
[SPEAKER_03]: quite an extent of time are doing in that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the difficulty in taking
the sporangia from pure culture and going
[SPEAKER_02]: into plants is related to the same
phenomenon there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it certainly could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a couple of things contributing
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The simple is that some of them are
actually just a mechanical problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the problems is if you were to
transfer an auger cube of a culture of
[SPEAKER_03]: phytophthora onto a leaflet, it has a
tendency to just really grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fluffs up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a cotton ball of phytophthora in
the auger cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: It preferentially is growing on the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't want to go into the leaflets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to grow into a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we mix sporangial suspensions,
it annihilates that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it certainly may have to do quite a
bit with this delaying infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to detach the leaflet in
the moist chamber, and it's sitting at 18
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees down in our cold room in that
moist chamber, just the leaf, and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no disease by six days or by a little over
a week, then you start running into
[SPEAKER_03]: problems with the cells start apoptosing
from the watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sit in this water auger and the cells
start to explode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they can get bacterially contaminated
or just start to degrade from not being on
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant for that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the challenges, with that,
is just that the tissue gets crowded
[SPEAKER_03]: before we can isolate anything good from
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose if we tried to wake up our
cultures by spraying them onto field
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, maybe it would be a bit more
reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I rely on if they got disease off
of my culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just took a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't really have that luxury when
we're trying to just wake it up and allow
[SPEAKER_03]: it to experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it certainly could contribute,
and maybe it could be part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would certainly explain why it's such a
pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you've got a question?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sean, one issue, two questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phenomena you're describing were first
presented in some of the quantitative PCR
[SPEAKER_02]: data where you saw different levels of
disease, and you saw perhaps an order of
[SPEAKER_02]: magnitude difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were suggesting that that was perhaps
an artifact of just not having much
[SPEAKER_02]: disease or pathogen in the acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But was the issue there that you were at
the threshold of detection?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I'm wondering is because
you see they have an internal control that
[SPEAKER_02]: you were normalizing into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And presumably, the same question is going
to come up a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your large guess is it's a data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the threshold of detection I was
talking about, I think, is more to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was to look at a bigger variety of
genes, some of those lower expressed genes
[SPEAKER_03]: that may be more intricately involved,
I don't think I would be able to see them
[SPEAKER_03]: at that level of disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the phenomenon that I saw
there, you're right, it was normalized
[SPEAKER_03]: after ITS.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was normalized to the amount of
material that was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not a detection problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just truly representative of the
amount of material that I had there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was normalized to a phytopater
gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just more of an overall point of
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had normalized it to a tomato gene,
for instance, it would have gotten some
[SPEAKER_03]: wild things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was internally controlled for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those genes were being expressed at the
same level to samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quantity that I saw of the difference
was just how much was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get to your large-scale
sequence again, presumably you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: run into the same issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I certainly might.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to spend a lot of time
working on trying to tweeze out absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finding normalizers is going to be really
important for the RNA sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should also be more sensitive than this
real-time was too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, in the limited time that I
had, I didn't get to spend as much time
[SPEAKER_03]: optimizing the real-time as I would have
liked to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a lot of work to go with the
real-time, actually, to be able to really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really rely on it heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just been a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if I can see it very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: John?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said that your tissue samples,
you believe, are reflective of a delay in
[SPEAKER_00]: disease progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at them, inspect them
again later, and you find that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: reached the same level of disease,
do you think that the plate-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum disease is due to the primary
inoculum, or is this now secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum that has grown on those things?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in field plants, if I had let the field
plants grow much, much longer,
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect that there may have been some
problems with secondary inoculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the lab experiments, there's no air
movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sporangi aren't really going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they grew out, they just progressed
from just sort of a rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that there's any secondary
inoculation over the short time that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: With these isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, so the lab experiment where I
had 1% and not even 44 hours, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: barely any inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to be enough to somehow
go out and infect them, and then a week
[SPEAKER_03]: later cause a much heavier model of
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think that secondary infection
played much of a role in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it was truly just sort of a
delay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't get gone very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you had a second part of the
question, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's a nutrient difference
between sporangi grown on leaves compared
[SPEAKER_03]: to sporangi grown on plates?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like they've been provided with
different amounts of nutrients for their
[SPEAKER_03]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that different nutrients is
lost when they're made with plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the agar that we grow on,
potato agar, rye agar, I use the rye and
[SPEAKER_03]: pea agar mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not tomato leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there certainly could be a
difference in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could have some effect on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't looked into the available
nutrients for these though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we thank Sean again,
I'd like to ask one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take to prepare 100
samples from leaf tissue to centivore?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do eight at a time with the kit that
I was using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that protocol from straight RNA to a
finished DNA library takes about five and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so 100 samples across five and a half
hours, doing it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take to get the RNA?
[SPEAKER_03]: About three hours, three and a half hours
from sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, why didn't you look at it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of checking and rechecking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Sean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
