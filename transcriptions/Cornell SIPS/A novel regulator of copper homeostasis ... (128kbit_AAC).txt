Good
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about my PhD
project, which is a normal regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: common human-based genome-wide
transcriptomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, Congress evolved in multiple
metabolic patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: for so many years, but we
still...
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this regulation achieves
[SPEAKER_00]: a normal function in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the function
of...
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see in this photo...
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to further investigate...
[SPEAKER_00]: As Olina mentioned, I was so worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many numbers in the
HM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize the results,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you remember, I mentioned...
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you found the code.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to see what's
the...
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a fresh
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has been known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do so, we use a deep
sequencing-based genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then among those...
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize the
[SPEAKER_00]: result...
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this one, hybrid indicates
A-rept-free A-KH... And the TDA insertion
[SPEAKER_00]: was used,
[SPEAKER_00]: even under normal copper condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
