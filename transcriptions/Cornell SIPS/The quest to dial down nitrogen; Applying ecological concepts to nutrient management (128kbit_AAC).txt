[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to talk about the quest to
dial down nitrogen today, and I bet some
[SPEAKER_00]: of you were wondering where I got that
title from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me that they were surprised
to see the title from someone serious like
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm not going to tell you who said
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share with you some
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find anything on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an advertising slogan generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the URL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I had choices, and it was hard,
but I ultimately settled on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: because I could relate it to my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this one, but I couldn't think of
how to relate it to my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if any of you could think of how to
relate this to what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: today, let me know afterwards.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, today I'm going to talk about some of
the recent projects that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on in my lab, and I want to thank
you all for coming, and I really
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate this opportunity to
share this with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to first start by talking about
the context of the work we do in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to spend about a third of the
talk on that because there are some new
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries that are really useful to
apply to the problems that we work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to spend time talking about
that before I go into three different
[SPEAKER_00]: projects which I'll touch on briefly,
beginning with some mass balance work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll talk about some of our work
on nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing quite a lot of work on
nitrogen fixation in many different
[SPEAKER_00]: settings for the past few years,
and then I'll tackle the monster project
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the collaboration with social
scientists and biophysical scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: about linkages across the social
ecological interface.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the one thing that's notable about the
problem of nitrogen loss from agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: is its persistence, and also the global
extent of the consequences of this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, about half the nitrogen fertilizer is
lost from agricultural systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this really varies depending on the
type of system that you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it accounts for about three quarters
of the anthropogenic nitrogen that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: added to the global nitrogen cycle,
and there's a number of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences ranging from increased
greenhouse gas emissions and climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change to changes in ecosystem species
composition and function due to things
[SPEAKER_00]: like nitrogen deposition, and then also
eutrophication or pollution of fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and also nearshore marine
environments, so that now we've got about
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 hypoxic zones, and actually the number
is increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, before I go into some of the work
we're doing, I want to just review the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen cycle really briefly for those of
you that don't live immersed in nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in an unmanaged ecosystem,
the internal cycling dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most new end is coming in from nitrogen
fixation, and then there are multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels weird to use a laser being this
close, but I need a stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple, I like this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple loss pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are usually small, but they can
vary, and actually understanding variation
[SPEAKER_00]: in these losses across ecosystems has been
the focus of a lot of forest and other
[SPEAKER_00]: ecologists working on ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we have a different situation in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this huge offtake through
harvest, so to compensate, we add nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, which increases our inorganic
nitrogen pools, especially nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then pushes these loss pathways,
particularly denitrification and leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: in North America, and to some extent,
ammonia volatilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do we deal with this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's notable about the approach
that we've used is that we're focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly on this single pathway here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, nitrogen fertilizer goes into the soil
in this plant-available form, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy is to increase the efficiency or
delivery to the crop, and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of technologies that are all
geared towards increasing this efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of guiding strategy is the four
Rs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find this all over the internet
with how to improve your nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: management, focused on using the right
product at the right rate and time and
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, delivering it to the crop roots when
it's needed, and this strategy has been
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cases where the efficiency
of fertilizer use has been more than
[SPEAKER_00]: double by sideways addressing,
for example, five times during the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season is one thing that's been effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the approach that we've used in my lab
to address the problem of nitrogen is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of complementary to this, where we've
focused on a number of processes at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's two areas of ecological
research that are the basis for most of
[SPEAKER_00]: our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first comes from ecosystem ecology,
and this is called the nitrogen saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen saturation is defined as when the
nitrogen influx exceeds the capacity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecosystem to assimilate nitrogen
through either plant or microbial uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: or to store nitrogen, basically in soil
organic matter reservoirs for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, in ways that could be accessed by
plants or microbes later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, once you get beyond this point,
then you are at saturation, and I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about the symptoms in a minute,
but this framework is able to predict the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem response in pollution,
or atmospheric deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, that was one of the main
reasons why this framework was developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by a group of ecologists working in
forested ecosystems in the northeastern U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they were trying to explain
differences in nitrogen loss and retention
[SPEAKER_00]: that they saw in these natural ecosystems,
which were all, in theory, undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had very high biodiversity,
no tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why were they losing so much
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has had a huge impact on ecology,
and I think also it has potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: really inform agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a framework for understanding
how nitrogen cycling is connected to other
[SPEAKER_00]: elemental cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, this connection between
nitrogen and carbon is highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's the symptoms of nitrogen
saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, beginning from increased
rates of nitrification through to the
[SPEAKER_00]: losses, and also the form of nitrogen
that's lost and increased nitrous oxide
[SPEAKER_00]: fluxes from denitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all are basically what we see in
agricultural systems, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: managing them as a nitrogen saturated
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the challenges in
trying to reduce nitrogen losses by solely
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on nitrogen alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, losses are a symptom of nitrogen
saturation, whether you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, these are three forests in
North America compared to temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: forests, so a similar kind of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are forests in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen deposition from human activities
is very high in North America,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we see very high losses that
consist mostly of nitrate in these
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a similar thing in agricultural
systems with this relationship between the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen input explaining about half the
variation in unrecovered nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a second area of ecological knowledge
or research that is the basis for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our work is, this comes from rhizosphere
ecology, and Brian talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about this a couple weeks ago at the RAD
Review, and the recognition for the role
[SPEAKER_00]: of plant microbial collaborations in
driving decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one implication of this is the
realization that this very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: limited habitat, the rhizosphere,
which is minute compared to bulk soil in
[SPEAKER_00]: some ecosystems, actually dominates
nutrient cycling in some ecosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so much activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect of this that's had a big
impact is just recognizing that here's
[SPEAKER_00]: another adaptive strategy that plants can
use for nutrient acquisition, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: could be something that we could
intentionally manage in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is shaking this view of
decomposition as solely a microbially
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you can still put soil in a jar,
and you'll still get decomposition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is useful for asking certain
questions, but we have to realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not reflective at all of the
decomposition that could be occurring out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field or in an intact ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, this collaboration between plants
and microbes where the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: providing labile carbon to the primary
decomposers, so bacteria and fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing them to break down the more
recalcitrant organic matter pools,
[SPEAKER_00]: take up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The release of the nutrients actually
requires other participants from the food
[SPEAKER_00]: web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when grazers like protozoans feed on
these primary decomposers, there's a net
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of carbon and a release of inorganic
nitrogen and phosphorus that can be taken
[SPEAKER_00]: up by plants, and the predators also can
play a role if you've got that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity in your food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all happens in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tightly coupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process can increase decomposition
compared to bulk soil by two to tenfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's some of the numbers that are
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that this mechanism actually
then can explain this observation that
[SPEAKER_00]: here's three of our very important crops,
corn and small grains, and the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nitrogen that these crops take up
comes from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, less than 40%, despite having plenty
of fertilizer, less than 40% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in these crops in 217 studies
came from the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that sort of shows us the challenge
that we're up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if we take this information together,
we can see that this problem of leakiness
[SPEAKER_00]: in agriculture is really systemic,
and it begins with this use of inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, which is the most difficult form
of nitrogen to actually control in the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and to keep in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exacerbated by the fact that
plants are going to take up nitrogen from
[SPEAKER_00]: soil organic matter because they've
evolved, along with microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to access those pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when this is coupled with some of
the structural changes in rotations that
[SPEAKER_00]: have increased fallows and have reduced
inputs of carbon into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: or accelerated decomposition through
tillage, we end up with a soil that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: even less organic matter, so that we've
got microbes that are in the soil and they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically are still starved for carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not interested in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the potential to absorb nitrogen is
reduced in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's kind of multiple levels where
we have this problem of limited carbon,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we end up with lost pathways,
such as denitrification and nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching predominating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we use a typology to describe the
different strategies for approaching this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem of nitrogen leakiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from an ecological perspective,
we can identify three distinct strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one is end of pipe, and we don't
really work on that very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we just say, well, we know that we're
going to lose nitrogen, so let's intercept
[SPEAKER_00]: it before it gets to the places where we
don't want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is something that's getting a lot
of attention, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi River Basin, where about 30
years of work at the field scale has still
[SPEAKER_00]: not resulted in significant reductions in
nitrate in the waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're really focused on the natural
resources surrounding these lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a second is fertilizer-based or the
single process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I already talked about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the dominant approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a third, we call ecological or
sea-encoupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these approaches manage multiple
processes and are focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-ecosystem-scale nitrogen retention as
part of the process with the strategy of
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the nitrogen surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we know the surplus from nitrogen
saturation theory, we know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: surplus is a big driver of losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one way to reduce losses is to be able
to somehow reduce the surplus nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're adding to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm going to start by talking about
some of our work with field-scale nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: mass balances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our question here is basically,
how does management impact field-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient flows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, our hypothesis was that
these methods that involve increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-nitrogen coupling or that are
targeting or impacting multiple processes
[SPEAKER_00]: that affect nitrogen retention are going
to show reduced surpluses and reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about two pieces of
work from my former graduate student,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jennifer Blesch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first did a meta-analysis of the N15
literature in order to ask this question,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are we finding in the experimental
plots in terms of nitrogen recovery?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to the Mississippi River
Basin to those grain systems because a
[SPEAKER_00]: great deal of this research that's been
done on nitrogen using N15 has been done
[SPEAKER_00]: with grain systems, particularly in
temperate systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these are some of the results from the
meta-analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for those of you not used to looking
at these, so if there's no effect of a
[SPEAKER_00]: management practice, and the management
practices are listed here, so I'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrification inhibitor as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no effect, then we'd see the
average change here at zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, we have it at nearly 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this means that compared to the
standard practice, which is broadcast
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer in most cases, using a
nitrification inhibitor increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fertilizer recovery by nearly 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we can see we've got them
arranged in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the two practices that focus on
fertilizer, proximity to the roots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: timing, fall versus spring, had the
greatest impact, so increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery by 24 and 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compared to these, we had two sort of
ecologically-based or C-N coupling-based
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is a more complex crop rotation
that reduces bare fallows, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: source of nitrogen could be manure,
compost, or legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most were legumes and manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of these practices increased
recovery by about 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we wondered, well, what will we see if
we go out to farmers' fields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we see this kind of a range in the
recovery or loss reduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can't manage, you can't measure
losses out in working fields very well,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you've got, you know, sort of a
multi-billion dollar budget to put all the
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments out in the field and a bunch
of farmers who you can then pay for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the inconvenience of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, instead of trying to measure losses,
we constructed budgets for these fields,
[SPEAKER_00]: simple nutrient and nitrogen mass balance
budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, we looked for,
we found four regions in the Mississippi
[SPEAKER_00]: River Basin where we could actually find a
diverse range of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not easy to find in that part
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we were able to find systems that
ranged from the dominant corn-soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: rotations to those that, some that
incorporated winter grains or had some
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in their rotations, to others
that included perennials, forages,
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, and then some, we also found
organic production systems that don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: any fertilizer nitrogen at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was our continuum in these four
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We identified 110 farms and used two
fields in each of those to construct a
[SPEAKER_00]: budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a simple input-output budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the inputs were fertilizer,
biological nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the output that we measured was
the nitrogen harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we constructed the budget just as
exports subtracted from inputs to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that surplus will drive
losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the greater the surplus, all other
things being equal, the more vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: the system is for nitrogen loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we find deficits, then there's a danger
of mining the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that these mass balances
agreed very well with what we found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: meta-analysis from the research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the legging base, if you look at the
nitrogen sources, the legging base has had
[SPEAKER_00]: the smallest surplus, meaning that they
have the least, they're least vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: to nitrogen losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an interesting difference
between spring applied versus fall applied
[SPEAKER_00]: manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, systems that put manure on at
different times, if they put on the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to really be over-applying
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fertilizer-based method sort
of fell out in the middle here with
[SPEAKER_00]: surpluses that range from about 35 to 38
kilograms per hectare per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at rotations, so this is
just summer annuals, just corn-soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, we had only 29 fields that
actually incorporated a winter annual
[SPEAKER_00]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had almost 70 that had
perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually perennials often means that
they also have legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we cannot tease apart the effect of
rotation or perennials from the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the challenges of doing
on-farm stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see that, you know, we feel good
because this agrees with the meta-analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and also with the predictions of nitrogen
saturation theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pointing out the, these are the
surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the input.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, yeah, this is the addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the export, and that's the
surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the danger of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other interesting relationship that we
see in this data set is that as you
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the proportion of nitrogen that's
derived from biological nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also reduce the surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have some here that are showing
a small deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only saw this relationship if the
nitrogen rate, the annual additions were
[SPEAKER_00]: over, were 81 kilograms per hectare or
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen this in some of the
regional farms, and I'll show you some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is an intriguing result because
it suggests that, you know, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: inherent efficiency of increasing the
proportion of nitrogen fixation that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we think that these results show that
there's multiple benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do we reduce nitrogen losses,
which is what you get if you improve
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer use efficiency, which is a very
important outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also will see reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions because nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation is a solar-powered technology,
and I think it's one of the underused
[SPEAKER_00]: solar-powered technologies that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got a great one in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we also end up building organic matter
reserves, which will enable plants to rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on this mechanism that they've developed
over through evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got a system of breaking down
organic matter and accessing those pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very tight, tightly-coupled
system, and it's quite resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen losses since it's occurring in
the rhizosphere, very small spatial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other benefits such as some
drought resistance that can accrue as you
[SPEAKER_00]: build organic matter pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to move on to talk about
nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, I'm going to focus on
some of our on-farm work that Megan
[SPEAKER_00]: Japansky did when she was here doing her
doctoral research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started out with, originally,
when farmers were asking lots of questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about nitrogen fixation and how much
nitrogen they thought they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting from these green manures,
we went to the literature because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing research on nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there was just very
little information, particularly on the
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of legumes that were being used as
green manure crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot on soybeans, not too much in
farmers' fields, and a fair amount on
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for many of the species that farmers
are using in the Northeast, there was just
[SPEAKER_00]: very little data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we started by looking at nitrogen
fixation in organic grain and vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and also some conventional
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, nitrogen fixation really should be the
primary source of nitrogen for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming because Haber-Bosch nitrogen is
forbidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When farms use compost from conventional
agriculture, they're actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, subsidized through synthetic
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, you know, it's allowed because
they are recycling a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reliance on nitrogen fixation is
even worse in organic vegetable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have this huge range just in
organic systems in terms of how well
[SPEAKER_00]: they're managing and using nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the impact of this on the
balances, we see that it really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter whether you're talking about
Haber-Bosch nitrogen or compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're relying on those kind of inputs
and using very little nitrogen fixation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you tend to have larger surpluses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the organic grain systems that
have much higher proportion of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, these organic vegetable systems are
creating an environmental problem as well
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're using a different
source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are operating, they may, there may be
a delay in the rate of nitrogen loss,
[SPEAKER_00]: but eventually those systems will become
saturated even though they're adding some
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, they tend to have really an
over-application of phosphorus too in
[SPEAKER_00]: these cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we were very interested in looking at
how differences in soil fertility impact
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanted to understand how planting
the legume either as a monoculture or with
[SPEAKER_00]: interseeded grasses impacted nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected that in fields, and this was
done in regional farms in the Finger Lakes
[SPEAKER_00]: with variations in their history of
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected those that had a legacy of
using legumes would have higher soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nitrogen pools and that there may
be some suppression of nitrogen fixation
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you have more nitrogen
available in the soil, then normally the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes down-regulate nitrogen fixation
because it is so energy-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also expected that when the,
and we used red clover in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, that red clover planted with
the wheat, interseeded with the wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: may fix nitrogen at a higher rate,
but it might end up fixing less total
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen because of reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maybe competition from shading,
for example, could end up reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: total amount fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were some of the things that we
thought we would see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we, in this experiment, one central
piece was to look at the frost seeding of
[SPEAKER_00]: red clover into winter grains and evaluate
the performance of that practice because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a very important practice in
organic grain systems and it has many
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits in terms of keeping the soil
covered and reducing tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in order to do this, for those of you
that aren't familiar, you start with wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter and the legume, the red
clover is frosted and frost seeded,
[SPEAKER_00]: germinates in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy closes and it stops growing for
a while until harvest takes place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after harvest, when the grain's
removed, it fills the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a field, a stand of red clover
that can be cut, but it is used as the
[SPEAKER_00]: green manure for nitrogen fertility for
the following corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this research was conducted by
embedding replicated plots into farmers'
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go through all the
methods here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions, ask me later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we did find that as the proportion of
reliance on nitrogen fixation increased,
[SPEAKER_00]: that overall nitrogen fertility increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a number of measurements
beginning with the inorganic pools through
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of the labile pools to the total
organic nitrogen pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one single measurement really
isn't a very good indicator of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: availability in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't see, even though we had a
fair amount of variation, we didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: any suppression of nitrogen fixation in
the clover that corresponded with
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did see some significant impacts of the
way the clover was planted with clover in
[SPEAKER_00]: a monoculture having a lower fixation
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when clover was growing by itself
without a nonlegume as competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was able to take up more nitrogen from
the soil and fix less compared to clover
[SPEAKER_00]: that is interceded with the winter grain
or clover planted with orchard grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this was our other comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the farmer practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was clover planted with a perennial
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we looked at the total
nitrogen fixed, we found that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually highest in the farmer practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the rate of nitrogen fixation
increased, but there was no reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: total biomass production of the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, so the clover in a monoculture
had a great biomass, but not as much
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen from fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clover with the orchard grass had a higher
rate, but a significant suppression in the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall growth or biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up reducing the nitrogen
fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from the perspective, well,
the farmers are doing the right thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of managing clover in these systems
and managing nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we started with brain farms because
they are a lot simpler to do this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have similar crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're located on some similar soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, the organic vegetable systems
where we have a lot of problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: managing nitrogen fixation and farmers,
there's a lot of interest on the part of
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in work that will sort of inform
their management.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the grain farms, we found some
variability in soil nitrogen fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's below the threshold for nitrogen
for BNF suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not the case in vegetable
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that fertility is high enough that
it is suppressing nitrogen fixation in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: A strategy that uses interseeding in a way
that minimizes competition between the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes and the non-legumes is really an
optimal strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the benefits of competition for
soil nitrogen and, you know, reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen availability to up the fixation
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since their growth is staggered,
that gives the clover a chance to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: without competition for light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this on-farm work, and we have some
work we've done in vegetable systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the basis for the next phase of
research in cover crop mixtures that Emily
[SPEAKER_00]: will be carrying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talked a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm on the last project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought three might be pushing
it, but I don't know, two just seemed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three, nice and round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm going to talk a little bit
about the interdisciplinary project that
[SPEAKER_00]: used the Mississippi River Basin and the
problem of hypoxia as sort of a case study
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to understand how the linkages
across the social ecological interface
[SPEAKER_00]: drive agricultural management regimes'
land use and intensification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine, here's the research
team and our institutions and various
[SPEAKER_00]: specialties, that this is a complex
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all complain, those of us that do
this work, that even, we're always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at meetings giving talks in 15
or 20 minutes, which is really hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to just pick a couple of
things to show as examples to maybe pique
[SPEAKER_00]: your interest and get you interested in
doing this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does take time, but it's been a really
valuable experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned a lot from people from the,
you know, the cross disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Mississippi River Basin epitomizes
an intensive industrial system that is
[SPEAKER_00]: high yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the most important food
production systems in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last statistic I have, which might be
have gone down a little bit as production
[SPEAKER_00]: expands out into developing countries was
nearly 80% of the world's feed grains come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Mississippi River Basin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an extensive network of
research and extension and government
[SPEAKER_00]: policies that support this agricultural
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also some very significant
environmental consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main one being that you probably are
familiar with is the dead zone or the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, although there have been some
improvements in fertilizer use efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: in these systems, so far it hasn't
impacted the nitrate levels in streams
[SPEAKER_00]: draining the basement or the hypoxic zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this year's, the size of this
year's zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They track it every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's smaller than predicted and they've
got some ideas about why that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's right just barely above the five
year average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not seeing a, you know,
a trend downward yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some ideas about why there
might be some lags in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two overarching questions of this
project, what are the key social
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological linkages governing the current
agricultural systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how could these linkages be modified
to expand ecosystem services delivered by
[SPEAKER_00]: this agricultural system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk specifically about some
work that was done in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen Wolf and his graduate student
Stephanie Huffenegger-Eichmeyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one way that this is framed is to
look for evidence of adaptive coupling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is defined as an appropriate
response to environmental degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question that was addressed in the
project, are resources targeting the
[SPEAKER_00]: regions that are responsible for the
hypoxia?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk about research
resources and then the policy driven
[SPEAKER_00]: incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we need to look at, well,
where are the nitrogen losses coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ending up in the Gulf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work done with Mark David using
county level nitrogen budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we run that analysis,
we find that, you know, the losses,
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest losses occur here in this
blue zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the color gets lighter,
they get lower and lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these losses are driven by the
intensity of the agriculture, in other
[SPEAKER_00]: words, the proportion of the area that's
in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertilizer rates and the presence of tile
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this turns out to be a real key
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does everybody know what tile drainage is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was invented in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody not know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what it is then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's installing these pipes,
which used to be made out of tile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're made out of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a meter down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depth varies depending on soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're French drains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these heavy soils, which are,
you know, many are former wetland soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: it provides drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water, instead of standing,
percolates down into these drains and then
[SPEAKER_00]: moves out of the field underground into a
bunch of drainage ditches that surround,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a network of ditches that surround
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has a huge impact on productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really what enabled some of
these wetland soils, which are high in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter, to become hugely
productive for these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look at the resources in
terms of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, we analyzed the USDA CRIS
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we analyzed 10 years of data,
looking at projects that related to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stephanie used that typology that I
mentioned earlier, end of pipe,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, and ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, she looked at the amount
going to different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the corn belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Gulf of Mexico states.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the recipients of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a greater amount of research on
nitrogen management is going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem area, recipients, not the people
making the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually one of Stephen
Wolf's predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the temporal trend in
investment, we see a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for the Gulf states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where overall total investment's going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the corn belt states where the overall
investment is going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one database.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the CRIS national database.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have really liked to look at
state budgets for research, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of the problems that we
found, is that there are many things that
[SPEAKER_00]: would help us to understand how well we're
doing in terms of tackling this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the data is simply not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is data more in the
social system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resource allocation, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second sort of resource allocation
question has to do with the incentives
[SPEAKER_00]: that are generated by our
agro-environmental policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the farm bill, which is
slated to change if they ever pass another
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the proposed insurance-based
incentives will actually parallel the
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity sort of yield subsidy-based
incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the farms that qualify for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found, if you can remember the
dark areas contributing to hypoxia,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the payments for crop production
naturally are going predominantly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that have the high yields and are
the most intensified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also the areas that are
contributing to environmental degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at conservation payments,
we see just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where those areas that are really
productive and have the high corn yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and also are the most leaky and
contributing most of the nitrogen to the
[SPEAKER_00]: streams are not interested in conservation
payments, which tend to be less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not nearly as lucrative as the
crop payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of things going on
within the policy world and in NRCS to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to correct this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not, people are aware that if
you have a high yielding crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a high yielding farm,
you've got fertile soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the conservation options that are
going to improve your nitrogen management
[SPEAKER_00]: just are not economically appealing to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that can be addressed
through policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the midst of doing some work
with this database, this county-level
[SPEAKER_00]: database that has all the agricultural
practices, fertilizer use, and all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: By combining it with the soil productivity
index that's been developed by NRCS and
[SPEAKER_00]: data from the Census of Ag, the economic
census, and the, what is it, the new one,
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: American Community Survey, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a new, beyond the census,
we have a new survey that captures
[SPEAKER_00]: socioeconomic data from communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the midst of taking the next
step with this to try to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: the biophysical environment impacts
agricultural structure and whether or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask whether or not there are cascading
effects for rural communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the questions we're looking at here,
how does the biophysical setting influence
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural intensification and the
response of agriculture to policy market
[SPEAKER_00]: signals?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know about the counties that are
actually receiving payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know about their impact on the
environment and the structure of their
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to ask, is it going to the next
level up of the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does soil fertility influence the
socioeconomics of rural communities in
[SPEAKER_00]: intensified landscapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually didn't think there would be
very much of an impact given the high
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of industrialization of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's reliance on technologies and
inputs to produce yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show you a couple of
plots of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing some multivariate
analyses of this data because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really the only way that you can analyze
this sort of a complex data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the initial correlations look
promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, corn yields are higher in the
soils that have the higher productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: potential index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me feel good about the NRCS
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that intensification,
so this is a question about if we compare
[SPEAKER_00]: the corn acreage in this period in the
1960s to corn acreage from 2002 to 2006,
[SPEAKER_00]: how have the changes been on a county
level basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're down here in the negative,
we lost corn acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're up here, we gained corn
acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this, you can see that
intensification is continuing and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing in those counties that are
already the most intensively managed and
[SPEAKER_00]: are also the problems, the problem
counties from an environmental impact
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the policies are continuing to foster
and exacerbate the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation that is currently occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we look at some of the
relationships between productivity and
[SPEAKER_00]: economic outcomes, first looking at the
percent of farms reporting losses,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find an inverse relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proportion of farms that report
losses in high fertility soils is much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower compared to those that are in the
lower fertility soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this relationship, it's even
stronger than the relationship to corn
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, suggesting that the policies that
were using the incentives that reward
[SPEAKER_00]: yields actually exacerbate differences
that are occurring due to the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this last one, is looking at the
impact of soil fertility on the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: families living below the poverty level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, does this difference
in soil fertility and farm structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: the intensity of agriculture, the
incentives that are passed down from the
[SPEAKER_00]: agro-environmental policy, does that
impact the broader community?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that there is a correlation of
R squared of 0.29 with lower rates of
[SPEAKER_00]: poverty related to the high fertility
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is commonly seen in
subsistence agriculture, but I was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised to see, I mean, that's a pretty
strong relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that we're doing with this
database, which we're building,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adding other variables in,
we'll be looking at this relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between soil fertility, access to
amenities, so shopping, grocery stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical facilities, and those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the stereotype has been that
people that live in counties, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a stereotype, based on some
research in California, we expected that
[SPEAKER_00]: counties with the highest productivity and
the greatest intensification would have
[SPEAKER_00]: overall lower or reduced quality of life
based on the amenities available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have a depopulation of the
counties where you've got lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those farm families or all families in
the county?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on census data, so it's all
families in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be people working in agriculture
and everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could just be the most productive
counties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is only rural counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a first course analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at a lot of per capita
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah, because if you leave the
urban counties in, it really confuses
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because urbanization tends to occur where
the more fertile soils are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it really throws a bench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for now we've left those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, so to summarize what we found
so far from this project, and I mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: limited it to some of the results that I
presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at this as a system,
it's evident that maladaptive coupling
[SPEAKER_00]: dominates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, the system is responding
to policies, really at a national level,
[SPEAKER_00]: that keep pushing it on its current
trajectory of intensification and of
[SPEAKER_00]: production or yield as the main focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some counties have actually taken steps to
try to reverse that trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the county level because they realize
that they're losing their communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are incentives such as five
years of no taxes if you convert to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain counties have implemented
programs where they preferentially buy
[SPEAKER_00]: produce from local farms in order to
provide a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're out in the Midwest,
you really are tied to the global market
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is due in part to these commodity
payments that support mainly corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of leap over and completely
overwhelm any local initiatives for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this intensification is particularly
pronounced in the areas that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly responsible for nitrogen loss and
hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at this research and
policies, there's sort of an irrational
[SPEAKER_00]: allocation of resources at this point,
which needs to be corrected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's my final slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I made it in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, so how can we reuse nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, of course, I think that we need to
exploit ecological processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be a challenge because there
are many barriers that exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions and government policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you meet with economists, they like a
single number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like a complex sort of decision
matrix of A, then B, or if C, then go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, what we're doing when we
use these ecological approaches is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to take advantage of these
interactions that actually drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the direction we want to go to
have multiple benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more than yield, to deal with water
quality, to increase soil organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the sort of cascade of positive
outcomes that are offered there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that Haber-Bosch nitrogen
is gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an important tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should be strategic about how we
use it because while we still have cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: fossil fuels and we can supplement with
solar-based technologies, that could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: key strategy for transitioning agriculture
towards sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sorry, I was disoriented for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like you were coming from
above.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's a lot of people talking
about changing diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 40% right now, 40% of the corn is
going to ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We export a huge amount for the grain,
I mean, for feed grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a global diet issue,
not, you know, not just our own diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, there are some
challenges, but I also believe that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that we could increase the diversity
of our landscape without taking a huge hit
[SPEAKER_00]: in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: One strategy would be to substitute wheat
as one of the feed grains, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: already happening in organic systems for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, you know, part of the problem is
this complete reliance on corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I am a strong advocate of,
you know, eating meat in moderation,
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing that, you know, it's
ecological cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that is a, you know,
a much broader, challenging cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, we should not be encouraging
meat production to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we should try to incorporate the
real costs into different foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than have our government,
you know, try to subsidize the production
[SPEAKER_00]: of meat and other animal products,
so that they are inexpensive, maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some way to balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of the work on ecosystem
services is looking at, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we monetize and get some actual,
you know, costs that reflects the true
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental costs or the things that
we've externalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more than I can answer in two
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I must have encouraged this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I do think that we should
continue to provide incentives or
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidies for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's different than other
industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we want to keep as many
people in farming as we can, or as we have
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we want to continue to go
down the road of, you know, reducing the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of farmers even more and having
farms, you know, increase in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no evidence suggesting that that's
really going to improve their ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's questions about the value in
terms of production outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nitrogen tax is something that's been on
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that Europe, the EU has gone
that way in certain respects, putting caps
[SPEAKER_00]: on nitrogen fertilizer rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think that experimenting with a
couple of those kinds of tools to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: help the transition begin, one might be
rewarding farmers for cover, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that NRCS is trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have a small incentive program
for cover, you know, increasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, reducing their fallows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that in certain places,
no till is reasonable and combined with
[SPEAKER_00]: cover cropping, it can be valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Policies that would encourage the
integration of animal and crop production
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they're not spatially separated
and distinct from one another could have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, you know, the ultimately the most
efficient rotation is one that includes
[SPEAKER_00]: crops that relate to animal production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling forages out of the grain
systems is one thing that's led to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problems that we have in those
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be a key thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, first of all, I don't think that
the responsibility can all fall on farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: because the systems that they have now
that are dependent on the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been developed to support this
intensification actually make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to then go backtrack and add
diversity in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be some, you know,
work at the higher level and there needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to be research on how to go back to using
biodiversity in a way that makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: strategically and results in these
multiple benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of managing legumes though,
one benefit because you're impacting so
[SPEAKER_00]: many processes is that you don't have to
manage them as closely because you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you build up the laybile organic matter
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just did a pod experiment with a,
you know, soil from a conventional field,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil from an organic field, 20 years plus
of organic management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about the, the wheat took up about
twice as much nitrogen from the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and was able to produce, you know,
a yield that was twice as high as the
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat from the conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we added some, you know,
small amount of legume residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially it's more of a challenge,
but you can always supplement legumes with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you know, have to keep it pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're aiming for organic
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a farmer was interested in legumes,
I would tell them, I mean, I would give
[SPEAKER_00]: them recommendations about the legume to
fit into their niche, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the open spot they've gotten their
rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe talk to them about how to
eyeball it and be prepared to add some
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer to get them through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once that you've been managing
your soils in our climate organically for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 10, 15 years, that if you have a
low stand of clover, you're, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could potentially get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you might want to supplement,
but I mean, there's still not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: data on that on, you know, what,
how to soil type interact with management
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of rebuilding these labile pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely some of these more
labile pools that are available to plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, are being impacted, which is
what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one question is, since these plants,
these soils do have greater capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralize nitrogen, you know,
are they going to be more prone tonight to
[SPEAKER_00]: leakiness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are cover crops enough to capture that
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have to be, we really have to
avoid bare fouls if we're going to build
[SPEAKER_00]: up these organic matter pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
