[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my name is Henrik Sjöman.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hard thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working at the Swedish University of
Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you some pictures from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to say that I'm not a
native English speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear in mind that sometimes I get
quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I go through a crisis in my head
to find the right words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I say penis, I mean pinus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about pine trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pronounce probably things a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to make sure everybody on
the same page, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for some times in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sweden and Switzerland is something
you have some problem with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big country.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest country in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This map is probably drawn by a Swedish,
because it's actually bigger than it is,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is we have a big country
from north to south to north, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a lot of different kinds of
climates in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we have a really good climate,
by the way, even if we are a very northern
[SPEAKER_00]: country, because we have the Gold Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go by here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes our climates better than we
actually should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very mild climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually very similar to New
England when it comes to the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut,
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of climate we actually have up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are much, much northern than in New
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it looks in the south.
[SPEAKER_00]: In southern Sweden, very agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the north, a lot of mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something in between where I
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a picture in the
midnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a thing I missed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have dark nights in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very light nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two months, we don't have any dark
nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have 24-hour daylights in Sweden,
which I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an introduction to Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the campus I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Swedish University of Agriculture
Science is a campus or is a university
[SPEAKER_00]: that are spread all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the north, in Umeå, where the
university focuses on forestry and
[SPEAKER_00]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are up also in Uppsala, where it's more
agriculture and animal type of direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the south, where I live or where I
work, it's more horticulture, landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: planning, that kind of direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our campus, which is in a very
urban area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the campus is like a green island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Malmö in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Loma and Lund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how flat it is,
very strong agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the campus is very old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the Arboretum, which is the
biggest tree collection or the collection
[SPEAKER_00]: of wooded species in northern Europe and
have trees that are over 350, almost 400
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very big and old place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a castle in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I have my office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why I'm showing this is actually I
would like to invite you, researcher,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have something that we are very
proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something called the Landscape
Laboratory, a thing that we are very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allowed us to, if we come up with an
idea, try to design a woodland,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, Chinese or American or just a
nice design woodlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow us to build it in scale one to
one to see how it works, how it works over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our campus, we have a Landscape
Laboratory that is today 60 hectare large
[SPEAKER_00]: and increasing every year with new
plantation, where we're building things
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how it works in a full scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing with Landscape
Laboratory that we don't have any end date
[SPEAKER_00]: of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can plant things and just following for
10, 15, 50, 100 years, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the lack of the Landscape
Laboratory today is that we would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have more international researcher in the
research group dealing with the Landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it some of the here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also working with wetlands,
stormwater management, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: research field here belongs to the
Landscape Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the bluegrass lane,
but much, much bigger and much cooler,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Nina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Pat.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will do another introduction,
because the research I'm doing together
[SPEAKER_00]: with Nina and company is mostly towards
urban plants and special urban trees and
[SPEAKER_00]: special towards selection, selection of
new species into urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to understand that,
I would like to do just a short
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction of how and why we're doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because international, this is the
problem, not only in Sweden or
[SPEAKER_00]: Scandinavia, but also here in the US,
but all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lack of diversity when it comes
to urban trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study we finished a couple of
years back, where we evaluated the
[SPEAKER_00]: Scandinavian region when it comes to the
diversity of urban trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty scary numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have problems, just talk with Nina
about her inventory this weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had Norway maple, Norway maple,
Norway maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to Sweden, it's lime,
lime, lime, and lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the Scandinavian region.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is pretty scary when you see that
almost 45% of all street trees in Helsinki
[SPEAKER_00]: are the capital of Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one species of lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linden.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Linden, lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, yeah, Linden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just the street trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helsinki haven't inventory other trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you come to Oslo, the capital of
Norway, they have in their tree database
[SPEAKER_00]: where which we use in order to do this
kind of evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also including public trees that are
in park environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, you can see, even if you have
street and park environment, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: three species that stands for half of the
whole tree population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, is not, we talk about
sustainability, and longevity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how sustainable our urban environment
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not sustainable when you rely
on very few species in order to deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the beautification of urban
areas, but also as trees start to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more important in order to deliver
different kind of ecosystem services.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, stormwater management,
urban heat island mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Sweden, it's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use trees in order to have wind
shelter, in order to reduce cooling down
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings, which increase the cost of
heating up the buildings and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trees starting to be very, very
important stuff in an urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just rely on few species,
that's very risky things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same study, we also evaluate to
see, are there any differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of urban habitats?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, street environment or park
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, of course, is not rocket
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty common sense that it's easier
to find a great catalog of species that
[SPEAKER_00]: grows well in park environment because the
park environment, they have better growing
[SPEAKER_00]: condition compared to street environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you find a few species that grow in
street environment, and you find well or
[SPEAKER_00]: perform rather well, you just go for them
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of my research, and together with
Nina, is towards street environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see there is less diversity
compared to park environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example from Oslo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the research we do in Nina is
towards street environment because in hard
[SPEAKER_00]: surface landscape, so to say, is the need
of a great catalog of great performing
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very, very important to find
because in the paved environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: the need of trees is more important
compared to street environment because the
[SPEAKER_00]: few trees that are allowed in the paved
environment needs to deliver much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more compared to trees just in park
environment because that's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, storm water management and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the research is towards street
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will continue because if you just
focus on few tree species, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice picture of a less nice
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Asian longhorn beetle,
which is one of many threats to trees in
[SPEAKER_00]: urban environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just finished a study which was
published earlier this year of the host
[SPEAKER_00]: range of trees that this bug or Asian
longhorn bugs can attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result for the Asian
longhorn beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: 137 species in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytrus longhorn beetle is even worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one we have in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually naturalized in Italy moving
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few species, many diseases, and insects
attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a good calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need is, of course,
increase the catalog of species,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase and also start to using rare and
untreated species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Untraditional species, species that don't
get affected of, for example, this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, and this is another
problem for us in the Scandinavian
[SPEAKER_00]: country, we are poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're extremely poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live actually one of the poorest
regions of the world when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: native tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the New York state, you have
disgusting rich when it comes to native
[SPEAKER_00]: tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's provocative to go out in the forest
here just to name drop all the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you an example how poor we
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the wooded horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the national symbol in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very sad that the story behind it is
just very ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a native horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wooden one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each horse here, it represents the
species that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 34 native tree species in Sweden,
34.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you add diseases or insects
attacking them now or will in the short
[SPEAKER_00]: future attack the trees, we end up with
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you also add urban paved sites to
see which of these species, this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can grow in these kind of habitats,
which are really challenges for trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: we end up with four tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing for us Scandinavian people is
we can't rely on native only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get really provocative when we hear
people, native only, because we can't live
[SPEAKER_00]: in that in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make you sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get frustrated how to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge we are doing or stand in
front of in Sweden in a way is we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, insects attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're attacking our trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have very few native tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need is actually work with more
exotic tree species, tree species that
[SPEAKER_00]: origin from other parts of the world,
but still grows in a climate that are
[SPEAKER_00]: comparable to Sweden, that grows well in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, it's important to
find guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't be angry on landscape
architect or tree planners.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they continue to use the traditional
plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a tree planner working on a very
prestigious project in the center of New
[SPEAKER_00]: York City, you don't start to use a very
rare or a plant material they never used
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do it, you'd be very famous
for the guy that planted trees that died
[SPEAKER_00]: half a year later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to work with safe materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a researcher, I see it's our job to
try to convince tree planners to find
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence of this rare and untraditional
tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find guidance for tree planners in
order to start to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can't force them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find some kind of ground for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have done the last 10 years is
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To traveling around the world,
to actually studying habitats,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural habitats, which have clear
similarities to urban habitats in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Caucasus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually for Chechnya.
[SPEAKER_00]: A place where I not recommend to go on a
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have fantastic flora there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also climate, which are more or less
identical to in the city environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Copenhagen or in
Stockholm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also Carpathian Mountain in Romania.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just showed this picture to Nina before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the bulb flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Colchicum autumnale, a late flowering
bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most poisonous plants we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty impressive that this horse
is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also US, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both West and Eastern US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's areas we study a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some of the parts of the world
we have been traveling around in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: studying habitats and see which other
trees can we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also try to find evidence or guidance
of how they could be a good urban tree for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start to replace the one we're using
too much today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we'll get effect in a short future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the research is really
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of traveling, but also a lot of
walking in mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we start with in the work is start
to do this kind of calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a different kind of calculation
to see which kind of areas of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: have similarities to not only our climate,
but also trying to see which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing habitats can we calculate to see
similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this is from Northeast
Romania and the Republic of Moldavia,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're trying to find just areas
which have similarities to paid
[SPEAKER_00]: environments in Copenhagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the calculation,
we try to add all the information or all
[SPEAKER_00]: the factors that influence trees in paid
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to see where in other parts of the
world can we find more or less exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same growing condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go there and try to understand
it even more, which kind of species grows
[SPEAKER_00]: there and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will explain a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to just make an example of one
of these case studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the Qingling Mountain in
China, where I've been several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first year as a PhD student,
I went here for a whole year, lived here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I met the guy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met a person from Cornell here,
Vinay, from this department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's the one actually introduced me to
Nina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to him, I'm here today,
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Qingling Mountain is an
interesting area for us, in a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: because recent collection from China is
from this area, the Sichuan and Yunnan
[SPEAKER_00]: area, and also the eastern of Tibet,
which is probably the most species-rich
[SPEAKER_00]: region of the world, where you can find a
fantastic richness of species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem here, in this area,
the thing is not hard enough for us in
[SPEAKER_00]: Scandinavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many Scandinavians went up here to the
Manchuria area, to the border to North
[SPEAKER_00]: Korea and Mongolia, Russia, and Northeast
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem up here, the plants are
too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're too continental, starts too early
in the spring, grow too long in autumn,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they are better in northern
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than in the southern Sweden, because they
are too continental, as I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the area we are testing, of course,
we're traveling around in China to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: to see which area actually could be the
best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up in between, in the
Qingling Mountain, China.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like panda bears, this is the place
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will explain how panda bears are one
of the most hated animals for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will explain later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it includes a lot of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this area is actually not too mild
from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mountain is high enough,
almost 4,000 about sea level, meter about
[SPEAKER_00]: sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still you can find some of the
elevation is more or less comparable to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city environment of the Scandinavian
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, calculation to calculate how
good they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go out in the field to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you believe field work is a
glamorous work, you're pretty wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a farmer's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spooning with, this is my driver,
Mr. Ma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the students, Li Yuan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Li Yuan followed two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, I'm never going to
follow you again, because it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too high mountain for walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and Mr. Ma were together for a whole
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know him very well, very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the dinner every night,
noodles and beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the candle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing is to drink
beers who sleep before Mr. Ma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when Mr. Ma starts to snore,
it's impossible to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mr. Ma is a very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when he drive over this kind of
bridges, he asked me to step out and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he drive over first a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he come and get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we drive over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually for a whole year,
Mr. Ma and me working in the Chingling
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the problem working in China is
that there is no good literature,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even for Chinese, to read about the
flora system, how the different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grows in different kind of habitat,
different kind of elevations on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first two or three months was just
for me and Mr. Ma traveling around,
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing up and down, walking up and down
in order to start to learn how the flora
[SPEAKER_00]: system are together and how different
species grow in different kinds of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different kind of habitats and so on,
which is a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also frustrating when you have a
PhD coming that you have to publish
[SPEAKER_00]: papers, all things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to find, we find an elevation,
in this case, 1,500 to 2,000 meter above
[SPEAKER_00]: sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the place where the climates are
more or less exactly the same as in the
[SPEAKER_00]: city environment of Scandinavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to find the right habitats
and the right growing condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microclimate, we have to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's found up here on the warm
south-facing slope, which looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this is not the most nice
place to go, because you have to tie
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you just drop down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the students stop to work just
two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can find habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more or less have strong
similarities to paved sites, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets warm and very dry,
especially after when the snow melts or
[SPEAKER_00]: when after a rain, it dries up very
quickly, which is what it is in paved
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the field work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the morning, two hours,
climb up here, do the work, inventory the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, take soil sample, drill the tree,
measuring the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All together, it gives you good
information of which species grow on these
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and what the sites represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you can see which trees grow
quick and which trees grow very slow on
[SPEAKER_00]: these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes you good information on how
to collect the next one, how to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: the species that you should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're more interested in the
trees that can tolerate this growing
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, but at the same time grow
quickly fast and delivering in a rather
[SPEAKER_00]: short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because earlier collection is just out,
collect seed, take it home, and start to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes two, three generations of
gardeners before you start to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by doing this, you can do a first
screening in the field to don't collect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trees that don't have the future as
urban tree and focus on the one that have
[SPEAKER_00]: the great potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the work we have done here in
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example of things that
we do in field in order to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: with tree planners and also researcher of
the findings we do in field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very sharp slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This top of the ridge is just one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go on balance when you're walking
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, you have a north-facing slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a south-facing slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distance from here to here is just
20 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the species combination between these
slopes are completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the south slope, we have plants that
have the strategy to handle warm and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes really, really dry condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you find almost just oaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wintergreen oaks, but also broadleaf oaks,
and also two and one needle pines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the south-facing slope instead,
here it's just more moist because after a
[SPEAKER_00]: rain, it dries up much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the evapotranspiration is less compared
to the south-facing slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants here, they are very much
needed to have moist and cool condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, they are more shade
tolerant because they have to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the restriction is not below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restriction are above ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these trees are park trees that are
very successful in moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich habitats and also really good to
compete in this kind of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this side, restriction are not the
sunlight because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tree crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a lot of sunlight through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the restriction is below ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it is in urban condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, urban paid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Restriction are below ground, not above
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this condition, it seems like the
water is always running.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trees are on the sides of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't have stagnant water in this
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in urban conditions, the trees are
usually irrigated, and the water is
[SPEAKER_02]: usually stagnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the design of planting pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never, ever allow to have
standing water in the planting pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have done a wrong design of your
planting pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have well-drained always
also in the planting pit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drainage is a key thing in urban
plantation anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's watered down, something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example that you can
see the difference between different
[SPEAKER_00]: habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when you go out in the field,
you can see the use potential of the trees
[SPEAKER_00]: when you are in natural habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just some of the findings
China is extremely rich in species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many species have never, ever been grown
in or outside China.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this, Ulmusglaucessions,
it's called Yunnan Elm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never been outside China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's in cultivation in Alnard,
but also we have shared to the Kew Garden
[SPEAKER_00]: in the UK just to be sure that if our
dies, we still have some in the Kew and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small-leaf Elm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bark looks like the Selkova.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows really, really well and fast
on these extremely dry habitats and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have any problem with the Dutch
undersea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suddenly, this is a good urban tree,
especially for paid environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also you can find trees that we know
for a very exclusive park arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have never go outside this
arboretum or botanical garden because we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know enough about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this habitat study gives more
information about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Exocordia giraldea or the
Staphyllia holocarpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't say an English name because I have
no idea what's an English name on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are available in arboretum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through this habitat study,
we can start to know more about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to use them maybe in more public
plantations and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of research is not only to
collect new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's equally important to find more
information of things that we have around
[SPEAKER_00]: us but we don't dare to use because we
don't know enough about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a more example of this Peonia
sofroticosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the growing habitat where it
grows, more rocky places.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just two examples of Corallus
tree-growing hazels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Corallus farjacei with its peeling
orange bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Corallus chinensis,
which have a bark that looks similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shagbark hickory.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two beautiful trees that have never
been in a more horticulture perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have the potential to become
very, very good horticulture trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Corallus chinensis have very close
relationship with the Corallus coluna,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is more common in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, hybrids together when they meet
each other in the Central Asia somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one which are Corallus chinensis in
cultivation today is this hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the true Corallus chinensis is not
available in cultivation today because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have this bark, this beautiful
bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some early flowering trees and
also some late flowering trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Correteria paniculata,
the Chinese tree that grows more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: on bare rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most drought-tolerant trees and
the research me and Nina are doing here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, which I'll hopefully show you
later on, also show that it's so,
[SPEAKER_00]: so drought-tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this perfect tree for the urban
environment, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just took this picture because it's a
big leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy is 180 tall, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another case study, Romania Moldavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, calculation about the
habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why Romania and Eastern Europe is one
of the most interesting area of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to climate-smart trees for
urban environment is that we already have
[SPEAKER_00]: a climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: East of Carpathian Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Europe, Sweden, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Alps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Carpathian starts up here and
goes like this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Transylvania where the Dracula
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But east of the mountains here,
the west winds, the moist winds from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlantic, from the Gulf Stream,
more or less ends here in Transylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the west part of the Transylvania,
it's very wet, very moist, very rich,
[SPEAKER_00]: big trees, big forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the east, no much rain comes over
the Carpathian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have more or less, as I said,
on the east side of Rocky Mountains,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dry, cold winters, cold and dry
winters, warm and dry summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this area, east of the Carpathian here,
but also down here in the Caucasus region,
[SPEAKER_00]: have more or less exactly the climate and
growing condition as we find in the city
[SPEAKER_00]: environment when we add urban heat island
effects and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we have been a lot in
Eastern Europe to try to investigate
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the landscape is not that sexy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the place you go when you
visit Europe the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: These great, huge steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the steps are most famous for their
meadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the meadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukraine zebra.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a zoo in southern Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, now it's occupied by Russia,
where you can find some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting meadows of the steppe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how beautiful the steppe is
when it's flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Romania.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like perennial plants that could be
used for in roundabouts or in roof
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening and so on, this is the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the area to go because they are
more or less growing in that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this steppe environment,
you also find patches of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This very famous steppe forest of Eastern
Europe, which includes many species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks when you do field
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have Mr. Ma with me, and here I'm
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is their dinner in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's canned ham.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when these cans of ham moves to
Sweden, they just change the label from
[SPEAKER_00]: canned ham to cat food because it's smell
and taste probably the same because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the dinner when you eat canned ham in the
Romanian way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a tip for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're camping here, don't throw apples
you haven't eaten outside the tent because
[SPEAKER_00]: then the wild boar comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wild boar here looked like the
orcs in the Lord of the Rings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to have a couple of
wild boars fighting for your apples in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to sleep after that kind of
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that glamorous to do this kind
of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is what you find here,
it's some of the most interesting trees
[SPEAKER_00]: for urban environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Sorbis terminalis,
that's the one growing here with these
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful autumn colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the orcs here are the Quercus
frinetum, the Hungarian oak, which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most drought tolerant, but also one
of the most beautiful orcs for urban
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also silver linden, is that right?
Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilia tormentosa, which also is one of the
most drought tolerant among the linden
[SPEAKER_00]: trees anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, some of the species
are in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we believe is through this habit
of study, we can find more evidence to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince both nursery to start to produce
them in higher numbers and bigger trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also convince landscape architects and
planners to start to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only to just grab new trees,
but also convince people to start to use
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing when it comes to plant
hunting and trying to find good things is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't have to find new species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can equally find better types of
already introduced species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant hunting days are far from
over when it comes to finding really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good horticultural plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you a couple of examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a solution of a 100 years old
mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you about, you know,
Ernest Wilson, rather famous plant hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually hired in Arnold Arboretum
in Boston for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first time he was in China to
collect, he was collecting the doubletree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same trip he wrote in his diary
that, today I saw some beautiful flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: magnolias.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was red flowering and one was white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must come back in autumn to collect
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went back in autumn, collect the seeds
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he's sending home to Veitch
Nursery, because they was paying for the
[SPEAKER_00]: trip there, he accidentally mixed both the
seed in the same box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And send it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nursery took them and start to
propagate them and they grow fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after five or six years, this nursery
have a sellout because the man of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery said, I'm fed up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to sell this nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, there was six plants from
this magnolia collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was selling to different parts of
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: One at Kew Garden, one at Bodnant Garden,
and one at Carr Hayes Castle in Cornwall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they started flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one at Bodnant and Kew Garden
looked like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, beautiful flowers, white with this
purple base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get the name magnolia sprangerei.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one at Carr Hayes Castle,
oops, it had red pinkish, really dark
[SPEAKER_00]: pinkish flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unique with this thing is that it
have a similar strong color, both on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the teppel, as inside of the
teppel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when magnolias flowering,
they have strong colors on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they open up, they have less
color and lose much of the color when they
[SPEAKER_00]: start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this dark colored magnolia sprangerei
kept the colors even when it's flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives much, much more color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave the name diva, the best name
for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people get very excited over this
diva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have used it a lot, the different kind
of crossings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you read Wilson's diary,
he said a whole valley of this diva,
[SPEAKER_00]: this dark coloring magnolias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 100 years, plant hunters and stupid
people like us have been traveling to this
[SPEAKER_00]: area to try to find this valley,
but haven't been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead, people said, oh, just a myth,
just a mutation, something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought, since I'm going to spend a
whole year in China, why doesn't we do a
[SPEAKER_00]: test to find this valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we can find some good moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is this area is very rich
in pandas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cute, a little bit bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with this bare is that if
it shows up in a forest, the government
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out the people in the forest and
protect a huge piece of forest for this
[SPEAKER_00]: panda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's impossible for Western people to
come in in this forest to study,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is this damn panda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Beijing to try to find
some paper to get into this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: no chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, you have to go to the area and
drink yourself into the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is try to go to the
province city and find the boss there and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to drink you up in a hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is after about eight days of
constant eating and drinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the forestry, the highest boss
in the forestry in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the man from the Communist
Party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys we was drinking with for
about two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like one drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the morning drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 11 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an early lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how it looks later in the
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my friend, Alan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to drink not every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to spread it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to split the night between us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this night was Alan's night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, after seven or eight days hard
drinking, this is actually how you go in
[SPEAKER_00]: Caucasus as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only China.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after some hard drinking, we get the
access into this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start to interview people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen this magnolia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after some couple of days driving,
we found this man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find actually a tree with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you see, it's at his home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually found the one we were
looking for, the one with a strong color
[SPEAKER_00]: on the inside of the temple, the same as
the outside of the temple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we would like to find the wild
population of this species or this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnolia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we continue to driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a small bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find a farmer that said,
yeah, I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably knows more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and his family went into the van.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to his place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, but I know another guy
that knows a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a while, we have like 20 people
in a bus, crowded, driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the place we ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally find a guy that, yeah,
I know a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, we parked the car down here
and walk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we go over a road, over a ridge,
we start to see these ones, several of
[SPEAKER_00]: pink clouds in the valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get closer, we saw these ones,
even better than the diva in the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually are reintroducing this diva
that was collected 100 years ago from
[SPEAKER_00]: Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, we have collecting at least 40
new genotypes of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, we get more genes into the
cultivation, which we can use for
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, we have found these dark pink
flowering magnolias in habitats,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is much colder than the one that
grew before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much possible to find some
good-looking, hardy divas in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another example, magnolia biondi.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really boring magnolia, three
centimeters large, white with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: purple base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more taxonomic interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought it was interesting because
magnolia biondi is one of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiest magnolias.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we can use it as a good parent
in order to find some harder stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was young then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But focus on this one, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, after a while, when we start to
try to find some magnolia biondi,
[SPEAKER_00]: we start to see the variation within the
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really quick, we realized that the
most boring type of the species is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: available in cultivation today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more interesting types are still
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an example of the
variation of the species magnolia biondi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go from this rather big,
seven to eight centimeter large flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: magnolias, which have more like the tulip
shape of the flower, to these bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a collective behind a
house where they throw all the rubbish
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, the working name on this is
white trash, this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a very popular thing
here in the US, we believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see, there are so much things
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant hunting today is actually to
find the better ones that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to introduce rare or
untraditional species, it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: find good looking types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the types which are
available when you go to the Kew Garden or
[SPEAKER_00]: to Arnold Arboretum, Morris Arboretum,
some of them are the worst types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still much out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go through it, albosinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type you buy in the nursery in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it looks in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: See the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you want to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilatomentosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how the species looks in
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tree, but look how it grows here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impossible to prune or do something
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even this one, this is from the
plantation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good looking tree, narrow tree
crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look how it looks inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good tree for street
environments, but it's impossible to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a street environment because you have to
hire up the tree crown in order to get
[SPEAKER_00]: buses or cars underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did this spring, we went down
to Yash in Northeast Romania.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you read Russian poems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yash is famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: For its silver linden, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you read Russian poems,
they write beautiful things of Yash and
[SPEAKER_00]: its beautiful avenues with silver linden
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a famous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did actually, we went down
there for three days to do the smash and
[SPEAKER_00]: grab to find some trees of silver limes
that grows more as we want and as urban
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we find is this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a central leader, good tree
architecture in a tree crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the thing we do a lot of
hunting to find better types of trees that
[SPEAKER_00]: could, in order to find better types,
they could be more useful and start to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a good complement to the traditional plant
materials that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, that was just a short
introduction, what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing now here in Cornell
is actually another project, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a complement to this, actually to learn
more about how tolerable different species
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a project we call Shut the Hell Up
or Die, which actually is what it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about, trying to mapping how much a tree
can shut the hell up when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing now is trying to find,
to read the Turgo loss point of trees in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to see how much drought they can
take before the cell structure in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves actually destroys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And magnolias destroys very early,
which shows, for the landscape planners
[SPEAKER_00]: and landscape gardeners, they are not
useful for paving line.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, there are other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Eukomia or many oaks,
but also some of the maple, which have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very high or low Turgo loss point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, very low Turgo loss point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take very, very high drought
without getting damaged in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows that these trees are better
suited for urban pave sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a general thing is trying to find
pieces in the puzzle to show that these
[SPEAKER_00]: species are better than that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, we can start to argue
that changing from the traditional plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material to a more untraditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work is not only to tree
planners, but also towards nursery in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to start to produce these
untraditional tree materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ginkgo is growing in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Ginkgo grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ginkgo has started to be this rare
plant from an arboretum to become more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the work we have done
to show that this is better, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: than what it is already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very successful in transferring dirty
material from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were talking about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you did, how complicated the
process was?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is, it's not possible to go
there and just collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a collaboration together
with the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a very good collaboration together
with the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Northwest University of
Agriculture and Forestry in China
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do it as a researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do it as a commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need is that we can collect,
as a scientist, it's possible for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect, plant it in my research field and
see how it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in our research, we have four
hectares of Chinese materials that we're
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to commercialize it,
we have to go back to China to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: contract with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a waste of time to get a contract
before you know how it will develop as an
[SPEAKER_00]: urban tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're better to collect it as a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as a scientist, I stand above some
of the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK for me to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to commercialize it,
I have to have permits from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it can go afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's possible to get afterwards to get
the rights and the paper in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialize some of the trees that we
collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can take one more question from
Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years do you have to grow these
typical trees before you can really
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the first collection we did was
2003, when I was just a research
[SPEAKER_00]: assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this boring job to take my backpack
and go to China and collect for the
[SPEAKER_00]: professor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first job as a research
assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But already 2003, that's 10 years now,
or over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already start to propagate some of the
materials from that in order to test them,
[SPEAKER_00]: how good they are at propagating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see almost after four to seven
years, you see the potential of some of
the plant material.
So then you can propagate them.
And then we plant them in more places in
Sweden in order to evaluate the hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have to take 60 or 70 or 100
years before you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the plant material collected with
Nina here, for example, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: maples, but also some of the oats,
we can already see today after five or six
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow so well,
[SPEAKER_00]: have grown so good during some of the
coldest winter we have for 50 years in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so interesting, so we're going to
start to propagate already now after six
[SPEAKER_00]: or seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have a good crown hierarchy
with a century in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the trees shows their
potential much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them shows early, some later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good ulcer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
