[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Josh Randall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the natural resources educator at
Cornell Cooperative Extension Niagara
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk specifically about
weatherization of homes and what that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like in terms of saving energy,
reducing greenhouse gases and protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also serve as a clean energy advisor
with the Western clean energy hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have responsibilities that I guess
transcend that and are really focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: residential opportunities in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have thoughts on that,
I will have a table tomorrow at our energy
[SPEAKER_00]: expo, which you're all definitely invited
to come to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can talk more about some of those
residential opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I know that Jenny actually covered
a few of these terms, but I always like to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to make sure everybody's on the same
page when we have these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so just going through really
quickly, you know, the idea that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about here is in the
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the ideas that we should
have when we're thinking about these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate change, these are just long
term changes to stability or
[SPEAKER_00]: predictability of weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainability is the use of resources
without endangering our future generations
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resiliency is ability for a system or an
individual to bounce back from unexpected
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental justice is equitable
distribution of environmental resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decarbonizing is the reduction of the
amount or intensity of greenhouse gases
[SPEAKER_00]: released by a process of building any kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most importantly, the thing that I'm
going to talk to you about today is
[SPEAKER_00]: weatherization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is weatherization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jenny gave a very brief explanation of
this, but I like pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a diagram for you guys to think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's imagine we have a very basic
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a door, there's a window,
there's a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can even note there's actually
ways, I'm not tall enough, to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how there's actually air moving up
into that roof through those little
[SPEAKER_00]: openings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's really, really important to
think about then is that every single
[SPEAKER_00]: place where you have a hole in the house,
that's a place for air to move in or out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means in the summer, you're losing
your AC, and in the winter, you're losing
[SPEAKER_00]: your heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, more importantly, the real risk
to people that we'll talk about later is
[SPEAKER_00]: that means that any outdoor air pollution
immediately becomes indoor air pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we do about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we weatherize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can look like a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really biggest priorities are
actually going to be focused on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this could be something like adding
bats of insulation or adding baffles to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to control the where air is flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could mean adding additional insulation
in the walls and rim joists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could mean adding door sweeps or adding
additional air sealing along the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different places that
we can try to prioritize, but we should
[SPEAKER_00]: really be thinking about this as a whole
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially since we're thinking about
things as whole systems, we can then try
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about how this might affect other
kinds of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm going to start talking
to you a little bit about health,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, economics, and environmental
outcomes of weatherization.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of historical background.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jenny's favorite figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves to show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is actually a really great
breakdown of what's going on in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, buildings and transportation
are the biggest components of our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you make a quick note,
actually, the green is also energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that that energy has to
also be a part of that transportation and
[SPEAKER_00]: building components.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really means that we're really
thinking about, in people's individual
[SPEAKER_00]: day-to-day lives, more than 50% of the
greenhouse gas emissions are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't exclusively think about this
as being a problem that our large
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations and businesses have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we have to be able to
take on as a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, the Climate Leadership
and Community Protection Act was passed in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 by New York State, and it resulted in
the creation of a scoping plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was some really big requests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, they wanted to see that
we could have 85% of greenhouse gases
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could look like a lot of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, one of the things that
they mentioned directly in that scoping
[SPEAKER_00]: plan is that 1 to 2 million households
across New York State are really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need to be electrified with heat
pumps by 2030 to be able to reach our
[SPEAKER_00]: goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that we really need to be
thinking about this in terms of how are
[SPEAKER_00]: people in this room, in our communities,
across the state going to actually be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet these goals, weatherize their
homes, and actually be able to achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, we also have to
think about this in the lens of a just
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State explicitly states this in
the scoping plan that we must ensure that
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged communities receive at least
35% of all of the benefits that New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State produces through their expenses on
this sort of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I think this is one of the
more important things is that
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged communities is a very broad
term that New York State actually uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it includes places like low and
moderate income people and areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as communities that had land use
associated with historical discrimination
[SPEAKER_00]: or disinvestment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like a really big phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what that means is that people
and places that were a part of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that we developed the state have to be
able to be the ones that actually get the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits from us further developing the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of Western New York
because that's where I work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are actually in blue all of the
places that New York State considers to be
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I want to highlight is that
essentially the entire city of Buffalo,
[SPEAKER_00]: the city of Niagara Falls, the city of
Lockport are all considered disadvantaged,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so is the Tuscarora Nation,
the Cataraugus Nation, and the Tonawana
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we really have here is some of
the areas we would normally think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even more interestingly, you see a lot
of ag land is also considered to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantaged community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we have to think about this
as not just the people that normally get
[SPEAKER_00]: considered in these conversations,
but it's a much bigger pool of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be involved in the decision
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, this means that
the communities that became disadvantaged
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of the externalized costs of
development have to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: modern development as a part of the
remedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the groups, the people, the places that
actually receive the sort of disadvantaged
[SPEAKER_00]: nature because of this investment or
discrimination have to be the ones to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive the 35% of the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now I'm going to talk about
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really important map right there
on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Energy Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how they kind of think about how
much insulation people need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of like the bare minimum idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they group the state into a bunch of
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what that means is that
there's going to be diversity across the
[SPEAKER_00]: state in terms of what people actually
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, 90% of all homes in the United
States are considered under-insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, like I said, we have a
diversity of insulation needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But almost everybody in New York State is
expected to need R60 in their attics and
[SPEAKER_00]: R14 in walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That R stands for resistance value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it tells you how much the
insulation is able to resist the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of energy through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the higher the number, either the
thicker the insulation has to be or the
[SPEAKER_00]: less conductive that material would have
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that really means is that people
are not seeing the insulation that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need when they constructed the house,
when they've done insulation in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really requires then that we take
it a little bit more seriously and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work to make sure that insulation
is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, it becomes even worse when
we consider that most attics only ever
[SPEAKER_00]: have floors insulated and never the actual
ceilings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crawl spaces and rim joists are
considered dangerously uninsulated in most
[SPEAKER_00]: places, as well as the fact that New York
State actually worked to try to remedy
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this with their stretch energy go
to 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: But municipalities have to individually
approve that in order for that to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: function where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have a number of problems
that are actually made worse because we
[SPEAKER_00]: also have an asbestos insulation crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because some homes will never be able
to have wall insulation if you have slat
[SPEAKER_00]: walls in a wooden home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So saving energy is a very difficult thing
for a lot of parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also comes down to a thing about
who's even really focusing on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thinking that this saving
energy conversation really leads well into
[SPEAKER_00]: a larger conversation about behavioral
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken gave a really great talk there about
what it looks like to have that behavioral
[SPEAKER_00]: change in a specific industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to potentially be thinking
about this across all industries and all
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we turn out the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who actually cares about saving energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a few people that should
think about it the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that want to see the immediate
financial benefits for their household.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that want to see a more efficient
grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that want to prolong the
mechanical electrical equipment in their
[SPEAKER_00]: household.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your furnace, your hot water heater,
all of those things do better the less
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive and intensely you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really have to think about
energy saving as being part of these
[SPEAKER_00]: normal behaviors that people already care
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that utilities are already
seeking rate increases across New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State because energy use continues to
increase across all times of day and all
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons in part because of some industries
increasing their use, but also in part
[SPEAKER_00]: because New York State continues to
develop and expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that, like I said,
buildings are the largest category of
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions and space heating is the largest
proportion of that building emission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you care about climate change or if
you care about financial benefits for
[SPEAKER_00]: households, you must care about building
decarbonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did not fix itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are a couple of other figures I
wanted to make sure I threw in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of talk a little bit about why
energy saving is so important in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, that's actually from the
New York State Comptroller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually represents the
percentage of customers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be in arrears by utility
across New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see even the minimum,
which is National Grid and Long Island,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 8% of all the customers are
considered to be arrears in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's two years after COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a huge number of people that are
in financial straits because of the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can't afford their energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually gets worse when you
consider that on the right, that's from
[SPEAKER_00]: EIA, that is the number in billions of
dollars of rate increases across the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, across all the utilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing utilities are increasing
their rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: People already can't afford them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are they actually going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to look towards
weatherization.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little about
greenhouse gases now to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom there, that's actually,
I think, a really interesting figure so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can kind of get an idea of how this
stuff works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about it in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally, I'm trying to think about
this in terms of weatherization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of this also kind of leads into
electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially, that's where we see the
most benefits for greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we try to weatherize,
we have to realize that a lot of this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in preparation for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just weatherization on its own is
actually able to reduce the total US
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions by 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually 4.7 exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just insulating homes across the US is
a massive reduction in our total
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also then shift people better
towards heat pumps because we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be realistic with what people actually
need with terms like right sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that figure in the bottom
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's considered to be approach number
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be how you would design a
heat pump in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that really is saying is we can
try to make sure that the heat pump is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work at even low temperatures
without wasting too much energy at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually do this better if
you've already done the insulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've already done the energy
assessments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to think about this in
advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I said, too, we have to
think about how this also relates to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of our other movements we're having.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that refrigeration is actually
rapidly changing in New York state and
[SPEAKER_00]: across the United States as we start to
phase out the worst refrigerants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's going to be a process that's
going to happen over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it especially is related to this
because we know that HVAC units are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ones that contain those most
harmful greenhouse gases in abundance and
[SPEAKER_00]: that whenever they get repairs,
they get off gassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be ready to be able to do
the weatherization and to be prepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: the electrification, but also know that
that's also a part of a bigger scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: how greenhouse gases are going to be
reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are another couple of really
interesting figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little about them as I go
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we also know is that as we're
reducing greenhouse gases, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have tighter home envelopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that they're going to need
to rely less on ACs, which are already
[SPEAKER_00]: considered to be grid heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the expectation on that
bottom right figure is that New York
[SPEAKER_00]: state, and that's actually from the New
York Independent Service Operator,
[SPEAKER_00]: the New York state as a whole is going to
be moving from a summer peaking system to
[SPEAKER_00]: a winter peaking system by 2037.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that as a whole,
we're no longer going to see our most
[SPEAKER_00]: energy use in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see it in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that is believed because we're
going to be shifting towards electric
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also hopefully going to be
because people are able to actually do the
[SPEAKER_00]: weatherization work and not have to waste
as much energy on air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should also should, I can't promise
this, it should also reduce dangerous and
[SPEAKER_00]: wasteful forms of heating and cooling like
leaving your oven open or leaving your
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator door open.
[SPEAKER_00]: People die every single year from doing
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a completely avoidable death
just through the use of weatherization
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also is going to mean that we could
potentially even out demand, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be able to actually phase out the
peaker plants, which we were not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do in this next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that top right map is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the peaker plants are in
New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that when the grid hits
peak load, they have to turn on additional
[SPEAKER_00]: power plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see right there in the middle
of New York state that there's a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: gray blob, that's a giant oil plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of upstate is still reliant on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go down to downstate,
a lot of that's all natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of pretty large oil
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still very reliant on fossil fuels
every time we hit those really intense
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the summer because people need
that AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to talk about is
protecting health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I try to really be
the most forward with when I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with people in my day-to-day work,
because I think this is the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: people forget the most about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, Ken did a really great job
talking about how this works in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that these are health concerns
related to fossil fuels, related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that we've designed our society
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give a quick overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these things is going to be indoor
air quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, outdoor air quality is the
greatest predictor of what indoor air
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can reduce fossil fuel use,
we're going to see better indoor air
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, we can do things,
like I said, reduce air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also reduce mold growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that a large percentage of the
mold that's happening in people's homes is
[SPEAKER_00]: because of under-insulation in attics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that radon and rodent feces
are coming up through people's crawl
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces because those are also
under-insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that we can think about is
ensuring that the efficiency of our
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical electrical equipment systems is
going to be able to maintain themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that's important is
because our equipment increases carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: monoxide production as they age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so especially if you're in areas where
you might have your furnace, your hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water heater, in an area where you might
be having it on the same floor as where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are staying, that's a real danger
to people as they age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means we can maintain higher water
temperatures and reduce our legionnaires
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had people in the last year die in
Albany because of legionnaires,
[SPEAKER_00]: and likely it's because we were not able
to keep that water temperature at the
[SPEAKER_00]: prerequisite level, and it was allowed to
then grow uncontrolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also then produce less thermal
pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make sure that we're not going to
be increasing heat island effects in
[SPEAKER_00]: cities by having all these buildings
always outputting all this excess heat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can reduce pest entrance to the
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can try to reduce the number of rats
and stink bugs and flies coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: people's homes just by air sealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most important thing, and the
reason why Buffalo cares about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we can make sure that there's more
hours of safety during extreme weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost people in 2022, and those were
also avoidable deaths just by increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: weatherization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I had to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and I know we're not doing
questions now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
