[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, good afternoon, good
evening, depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Lucia Vignelli.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm organizing this fourth edition of our
Webinar series.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we have decided to focus on
Hemgrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have eight amazing speakers who have
kindly agreed to give talks on various
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are kicking it off with a Morgan Tweed
from INT Hemp and a member of the Hemphill
[SPEAKER_00]: Coalition who is here with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is our first webinar of this
year, I'd like to briefly explain how it
[SPEAKER_00]: will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: EST, allow participants to join and once
attendance stabilizes, I'll introduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presentation would last approximately
45 minutes and we are going to follow it
[SPEAKER_00]: by a 15-minute Q&A session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll wrap up by thanking the speaker
for their time and insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please submit your questions for the
speaker using the Q&A button and use the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat for any other communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The webinars will be recorded and uploaded
to our School of Integrative Plant Science
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel, SIPS YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to leave early, or you want to
watch it again, you can just go to YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find the talks from this year
and the talks from the past editions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further ado, I'll have the honor
of introducing today's speaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan Tweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan is a founding partner of INT Hemp,
a Montana-based hemp food and fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: company located in Fort Benton.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the chief executive officer and has
helped design, construct, commission,
[SPEAKER_00]: and operate one of the largest hemp
processing campuses in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: with their oil seed and fiber facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan graduated from the University of
Missouri with a bachelor's in chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer and then worked for Archer
Daniels Midland in Decatur, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: launching her career in agriculture and
food processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morgan and her father Ken Elliott founded
INT Hemp, with the mission to create new
[SPEAKER_00]: and rewarding opportunities for rural
agriculture communities and companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: see the great opportunity in hemp grain
and fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe in the goodness of hemp and
its ability to not only bring another
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue source to the farm, but also
believe in its power as a strong rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, combating persistent weeds and
helping build soy health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Morgan, it's all yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm very honored to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're on a short clock,
so I'll jump right into it, but I really
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate the opportunity to be invited
to participate in the webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for this series ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I set the stage for some other
great speakers that I saw listed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll be some really good
content, and this will just be a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch of the surface that they can
follow up with with more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Cornell asked that I sort of go into a
little bit of INT Hemp as a business and
[SPEAKER_01]: our capabilities, what we do, and then
we're going to focus on grain production
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of end with food and feed
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the executive director of the Hemp
Bee Coalition as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, personal passion and a lot of work
that's good work that's been done by the
[SPEAKER_01]: people there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, a little bit about INT Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we are a certified bee crop
organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our town of Fort Benton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's located at 45 minutes northeast of
Great Falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know Montana, we're north central.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a really productive agricultural
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of grain is grown around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major rotation crops that we're
working with are winter wheat,
[SPEAKER_01]: spring wheat, pulses, some forage
production as well, and we've just been
[SPEAKER_01]: really thankful and blessed to be in this
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really embraced us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 1,500 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right along the Missouri River here,
so very historic and beautiful town.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a big fan of Lewis and Clark,
I encourage you to come out and visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a rich history there and it's
just a great community to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highlight that we're a certified bee
corp because it really articulates well
[SPEAKER_01]: our business and our values.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of communicate success with our
people, our planet, and our profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we want to focus on those things in
that order.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's really voted well for
us and the success that we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were established in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad's been doing Hemp though since
about 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the first license in Montana all
the way back to the 2014 Farm Bill and has
[SPEAKER_01]: been working it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left my career with ADM and as crazy of
an adventure as it started, it sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: really took effect after the Farm Bill
passed in December of 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started in grain manufacturing and then
quickly evolved into fiber as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just a few photos of our people and
the work we're doing in our facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mean a lot to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what encourages and inspires me
every day and just hope to do a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission and our vision, I'm not going
to read it in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely come onto our website,
but I think it does a great job of
[SPEAKER_01]: articulating what we see and what we want
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I like to highlight is that we
really want to create value in the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very clear need that we have as an
industry is continuing to focus on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right steps in the process and we want to
do it with integrity and really focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, focusing on the relationship
with the farmer, making sure that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting the last cut, but their needs
and their integration is considered at the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then obviously, really championing the
opportunity to work pioneers of different
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurial businesses that see hemp
as a real opportunity to create lasting
[SPEAKER_01]: change, whether it's as a material or a
food or feed ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really starts on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go into quite a bit of
agronomy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you guys have some other
sessions to be even more focused on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but back to our mission, this is why it
started for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to create value in rural Montana
and we wanted to see a new rotation crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that could bring revenue to our friends
and family that were just having a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: time with the price of wheat every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really fun to see starting with
grain and then working with fiber genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two very different production
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to focus on grain today,
but we've learned a lot in the six plus
[SPEAKER_01]: years that we've been doing production and
really understand the value and importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of focusing on the farm first.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be updated a little bit,
but generally speaks to where we're at on
[SPEAKER_01]: the presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana is definitely an ag state and a
lot of value manufacturing has also
[SPEAKER_01]: brought our economy up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see here in the stars are our
facility in Fort Benton, which is where
[SPEAKER_01]: all of our manufacturing is done,
and then our main corporate office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have an office in Belgrade as
well, which serves as a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a lot of our sales and finance team
is located there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can see all of our partner farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been updated for a few years,
so there's more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we're pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana is a really big state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to cover a lot of territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually done some production in
Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done some seed production also in
the Midwest, Kansas, Texas, Indiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've started to have a good pulse on
generally what genetics works and what
[SPEAKER_01]: regions, but been hyper-focused on trying
to optimize yields and efficiencies in our
[SPEAKER_01]: region as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really focus on that grower
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've to date had about 30,000 acres that
we've managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't personally grow, but we work with
farmers and contract with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the production model that you see
with most commodities, but it's worked
[SPEAKER_01]: well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focusing on family farms, we'd like to say
within 400-mile radius, closer is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 miles would be awesome, but the
reality is we have to go where the acres
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being geographically diverse also helps us
mitigate some risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a full-time agronomist on
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do also usually have a seasonal intern
that will help as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're there from everything from seed
selection to when they're planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing seed counts and stand counts
throughout the season, helping them with
[SPEAKER_01]: their nutrition program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very hands-on relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get feedback from them throughout the
year as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from seed and fiber storage to
transportation and material handling
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the licensee of X-59, which is a
variety based out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worked really well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're also the owner of IH Williams,
which is a high-yielding fiber variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also known as SS Beta in a lot of
university trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have heard of both of those
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen success in our region in both,
and then have continued to keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_01]: and trial a lot of other varieties as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is always to provide the best
variety for our farmers to maximize their
[SPEAKER_01]: yields and meeting the quality specs that
we need as a processor as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really the buckets of products that we
make fall either into hemp food,
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp feed, or hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to talk a whole lot about
hemp fiber, but we do have a decortication
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those products that we're going to be
selling is bast fiber, cleaned in size
[SPEAKER_01]: herd, and then some co-products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The general number I think that's nice to
articulate to folks is between our
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, we can manage somewhere
between 20,000 and 30,000 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really depends on what that production mix
looks like in terms of dual-purpose or
[SPEAKER_01]: single-purpose production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I say that just in the grand scheme of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the largest processors in the
United States, and 10,000 to 30,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: is not even a drop in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely an industry that has a lot
of room to grow and a lot of room for
[SPEAKER_01]: other processors to get onboarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know generally, farmers are definitely
interested in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for a new cash crop or
something at least competitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're also looking for
something that adds value to their
[SPEAKER_01]: rotation to their soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll dig into that a little bit more as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quick look at our facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm not going to go into too much
detail on our production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can definitely cover questions,
but I was asked to do some other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of these locations are in Fort
Benton.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about not even half mile away from
one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left is our fiber facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the raw straw bales that are
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually try to keep about a month's
worth of inventory on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the right is our oilseeds
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seed cleaning and then seed
processing in two separate buildings with
[SPEAKER_01]: some onsite storage as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have the menu of certifications that
we're really proud of and we're hard for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our annual organic audit yesterday
that went over really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just been blessed with a great
quality team and a production team that
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to hold us up to these high
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are confident with what we communicate
to customers for both of our businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some brands, just because we've continued
to garner more value in the supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: and so going further down, the value chain
has helped us to continue to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: The products that we sell mostly
fiber-related are Olwok's and Hemptana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start with bedding products,
but then we have the opportunity to also
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight our supplement and feed products
with oilseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two animal care products,
one's more targeted to a smaller animal
[SPEAKER_01]: versus a farm and ranch style animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have our Montana Gold,
which is represented both in lawn and
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we've also been successful in
converting it into textile and been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with some smaller brands to launch
our Montana Gold into some finished
[SPEAKER_01]: apparel products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then our IH oilseed products, most of our
food is being sold in bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have currently a retail facing
brand, but continue to support other
[SPEAKER_01]: brands both domestically and
internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Current applications that you see us in,
a lot of this is fiber just since it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: more diverse sectors that it can play in,
but we see non-wovens and composites as a
[SPEAKER_01]: big opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absorption, textiles, soil amendments,
human and animal nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a picture taken at Ag on the
Mall.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're partners with the National Hemp
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a great setup in DC and it was
nice to showcase some of our products
[SPEAKER_01]: along with some other well-known hemp
processors in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll jump into grain production.
[SPEAKER_01]: The agenda, basic cultivation knowledge,
what we've learned, what we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue investigating, some harvesting,
grain handling, and then product
[SPEAKER_01]: development and challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information on this
slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the basic management practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is where we start with a lot of our
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make sure that these slides are
available to share so you guys don't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like you have to frantically write notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things I think are important
to highlight, it can be used either in
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional tillage or no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the production in our area is
no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that be really successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The probably highest risk like most crops,
but planting is where we can really either
[SPEAKER_01]: make or break the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to get the right depth and
spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timing, it definitely is more flexible
than I would say some other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go as early as late April to early
June.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen pros and cons to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the production of what you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to mitigate weed
pressure, that's your number one concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe planting earlier to try to get the
crop established earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to chase moisture,
maybe looking at the forecast a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is fairly frost-resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say trying to target that 50
degrees soil temperature though is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the best time to look at
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planting density is definitely a big thing
to work with whoever you're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: production-wise because that is what we
see play the biggest role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely depending on if you're growing
for fiber or grain purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For seed production, I would say targeting
300,000 plants per acre is a good place to
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll depend on your variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed size and hemp cross-varieties is
very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are nice round plump seeds that their
bushel weight is going to be different
[SPEAKER_01]: than some of these really smaller seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think working with your processor who's
going to be purchasing the commodity is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the most important thing to
understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then working with whoever owns the variety
to give that insight into your pounds per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right, I outlined our growth cycles
of what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the varieties are dioecious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have male and female plants coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This outlines when you'll see the males
start showing those reproductive organs
[SPEAKER_01]: first, when you'll start to see pollen
drop, and then when those seeds start to
[SPEAKER_01]: really fill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the challenges that we see
every year and it's the risk that farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: take is around harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of variables come into play because
it is an indeterminate plant, meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll just continue to put on seeds until
something kills the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see nice mature large seeds at the
bottom of the seed head, and then you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see small immature green seeds at the top
that really have no value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a thing that farmers have to
evaluate when they're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing yield is when to cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things, I think every year our
growers get more confident in their
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, mother nature has a pretty big
role to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, moisture is what we're chasing
most of the time if we're on dry land
[SPEAKER_01]: acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had a lot of success on irrigated
acres, but just for reference in our
[SPEAKER_01]: region, we're working with 10 to 12 inches
of annual precip out in Pennsylvania and
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are probably somewhere between 35
and 50 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big difference in moisture needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone thinks hemp can do all
things with limited resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is always surprising what it is
resilient to, but just like most things
[SPEAKER_01]: green, it wants water and it wants
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some biofactors and what we've
learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp definitely allows for very biodiverse
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bringing new organisms in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's helping promote that activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've definitely seen some value there on
the soil side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do see some competition with weeds
early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few chemistries that have been
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of outlined them on the side there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for our region, so I can't speak
to what everyone will have access to or
[SPEAKER_01]: see success with, but I do think it's
important to throw this on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're big fans of regenerative
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We promote that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do organic production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take a full holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think hemp is an awesome crop to
revitalize agriculture in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of its ability to be more
resilient, its reduced needs and inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what it does at the soil level,
we think there's a lot of things that can
[SPEAKER_01]: be used in a transition program for those
farmers who are looking to either go
[SPEAKER_01]: organic or regenerative, but the reality
is conventional practices are still very
[SPEAKER_01]: much needed for a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to just fit all applications and
all operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For weeds, if you can get the crop out of
the ground while established, we see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of competition happen throughout the year
and hemp usually wins out there with its
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy closure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some pests to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are definitely some aphids,
grasshoppers, caterpillars, spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's probably more in other
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, because of some of those
terpenes and cannabinoids, we think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some natural repellents that are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, the most devastating pest is
grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more due to hemp is the last thing
that guys harvest around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grasshoppers are going to be looking for
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the wheat is cut and other pulse crops
are cut, they go to the last green thing
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, which almost always ends up
being hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've definitely had our years 2020
through 2022 are pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still don't have a great solution for
that, but generally speaking, that's about
[SPEAKER_01]: all the pest pressure we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely see the pollinators like it,
especially when those males are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can walk through the fields and just
see all the bees there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that's a great thing for your
ecosystems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then some diseases to be aware of,
variety dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see some of those terpenes also playing
a role, I think, and definitely the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of the seed head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those grain varieties have tighter
seed heads that hold on to moisture a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more, don't allow for that seed
to breed, and so sometimes we can have
[SPEAKER_01]: some mildew or mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that a lot in our region,
but we definitely know of it in other
[SPEAKER_01]: places as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the things to learn to
highlight, it definitely is region
[SPEAKER_01]: specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a shocker there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that for every other commodity or
crop we're growing, but it is important to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight that hemp is behind,
obviously, by several decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the germ plasms available
and the breeding programs that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: successful, hemp just has a long way ahead
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some fantastic companies
out there doing great work making headway
[SPEAKER_01]: both in hybrid opportunities and such,
but we really need to see that increase
[SPEAKER_01]: both in just the varieties that are
available to increase yield, but region
[SPEAKER_01]: specific varieties as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think understanding what are the
important traits you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's maturity due to harvest
timing or plant height, seed head
[SPEAKER_01]: architecture, those are all things to keep
in mind when choosing variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it also is really important to talk
about what you're planning to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll play a role in what you want those
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly plant height, I think is really the
big thing to determine there, but these
[SPEAKER_01]: are all things to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked to share what varieties we've
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I'm missing a couple,
but we try to do a good job of having a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial scale plot trials out every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last year and this year, we've had
about 120 acres that we've divvy up
[SPEAKER_01]: between 10 and 20 acre plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to work with universities to
get those plot trials that are a half acre
[SPEAKER_01]: or less, but really rubber meets the road
when you start seeing these commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: size trials and seeing how these varieties
perform under the same conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: same soil type, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to give some insight for our
area of these varieties if people are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always try to have an open book,
open door policy and try to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborative as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain harvest storage and handling is
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say if not more important than that
planting risk, you can have a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and really excited about your season
and you can ruin it in one day and just a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hours if you don't handle it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, you're going to be cutting it
either with a draper header or just a
[SPEAKER_01]: classic combine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could swap it as well and then come
back with combine header.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest, I think the biggest thing to
focus on there are your settings and your
[SPEAKER_01]: combine to clean the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely know that it is high foreign
material because of that indeterminate
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be harvesting really
great, dry, beautiful seeds, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: also going to be bringing in a lot of
trash with both the bracts and the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all those immature seeds as well,
which hold on the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moisture is not your friend in this case
because that's where we see mold and other
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to our farmers about using
augers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fragile seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to peas or other things,
you can use an auger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to go slow since seeds will
crack and then that's a quality concern
[SPEAKER_01]: because of its high oil content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to want to go rinse it pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bend storage is really important to have
set up ahead of harvest to making sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: have aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are fortunate enough here in our region
that most of the time we don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our relative humidity is manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know in other areas though,
if you don't have relative humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: your favor, you need to make sure that you
have a heater on there to keep that
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being careful to keep those temperatures
down just has that low flash point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think we can give some
insight there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good rule of thumb is making sure that
if you're harvesting above 10% moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get your grain on air within
four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of a non-negotiable,
so making sure you have that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys don't have that access or are
challenged with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll actually choose to harvest,
either swath it and let it dry in the
[SPEAKER_01]: field or harvest it at much drier
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those risk is you have shatter and other
bird pressure, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lose some yield if you wait for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fundamentally, if you don't have a way to
dry your grain, you sort of don't have an
[SPEAKER_01]: option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to cut it at low moistures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then turning over your bed and making sure
you're keeping it on it for spoilage is
[SPEAKER_01]: really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a raw food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be careful and cognizant of
your truck and trailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do truck affidavits with our growers,
so making sure they get into the hoppers
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure everything's cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, hemp shoes are the last thing
they harvest, and so we're following
[SPEAKER_01]: something else, whether it's wheat or peas
or something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp typically is allergen-free,
and so it's important for us to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that at the farm level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biggest risk is wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also considered generally
gluten-free, so making sure we get all
[SPEAKER_01]: those wheat kernels out is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talked about hemp as an opportunity
for more sustainable agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, this is the four points I like
to highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, we see overall lower inputs,
everything from herbicides and pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: even to water usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are really excited about
hemp when we look at some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: aquifers drying up and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp definitely has a role to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the more we get a handle on
what its means are and what our production
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations are, and then the economies
that survive for those costing models is
[SPEAKER_01]: really important also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely know hemp is great
sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very fast-growing, and we know that
there's a lot of biomass on the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when we're growing for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with a group to be able
to articulate our carbon sequestration
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers, and then we also articulate that
in our LCAs with our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think there's a role to play in the
fight against climate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely hemp improves some
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing in a new root structure
that definitely helps with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see other pollinators and other things
coming and really helping build up a
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient ecosystem for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone in the last decade in
agriculture has realized how important it
[SPEAKER_01]: is to focus on soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from adopting no-till practices
or minimal till practices to how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: increase biologics in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important, and I think hemp's
a great crop to help complement those
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, it's a minimal waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's awesome is even when you're growing
for grain, you can really model that dual
[SPEAKER_01]: crop scenario where we can harvest for
both the grain and seed head, but also for
[SPEAKER_01]: that residual fiber and bring value.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding more and more valuable homes
for these co-products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting to see for an industry
that only has half a decade under its belt
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the US to continue to see value
opportunities for these byproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about food and feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a market survey last year to get a
feel and help point us in our direction
[SPEAKER_01]: where we want to go with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was one of the slides I took from how
currently consumers are looking at hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see that we're almost at the
50th percentile for consumers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already using these ingredients in their
diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: More room to grow, but it's a lack of
perception that everyone still thinks that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're an intoxicating product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, about 50 percent of people are
eating it in some form or fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've made progress in the last
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did take this slide from Sam
Garfinbully, the marketing officer with
[SPEAKER_01]: Tilray and Manitoba Harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give him appropriate credit,
but I thought it was a really good slide
[SPEAKER_01]: to showcase from a food perspective where
we're seeing hemp grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a wonderful brand that they've
really grown and invested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been legal in Canada about two
decades more than it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a little bit of a head start
on us and they've done a great job of
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating hemp into food, into store
shelves, and then the consumer basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutritionally, what we have and a little
bit of beyond the basics, but what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: generally speaking of from the
macronutrients is 20 to 30 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates, 10 to 15 percent of that
being in soluble fiber, somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 and 35 percent oil and 20 to 25 percent
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen this fluctuate a little bit
from varieties, but this is some good
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a really unique complete protein,
meaning it has all those nine essential
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids, but it's also encouraging as
the increased bioavailability,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what we can digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This protein composition also is pretty
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: That graph on the right there is showing
those amino acids and it's comparing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: other proteins that we probably complement
in the food space, so pea protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: soy protein, fava bean protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think albumin and Edison are probably
the most exciting ones that we see pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: unique for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think food formulators are continuing to
focus on those things to highlight that
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer basis is obviously growing in
its consumer awareness of the value of
[SPEAKER_01]: protein in its diets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're poised to be able to take advantage
of that and think hemp has a role to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also still a good source of those
plant-based polyunsaturated fats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about hemp's unique omega fatty
acid profile, that six to three ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: really ideal for absorption and
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that value proposition also showing
up in feed applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the allergens,
which is always good to have an ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also meaningful mineral
micronutrient and anti-nutrient properties
[SPEAKER_01]: as hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highlighted where I think a potential,
my background working with ADM,
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of growth in protein isolates
and protein concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as we talk about the value
proposition hemp has with protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't miss talking about isolates and
concentrates as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some great processors that
have been working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed a few here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that others are working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's conceptually just trying to isolate
those proteins or concentrate up those
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins to put it in a form that can be
used more as an ingredient versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone fully appreciates how
much soy protein is in the US consumer's
[SPEAKER_01]: diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly because we don't always look at it
in the ingredient list, but it's in a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge market base there for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that we complement pea protein
in the amino acid profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we create an ingredient and put it in
a functional form that allows us to get on
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of more labels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some examples of success you might have
heard, Elmhurst is done like TeraMeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done creamers and sour cream
alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nepra has done some meat and egg
replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Planet-based food has done some ice cream
and other milk replacements.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of great companies
that are trying to break into that
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all excited and supportive of that
because we generally all want the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want more people consuming hemp food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about feed real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't go into a lot of the processing,
but hopefully most people generally know
[SPEAKER_01]: the basic processing for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get clean seed in, you can either run
it through a press for mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, and you get hemp seed oil and
hemp cake or meal as a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you run it through a hauling system to
retrieve that healthy hemp heart,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then your hemp hulls are your
coproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both scenarios, those coproducts right
now don't have a lot of applications in
[SPEAKER_01]: human food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important for us to be looking
at alternative valuable markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not uncommon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most crops and commodities have this same
problem where not everything can go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the food market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the access to the feed market is
really important for growth of any kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the feed consumption generally
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what is the animal feed diet
consisting of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I circled soybean meal and canola meal
because that's where I think we can
[SPEAKER_01]: compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely not chasing corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to remind people we're not here
to compete against corn and soy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't us trying to take the big bad
boys out, but how can we complement the
[SPEAKER_01]: existing feed chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a huge market in terms of
process capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the infrastructure to really
compete on those volumes anyways,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we need to start working towards that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a snapshot of how many tons
of product we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really not in a space as an industry
right now to service any of these markets
[SPEAKER_01]: right now today by ourselves anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to position ourselves as a
complementary ingredient, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: from a nutritional perspective or a
pricing perspective, but making sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are very aware and demanding for
higher quality protein sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp can check that box.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an increased awareness of fatty
acid profiles and what it does for gut
[SPEAKER_01]: health and just the animal overall health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp can check that box too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have renewable resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wool and hair is one that's talked about
here for some other things, but hemp with
[SPEAKER_01]: what we can do with the fiber,
the residual fiber also helps offset some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those impacts as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hemp E Coalition is a mission-driven
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 501c3.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great members on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to highlight the great work that
they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We achieved the first successful
application for an AFCO ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who are not aware, the FDA has
two arms, a human food arm and then an
[SPEAKER_01]: animal feed arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been working with state regulators
and AFCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more restrictions on animal feed
than there are human food, mostly because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is people's livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, animals don't really have a choice
what they eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, species will eat the same
thing every day all day for their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There needs to be a lot of scrutiny and
thought put into their nutrition to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure we're putting them in the best
position possible to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it was a pretty lengthy
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took us about three and a half years,
close to $300,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be listed as an official
ingredient in the next OP.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more vote in August,
but we've passed the last five.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got one more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are states that are recognizing the
tentative ingredient definition right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did require us that we completed two
different large-scale feed studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to establish and defend a method
for cannabinoid analysis, and then we had
[SPEAKER_01]: to recommend contaminant levels for
cannabinoids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge milestone for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to highlight the laying hens
study because one is the only ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: improved, but also just the great things
that we see from hemp and why laying hens
[SPEAKER_01]: are a target species for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a breakdown of hemp seed cake
versus other feed ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the highlights from an amino
acid level.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fatty acid profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about that omega-6 to 3 ratio,
which is so important for metabolism and
[SPEAKER_01]: for inflammation responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see very competitive there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the awesome thing is that that same
correlation we saw in the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see those numbers going down as
the percent of hemp seed cake concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: was introduced in to the laying hen,
you see that omega ratio going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the bottom there is talking about
dietary health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took these slides from Dr. Raj Kusula.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of our HFC board members.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the chief scientist on this study
and so give him all the credit for the
[SPEAKER_01]: work that they did there with wanger
feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to share more, but it's encouraging
to see that value proposition that we see
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ingredient translated into the egg
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another surprising benefit we also
see was an increase in lutein content,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we should care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lutein is a critical compound that we see
playing a role with eye health.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can also bring that value
proposition to the eggs, I think consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: will be excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, this is the matrix of why we
think hemp seed meal has such a great
[SPEAKER_01]: potential as a feed ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at the nutrient profile and the
anti-nutritional factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to assess safety, its palatability.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to check for health and welfare,
making sure that there wasn't any concerns
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sourcing, processing, availability and
economics are all things we're working on
[SPEAKER_01]: as an industry because we're still pretty
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't necessarily have the economies of
scale to compete and may not have the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability that some of these production
henhouses are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all things that we continue to
chip away at as the industry grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a huge ability for us to get that
APCO approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really couldn't start opening these
doors until that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happened in August of 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, some states recognize it,
some haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really even have a foot in the door
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think once that vote happens this coming
August, that will be wide open for folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to highlight becoming an HFC
member.
[SPEAKER_01]: HFC's goal is to get more applications
submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we open up more markets
domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breakdown of membership, we do have a
great value proposition in our member
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We correlate and combine all of the
research studies that are out there and we
[SPEAKER_01]: provide an executive summary, quick access
on our member zone online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to research, you want to say,
hey, I want to look at what research is
[SPEAKER_01]: out there for hemp hauls with swine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pull that together for you and have
an executive summary and then access to
[SPEAKER_01]: any publications that might be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fundamentally, all of our funding goes to
supporting research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've written grants, we've been included
on other feed opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to hear from a couple
of folks later in other webinars about
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that are going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have to prepare the applications,
which takes time and sometimes even takes
[SPEAKER_01]: a consultant to do some safety studies for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that takes time and energy and money,
but it's so critical for the growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really can't highlight that enough just
to be able to have those markets available
[SPEAKER_01]: to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to have you participating as HFC
member.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I gave us 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For questions, I never know what people
want to hear, but you guys can obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out to me and then happy to take
questions now as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question is, what has been your
farmer's experience with no-till?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done really well with no-till up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, having the right equipment is
really imperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our guys out here have different
types of hoe drills or other drills.
[SPEAKER_01]: That work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seed to soil contact is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll have uneven emergence in
the furrow if that isn't managed well,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have too much residual from the
last crop or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, we definitely have
success with no-till operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, that answered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommendations for how to deal with bird
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, I think people say
when the birds are there, it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few creative solutions that some
farmers have come up with, with scarecrows
[SPEAKER_01]: and fire cannons and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I would say there's a
silver bullet out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pimp definitely attracts birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any avid bird hunters, I would say
it's a great crop to put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see doves in there, pheasants,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more challenging in regions that are
surrounded by shrubs or trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to New Zealand and some other
places, the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have more paddocks that are
surrounded by these trees that are full of
[SPEAKER_01]: birds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're fortunate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just the big Montana sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have thousands of acres at a time
without any interruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bird pressure is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, if you can get in and
harvest, that's the best way to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: birds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leftover plant material after we
harvest the seedhead, the question is what
[SPEAKER_01]: does IND camp do with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, we do let it rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rotting is a really important aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole nother conversation for
fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, we want to see that plant
start to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they get cut off?
[SPEAKER_01]: My back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the leftover, we will purchase
that residual straw from growers and then
[SPEAKER_01]: run it through a decortication facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost strictly straw material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that bass fiber and herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any leaf material left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, by then, it's dried up and broken
down in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strictly that stock material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd love to partner with more
researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key is starting the relationship with
FDA, CBM, and AFCO early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our ruminant application, we're going
through a pre-submission process where we
[SPEAKER_01]: basically pull together all existing
published research, review it with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then identify any gaps in the
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, with the laying hen study,
there was definitely research that was
[SPEAKER_01]: published outside of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was good research talking about
palatability and nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of the studies had really dove
into the potential cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: transference into the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was FDA's main concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to work with a private research
group with the wanger feed company and
[SPEAKER_01]: tailored that feed study to answer that
question specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that anything is great and we get
to start, but working with HFC early on
[SPEAKER_01]: and mapping out what research objectives
haven't been addressed yet is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then hopefully, we can design a protocol
to meet those things for an application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question about developing single variety
for both seed and fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't quite know what the question is,
but there definitely are varieties out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that tout that they're both a true
dual crop, which I don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: disagree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we tell our farmers is if you're
growing for seed, that is your primary
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes the most care and attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fiber residual is your by-product.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you just look at the economics of it,
it's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get 90 percent of your
revenue off of the seed harvested,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: A true dual crop model, yes, it can be
done and varieties are doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we always tell them to focus first on
the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the higher value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what needs more attention to detail
and making sure it fits your operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely collaborate with academic
researchers and universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the cuff, we're part of the FARC
consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Cornell University of Kentucky and
CCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do work with Montana State here and
then a handful of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always super excited to hear what
people are going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely don't have a pulse on
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to work with us or from
agronomy to food and feed, we would love
[SPEAKER_01]: to participate and know more about what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question about stinger listed on what not
to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try to pull up my herbicides list
real quick so I can make sure I'm telling
[SPEAKER_01]: you the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stinger is a burndown that's used for
broadleaf here in our region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just know that it's not labeled for
hemp to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spartan charge is another one that is on
the other side as we know is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: effective herbicide for a lot of
broadleafs, but there is carryover issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We follow the label very similar to canola
and some other broadleafs out here in
[SPEAKER_01]: oilseeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll follow their recommendations for
plant back periods and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not our agronomist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to talk to our agronomist,
I will put you in contact with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He definitely knows far more about what
chemistries we use and don't use and those
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anticipate approval for livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely are still, I would say,
18 to 24 months out for getting approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do some more creative
applications to see if we can group more
[SPEAKER_01]: species together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ruminant application will be large
and small ruminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waiting on some key data to be
analyzed from a land study that Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: State University did a few years ago,
but that's the last step for information
[SPEAKER_01]: before we finish that application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question about if we're developing
construction materials for hemp in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely support right now one of the
larger material construction companies in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that are doing a batten installation
replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where a lot of our bass fiber is
going to applications like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see an opportunity and hope
we're active in ASTM and other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking at hemp Crete and the
materials that are used there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm naturally a little more just measured
in my optimism as far as timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Construction is challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many regulations and approvals
that you need and we need to obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: prove its efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to put people in houses that
aren't made to last and withstand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great place for us to focus
and continue to spend research dollars and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some great companies that we
partner with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a real game changer for hemp
as a material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I covered all the questions in the
Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than diesel tractors, which parts of
the business precious use the most energy?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done an LCA of our cradle to gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially looking at our carbon
footprint as an organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest footprint is definitely on the
agronomy side in terms of fertilizer usage
[SPEAKER_01]: and like you said, fuel for any of the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inherent to all agricultural
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely can find and continue to
optimize those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding partners that are closer by to
reduce those footprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilizer is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a lot of control over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the varieties that can work,
reduce fertilizer needs, that has no real
[SPEAKER_01]: impact in our carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the facility,
it is energy intensive in terms of what
[SPEAKER_01]: our electrical usage is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air handling is probably our biggest
motors and electrical users.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a mechanical process to separate the
bast and herd from one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain is not as bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the air handling equipment
associated with cleaning the seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably where we see the biggest need and
then probably our mechanical presses after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about using industrial hemp for
cleaning the soil and air?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't speak to it in any detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally though, because we know hemp is
so good at sequestering carbon and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: plant cycle that we know photosynthesis
does some great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of how quickly it can grow and
just vigorous of a plant it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think it's doing something
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to speak out of turn,
but I think anything that we can plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: see and then reutilize for other
opportunities is awesome as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to research in New York or the
US related to rehabilitation of
[SPEAKER_01]: brownfields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad actually got us into hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a geologist and environmentalist
background, did a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_01]: brownfield sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got interested in hemp because of its
ability to fight or remediate the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been engaged with some studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did work with Idaho University looking
at lead uptake with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely see that hemp does some
great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to see where those heavy
metals, even hydrocarbons and
[SPEAKER_01]: radionucleotides end up in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does do a good job of protecting its
DNA from the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those compounds, we don't find
them in the seed themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll find residual in the stock
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Pennsylvania is really interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been looking at hemp to work with
some recovered coal mines or other things
[SPEAKER_01]: where we have soil issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with an oil company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an old abandoned oil refinery in
Northeast Montana that we've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: on for almost a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to work with them at incorporating
hemp as part of our rehabilitation and
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another awesome thing about hemp that we
hope to see grow in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I covered it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have my email if I've missed
anything, but feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really appreciate the opportunity to speak
on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I did an okay job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Morgan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an amazing talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for answering all of our
questions too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we have reported the webinar and we
will be uploading it to our School of
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrative Plant Science YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to watch it again,
if you missed some part, please go over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will upload it in the coming days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our next webinar, which is going to be
on February 12th, we are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to talk about plant
pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, thank you everyone for connecting
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see you on February 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goodbye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
