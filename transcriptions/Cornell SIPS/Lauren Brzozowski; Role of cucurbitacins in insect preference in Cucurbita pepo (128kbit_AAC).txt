[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today I'm going to be talking about the
role of cucurbitations in insect
[SPEAKER_02]: preference in cucurbit of Pippo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those who have heard me speak
before, you know that, or you may remember
[SPEAKER_02]: that I have been working for the past few
years on trying to understand the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: and biochemical basis of striped cucumber
beetle preference in cucurbit of Pippo,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like summer squash, acorn squash,
and zucchini.
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of this work has been focused on
resistance in leaf tissue, since that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue that matters the most to us here in
New York when we transplant squash into
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been looking for preference at
that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of this work has started with
looking at screen and germplasm for beetle
[SPEAKER_02]: damage and other beetle-centric bioassays
to try to understand the genetic basis of
[SPEAKER_02]: preference and also identify traits that
are responsible for beetle preference and
[SPEAKER_02]: do selection for non-preferred varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, these beetles are somewhat
challenging to work with in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have seasonally dependent behaviors
like mating and aggregation, which can
[SPEAKER_02]: really confound some results and has
unfortunately not led to a lot of gain in
[SPEAKER_02]: this regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying a few other approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the approaches I'm trying is
working with a proxy insect for these
[SPEAKER_02]: beetles that neither mate nor aggregates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm using this as a proxy for
selection for these beetles, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: using them to identify other chemical
traits and plants that impact insect
[SPEAKER_02]: preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another thing I'm doing,
which is what is going to be the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: my talk is about today, is looking at
traits in plants that we hypothesize may
[SPEAKER_02]: be important for insect preference,
genetically mapping them, creating
[SPEAKER_02]: populations with high or low of these
compounds, and then seeing how the beetles
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last part is going to be talking
about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the compound in question in the title
of my talk is cucurbitacins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start with an overview of
what cucurbitacins are, tell you about
[SPEAKER_02]: some mapping results we have, and then,
of course, talk about what this means for
[SPEAKER_02]: the striped cucumber beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cucurbitacins are intensely bitter and
toxic triterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more than 20 types of
cucurbitacins in the cucurbitaceae family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything we know about their
biosynthesis so far is from cucumber,
[SPEAKER_02]: another member of the family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the general pathway in cucumber is
that oxidosqualling, an output of the
[SPEAKER_02]: mevalonic acid pathway, is cyclized in the
cucurbita dienal by the bitter gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a number of other steps
of oxidation to create the final
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitacin product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cucumber, if plants have the
functional bitter allele, there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitacins in the cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only if the plants have the bitter
fruit or bitter leaf transcription factors
[SPEAKER_02]: is the bitter gene expressed in those
tissues and cucurbitacins that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: those tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for how cucurbitacins relate to
insects, there's kind of two main
[SPEAKER_02]: classifications of how organisms deal with
cucurbitacins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So specialist beetles, like the striped
cucumber beetle, have co-evolved of
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbits, and they actually sequester
these cucurbitacins for their own
[SPEAKER_02]: defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they love these high cucurbitacins,
whereas avoid low cucurbitacin plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, other herbivores like
spider mites and us, we find high levels
[SPEAKER_02]: toxic but are fine of lower levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna start with talking about our
mapping work in cucurbitapipo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cucurbitapipo has four types of
cucurbitacins, D, B, I, and E.
[SPEAKER_02]: B is the most abundant, and we measure it
with HPLC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's highest in the cotyledons and low in
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned earlier that much of my
previous work had been in leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything I wanna talk about for
cucurbitacins is all measuring and
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting in the cotyledons, because
that's where the competition is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then thinking about what germplasm to
use for this mapping, it's important to
[SPEAKER_02]: know that in cucurbitapipo, there are two
subspecies, pipapipo, which includes
[SPEAKER_02]: pumpkin and zucchini, and pipotexana,
which includes acorn squash and summer
[SPEAKER_02]: squash.
[SPEAKER_02]: While they look quite similar,
they're indeed from separate domestication
[SPEAKER_02]: events and quite genetically distinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know from previous work that
beetles really prefer pipapipo,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cucurbitacin cotyledons are high in
pipapipo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reverse is true in pipotexana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in knowing our two phenotypes are
aligned with population structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to make inner subspecific crosses
and evaluate these phenotypes in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we did is we made a
bi-parental population between a high
[SPEAKER_02]: cotyledon cucurbitacin parent from
pipapipo and a low cotyledon cucurbitacin
[SPEAKER_02]: parent from pipotexana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the high parents has, again,
cucurbitacin B is the highest,
[SPEAKER_02]: D, and then followed by D, E, and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expression of all of these are highly
correlated, so if you're high in B,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be high in the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it's hard to see, cucurbitacins
E and I are appreciably higher in the high
[SPEAKER_02]: parent than the low parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at 200 F2 individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We genotyped them with GBS and phenotyped
them for all four cucurbitacins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found one pretty convincing peak on
chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's an F2, we don't have a ton of
recombination in the reagents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about a 500 kilobase window that
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working to find map that further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, this is not the bitter gene
homolog that we know from cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on chromosome 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you zoom in, there's nothing close
to significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one line of evidence that the
difference that we see between these two
[SPEAKER_02]: populations is not due to the bitter
genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also developed PCR primers and Sanger
sequenced this bitter gene homolog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are no indications that the
protein product would be any different
[SPEAKER_02]: between these two parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like there is a single gene
making these different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the bitter gene that we know
so much about from cucumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, in this F2 population,
looked at the highest and lowest producing
[SPEAKER_02]: F2s with free-prime RNA-seq to see if
there are any genes expressed in this
[SPEAKER_02]: region or elsewhere that would be
responsible for this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our most differentially expressed gene
was indeed in this region on chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in Exceda reductase,
which you remember from the pathway for
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitases.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a series of oxidation steps to
make the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems plausible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is highly expressed in both the
high parents and the high F2s and not
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed in the low parent and low F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think we found possibly a single
gene that controls cucurbitase and content
[SPEAKER_02]: in cucurbitipipo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then bring this back to what the
motivation for this, what the implications
[SPEAKER_02]: for striped cucumber beetles are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll remind you, again, that there's
these two subspecies, pipo and texana.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you recall, that our high cotyledon
cucurbitase and parent was from
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitipipo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beetles love both leaves and cotyledons
from this species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we expect that the high parent is going
to have a lot of leaf and cotyledon
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reverse is true for texana.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I haven't told you yet is that leaf
cucurbitasins are low in both subspecies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned they were low.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're low across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if we try to induce cucurbitasin
defenses through herbivory by the striped
[SPEAKER_02]: cucumber beetle or other forms of
herbivory, the plant doesn't ever respond
[SPEAKER_02]: by producing more cucurbitasins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then to answer the question of what
selecting for cotyledon cucurbitasins
[SPEAKER_02]: means for striped cucumber beetles,
from the F2 population I told you about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I selected the extreme F2s and I self them
to make F2-derived F3 families,
[SPEAKER_02]: about 15 from either extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I measured damage in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So starting with cotyledons, so you can
see our high parents gets a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm not sure why that's like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's supposed to be 50 and onward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so our high parent gets a lot
of cotyledon damage and our low parent
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't, like we would expect because of
the subspecies difference and because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cucurbitasin difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we select for cotyledon
cucurbitasins, we see the same pattern for
[SPEAKER_02]: beetle damage in the high cucurbitasin F3s
and low cucurbitasin F3s, which is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we would expect based on the
evolutionary history of the beetle with
[SPEAKER_02]: this compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nice to see that this would work as a
selection strategy for defending
[SPEAKER_02]: cotyledons against beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, in leaf tissue,
so again, these are these two separate
[SPEAKER_02]: subspecies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we expect the high parent from the
preferred subspecies to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: damage compared to the low parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a few reasons why we may
believe that selecting for cotyledon
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitasins may affect leaf damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, beetles could be
attracted to the cotyledons and then move
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the leaves and damage the leaves
from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or perhaps there's other related turponoid
compounds from the biosynthetic pathway
[SPEAKER_02]: that provide a signal that attracts the
beetles to these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we don't see any difference in
leaf damage between these two selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find that leaf damage is independent
of cotyledon cucurbitasins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does control leaf damage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I measured a lot of things,
including the flow of sap, how sticky it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, and the mandibles of beetles,
leaf nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And neither of those are appreciably
different between the subspecies.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, from some of the work with the
insect proxy I was telling you about,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have some exciting results about
volatile deterrents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the non-preferred subspecies are
making progress, hopefully, in selecting
[SPEAKER_02]: with this proxy insect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, we've mapped a cucurbitasin
biosynthesis loci in cucurbitipipo and
[SPEAKER_02]: showed that low cotyledon cucurbitasins
reduces beetle damage in cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But leaf damage is independent of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I would like to thank my
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And committee, a lot of people in the
chemical ecology area, and all of my
[SPEAKER_02]: funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this is a question for me
method-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make a mapping population,
you have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just like you got eaten by a beetle
and you didn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just damage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so for this, we actually phenotyped
the cotyledon for cucurbitasting content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just cut off a cotyledon and
extracted from there, and then took DNA
[SPEAKER_02]: from the leaf tissue later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in previous mapping, work,
we have just looked at damage to leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: and then sequenced them later.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, if you are selecting
for lower cucurbitations to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: against beetles, is that going to be a
problem for other insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It very well could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But kind of like you were alluding to
actually, in New York, the striped
[SPEAKER_02]: cucumber beetle is by far our biggest pest
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have a lot of other pests
that we see as important as a striped
[SPEAKER_02]: cucumber beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be worth a trade-off in this
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to clarify for myself, the hypothesis
is that these volatiles potentially are
correlated in the parents.
So cucurbitations go with certain
volatiles in the one parent and not in the
other parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you make the mapping
population, they're uncorrelated in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I probably didn't do a great job
explaining this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cucurbitations, they're pretty
large compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are not volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other parts, like intermediate steps,
are small enough that they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: volatile compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our hypothesis for why high
cucurbitations content in the leaves could
[SPEAKER_02]: be due to some of those intermediate or
byproduct compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the volatile result I was talking
about has nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: cucurbitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems to be a separate compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So following up on that, are you going to
do any GC to look for other volatiles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, guys.
