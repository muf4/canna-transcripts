[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our topic today is actually around what a
practitioner needs to understand with
[SPEAKER_00]: regard to field safety and there's a
number of aspects to it that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just highlight to really give this subject
a solid treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to spend a lot more time on each
individual aspect but I want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: an overview of the kinds of things you
need to think of and just really go for
[SPEAKER_00]: the low-hanging fruit if you're having a
hard time getting your arms around what is
[SPEAKER_00]: field safety by the time I'm done you
should at least have a good understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things you need to have on hand to
make sure you're going to be successful
[SPEAKER_00]: should this ever come into question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you think about the intricacies
of field safety there's two components to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have field hardness that you're
likely to fall on and get hurt or you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have high traction which oftentimes leads
to what we call non-contact injuries and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get knee and ankle injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about hardness that
causing concussions and fractures and
[SPEAKER_00]: tractions that are knee and ankle
injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course what I've done here is look
around the particular issue and say what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the aspects of that hardness that
involve the soil and the grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the aspects of that traction that
involve the soil and the grass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you know the non-contact football
injury risk is one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly will come back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're worried about risk from a
perspective of hardness and traction and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the purposes of my time with you today
I'm strictly going to talk about surface
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness but I want you to understand that
there is a very sophisticated aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: safety with regard to traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in New York State we have a law now
that has been passed to protect athletes
[SPEAKER_00]: at the scholastic level from further
damages from concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law, the Concussion Management and
Awareness Act has now put into place a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of steps and methods and procedures
and diagnoses, education plans that then
[SPEAKER_00]: govern how, when and when a concussion is
suspected, how it's diagnosed,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kinds of treatments are provided,
how long you have to be away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has become a very very very important
aspect of athletics at the scholastic
[SPEAKER_00]: level and what's been fascinating to me is
in this entire act that I've read at
[SPEAKER_00]: length there's virtually nothing about
field safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing about field hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really all about sort of determining
was a concussion happening and what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing about was it caused by some sort
of malfeasance on the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm drawing your attention to this
particular act because I think it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be long that there's an aspect of
this act that's going to impact the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: manage our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like the Child Safe Playing Field
Act that is governing whether we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or not that we can't use
pesticides on school grounds, this
[SPEAKER_00]: Concussion Management Act right now it
does not have strict legislation regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: field management but it could eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a number of papers that have
looked at injury associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically done by medical
professionals, sports medicine doctors,
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemiologists, people who study sort of
spread of disease and injury and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it's related to
surveillance systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: NCAA or high school athletics has an
injury surveillance system that they look
[SPEAKER_00]: for where the injuries occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other aspect of this that's very
important is the field quality and often
[SPEAKER_00]: times there's a disconnect between the
injuries that are reported and the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this particular study published in the
American Journal of Sports Medicine in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2004 looked at 250 games over a five year
period in high school sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at natural turf which they
didn't characterize the quality of that
[SPEAKER_00]: natural turf and field turf which is a
particular brand of synthetic infilled
[SPEAKER_00]: turf where you have the fibers and the
rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't know that anything is specific
and there's some sort of controversy
[SPEAKER_00]: between the field turf people and this
study but for now it's a good indication,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use this because it's a good indication
of the things that actually will and could
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have total injuries, injury rate
per team game, you've got substantial
[SPEAKER_00]: injury and severe injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So substantial injury is you miss a couple
of games, severe injury is you miss months
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even the whole season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you look at the differences between
a natural turf system and a synthetic turf
[SPEAKER_00]: system, the first thing you'll notice is
that the synthetic turf system has a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher percentage of total injuries
occurring on synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look a little more
closely you see that the severe injury
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings on natural turf is much higher
than it is on synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you get more common injuries on
field turf and they're primarily epidermal
[SPEAKER_00]: rashes, rug burns and some muscle strains,
the concussions as we indicated a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: ago is what we are focusing on here in New
York and maybe field hardness is much more
[SPEAKER_00]: common on natural turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's where the tricky part comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's entirely possible that these fields
were in terrible shape because one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we know is if you've got grass
you're likely to have a more cushioned
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be these fields that
they're playing on may have a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of bare ground exposed which could
lead to these concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so that you wonder, oh you know
they have to worry about one surface or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other from a safety perspective,
each surface has their concerns,
[SPEAKER_00]: the concussions on the natural field and
the epidermal abrasions on the field turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why would you, well it's just a rug
burn, why is that a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rug burn is in fact a serious
wound where blood vessels can be exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: and athletes that then go into sweaty
whirlpools or sweaty weight rooms or go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the locker room and start
touching things with an open wound,
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential for MRSA, methicillin
resistant staphylococcus aureus,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of lethal fatal disease that can
happen to people that they can contract in
[SPEAKER_00]: those situations is very common where you
get a lot of these rug burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the solution to that is not
to spray the field with disinfectant
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's not the issue, the issue is
to treat the wound, keep it clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: hygiene is the primary way you avoid any
further problems from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just an overview of, because you get a
lot of questions about natural synthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an overview of this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look a little bit on
synthetic turf safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're just honing in on synthetic turf,
because I'm going to spend most of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about natural turf, but I want to
make a point here on synthetic turf,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two additional health concerns on
synthetic turf you need to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that there's been a long time
concern about the presence of chemicals in
[SPEAKER_00]: these products, lead in the paint that
they're making and lead in the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: that the synthetic turf is made out of,
and also contaminants in the rubber that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes up the infill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is the body of research done
shows done with this, and a lot of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: done by the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation has done a
[SPEAKER_00]: thorough review of this, and you can go to
the DEC website and see that report,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is mostly very in-depth,
deep, dense science that I barely can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the conclusion was that there's
minimal health effects related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals used in the synthetic turf
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other one that's real is the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: On an 80 to 85 degree bright sunny day,
temperatures on the synthetic turf system
[SPEAKER_00]: reached between 120 and 146.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this in perspective, you can fry an
egg at 152.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of safety is a serious
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you're playing on a summer day on
a synthetic turf field and someone gets
[SPEAKER_00]: injured and then has to lay on that field
waiting for assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five or ten minutes on a surface
that's 140 degrees will create first and
[SPEAKER_00]: second degree burns of the skin if they're
skin exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally what we say is synthetic turf in
northern climates is ideal for the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spring sports and the late fall sports
are good to play on these systems when the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass is no longer growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the grass starts growing in the
summer months and you know the heat is
[SPEAKER_00]: building on there, you best stay off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because water will decrease the
temperature but temperature increased back
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 90 to 120 within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heat is a serious concern with
synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're talking about hardness,
and we're going to talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness of these systems, you have to
understand the way we look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically if you look at this as a head
when it's dropped, if the surface is hard
[SPEAKER_00]: and not receiving of the weight,
the energy, the downward energy is then
[SPEAKER_00]: reverberated back into the head and this
is where the damage can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you have a softer surface
and you drop your head or fall on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, the energy in that dropping is
dispersed into the turf rather than back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the head that leads to the
concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of how a ground
could cause a concussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have very particular ways and
standardized methods, ASTM standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: for how field hardness or surface hardness
is assessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this was started many, many years ago
in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some research at Michigan State
that looked at how to determine field
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness and they borrowed some technology
from the pavement industry to see how firm
[SPEAKER_00]: the pavement is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to drop specified weight down
from a known height and measure hardness
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they adapted, turf scientists
adapted that particular method of
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring surface hardness into turf which
has then led to the F355 standard and the
[SPEAKER_00]: F1936 standard that basically tells you if
you're going to measure surface hardness,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the way you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a consistent way of doing
it so that the measurements all mean the
[SPEAKER_00]: same and then we ultimately report it and
you'll hear it oftentimes referred to as
[SPEAKER_00]: GMAX testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, GMAX testing assesses the risk of
life-threatening head injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not assess the risk of bone or
joint injuries which could occur but right
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're focusing on head injuries and so
impact testing as a concept is a weight is
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped onto the surface and the shock of
the impact is measured as negative
[SPEAKER_00]: acceleration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you drop the hammer down this tube,
this is a very sophisticated GMAX device,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 grand for something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drop it and following the method and
then the rate at which it decelerates or
[SPEAKER_00]: stops is an indication of how the energy
is transferred back into the head or the
[SPEAKER_00]: hammer and then that is reported as
gravities and the GMAX is maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: deceleration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the value, the harder the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's two ways of doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Clegg hammer was the original way that
was designed by the turf scientists to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of look at field hardness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what's not been well established in
this country and I'll show you some data
[SPEAKER_00]: from Australia in a minute is can you
correlate the drop of this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: device to the risk of head injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a different device, the GMAX testing
that follows the F1936 uses a 20 pound
[SPEAKER_00]: weight which may be more simulating what a
head would do and the shape of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: concave like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Clegg is for the natural turf but
not well correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't substitute this for the GMAX and
there's some sense of there are people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying to do it but you have to
be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the two devices that they use to
measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again this is only an accepted method
for synthetic turf and here's the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the $20,000 setup that you get
where you lift the hammer and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason this is an accepted method is it
tells you did you drop the hammer right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it moving at the right speed?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of quality controls that
this system does that you can't with the
[SPEAKER_00]: simpler Clegg hammer that I'll show you in
a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 pound missile drop from two feet,
you drop it three times and the second two
[SPEAKER_00]: readings are average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very specific way that field
hardness is tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have a synthetic turf how
often should you test it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first of all when you buy a synthetic
turf and it's new you want to do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a baseline because if the
contractor leaves the site and leaves you
[SPEAKER_00]: with a field that is already too high and
unsafe you have no recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure first of all you get it in
the spec that the field has to be built so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when a GMAX test is done at the end
it reads a number this or lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly to establish a baseline and
also to make sure you got what you paid
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then annually thereafter on heavily
used fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say heavily used fields,
wait a minute I got synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, synthetic turf wears out,
the infill moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that play lacrosse on the
synthetic turf you know that the goal
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth is constantly having the rubber
pushed away and the fibers degraded and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll often and almost always get a much
higher reading by the goal mouth than you
[SPEAKER_00]: will away from the goal mouth because the
rubber compacts or wears away and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore the surface becomes harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So annually on heavily used fields and
then if you have reports of a serious head
[SPEAKER_00]: injury and the field is implicated go
around you know immediately find someone
[SPEAKER_00]: in the private sector and there's a number
of people particularly Dr. Hummel at
[SPEAKER_00]: Hummel and Company that can go and do this
GMAX testing for you to create a body of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that you may need in a legal
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about natural turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one would argue certainly being on
natural turf on a summer day would be
[SPEAKER_00]: preferable but certainly a well maintained
grass field can be safe or a well
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained synthetic field can be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to maintain a cool season
turf field and you're worried about life
[SPEAKER_00]: liability and risk management as a school
board member in a local community here I
[SPEAKER_00]: am concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One place to start is that there is an
ASTM standard for maintaining cool season
[SPEAKER_00]: turf on athletic fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's F2060 and this is a document you
should have, you should understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should have a basic knowledge of you
know what's in here and am I following and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing my due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is number one something you should
have and also in a more plain English
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to what's involved in a safe
field that you might give to coaches and
[SPEAKER_00]: players and community members
administrators is something that the
[SPEAKER_00]: sports turf managers have developed a
foundation for safer athletic fields has a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole four or five page very in plain
English natural grass athletic fields for
[SPEAKER_00]: safety and I have the website there but
you can go to STMA.org and access this
[SPEAKER_00]: document.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you get involved in the legal end
of this process you have to sort of learn
[SPEAKER_00]: some jargon and one of the most important
parts words and jargon in field safety to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how involved you may be is the duty of
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: A duty of care is a legal obligation on an
individual organization required that they
[SPEAKER_00]: adhere to a standard of reasonable care
reasonable care.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be considered reasonable care
so get this learn this it's very generic
[SPEAKER_00]: it ought to be something you can easily
commit to doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable care or performing any acts
that could be could foreseeably harm
[SPEAKER_00]: others right are you leaving rocks exposed
on the fields it is the first element that
[SPEAKER_00]: must be established to proceed with action
and negligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's imagine an athlete is using your
field and falls and hits their head and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no grass there and someone
realizes that person's concussed and they
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to seek remediation for the
damage that might have been done to that
[SPEAKER_00]: child or adult on that field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing they're going to do when
you get a lawyer involved is their
[SPEAKER_00]: negligence and negligence could then be
established if you weren't taking
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's look at potential risks now this
is from a ciphers and beard publication
[SPEAKER_00]: from the late 90s this is one of the
foremost turf grass scientists in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop the Clegg hammer on a number of
different surfaces all right where a
[SPEAKER_00]: cement floor was as much as 1400 G's a
football outdoor four-year artificial 175
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you don't think about this but in
tennis if you fall and hit your head that
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be good basketball court that's not
going to be good baseball natural turf
[SPEAKER_00]: Bermuda grass field so you can see very
hard to softer what's not well understood
[SPEAKER_00]: and not well established in this country
is how does this correlate to head injury
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got it for the G max testing they
don't have it for the Clegg hammer yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now as we're talking about legal things
that's the kind of data that a good lawyer
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to start pulling out and so as a
school district as a member of the school
[SPEAKER_00]: board I am constantly mindful of the
management of risk in a school district
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's how a teacher manages their
classroom it's how what kind of cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: products we use to clean the bathrooms to
all the way to how the fields are kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a risk management perspective
knowing that field use would that wears
[SPEAKER_00]: out the centers of these fields often you
can see the wearing out here knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the primary ways the turf
gets less safe is do we have enough space
[SPEAKER_00]: for the amount of use that we have is the
space appropriate for the type of use for
[SPEAKER_00]: example you know here's a lacrosse field
are they going to be alright playing
[SPEAKER_00]: lacrosse on a little bit of dirt skin here
is it appropriate for that use and is the
[SPEAKER_00]: space managed properly do you have enough
room is it appropriate to play that sport
[SPEAKER_00]: there and are you managing it properly so
those are the things I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: when I'm thinking about moving further
with regard to this now one way to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your arms around this is for communities
led by the groundskeeper with a board of
[SPEAKER_00]: education or community sports people to go
out and assess the field now we developed
[SPEAKER_00]: a tool many many years ago that's very
simple for the average person to fill out
[SPEAKER_00]: if the grounds managers there that grounds
manager can answer a question about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's the field is watered how much
fertilizer they put on what the mowing
[SPEAKER_00]: height is and that's it everything else
can be answered by a lay person that might
[SPEAKER_00]: use the field and then you get a number by
answering these things so here is a Hector
[SPEAKER_00]: soccer field where we rated these numbers
and it came out with a 31 and we're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get between 21 and 35 you should
reassess your management program unless
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality you expect is less than three
but you've got a wonder from a safety
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective whether that field is at risk
so if you're over 35 you've got to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about renovating those fields if you're
under 21 you're doing pretty good so this
[SPEAKER_00]: this Travis high school football is
obviously doing pretty good so an easy way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get everybody on the same page and have
a conversation about the fields as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about risk management now no
one's going to argue that a grass field is
[SPEAKER_00]: really good when there's grass but in fact
there's data to support this it starts out
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all by understanding your soil
this is the amount of fine particles so
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go from here you're probably
talking about a high sand content all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way up to a really clay soil along the
bottom here and this is the hardness of
[SPEAKER_00]: that field alright so when you dry that
soil down right you can see without any
[SPEAKER_00]: grass cover without any grass cover as you
add more clay particles if you have a clay
[SPEAKER_00]: soil field without any grass cover you can
see how hard it gets as it dries out the
[SPEAKER_00]: more clay you add and then however when
you have a hundred percent grass cover you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see that the grass mitigates the
hardness so what's the message here well
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you really simple
things the simplest thing is if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural grass field make sure you've got
vegetation I'm going to say vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: because we think generally broadleaf weeds
are not as traffic tolerant we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some more data we've had some new
data from Tennessee that's indicating they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't hold up as well they wear out much
more quickly and that's a problem because
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to have a grass or vegetated
surface to mitigate the hardness here
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for those of you without
irrigation as the fields going to dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: more now I spent a little time in
Australia this past year and traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: around looking at sports fields and number
of conversations with the grounds industry
[SPEAKER_00]: over there and they actually have
guidelines that they've developed from a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of studies conducted in Australia
on Australian rules football fields
[SPEAKER_00]: because they play Australian rules
football which is this sort of Gaelic
[SPEAKER_00]: football rugby soccer thing if they played
on a huge field there's 17 guys on a side
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very no equipment it's shorts and
a t-shirt that's it and they've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a system using the Clegg which
we and right now in the states have not
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted but this is what they have done in
Australia where they're grading it as too
[SPEAKER_00]: low all the way to untold unsafe okay so
it's safe is between 31 and 69 the
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred range is between 70 and 89 now
they're also measuring this with related
[SPEAKER_00]: related to traction as much as field
hardness that you could hit your head on
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's probably why the preferable
range is good here and this is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: unsafe because the traction is probably
really bad it's too soft so you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: field that's too soft and you see that
with muddy fields an ideal field and a
[SPEAKER_00]: field that's too hard all right again we
have not adopted this but these are good
[SPEAKER_00]: values to just sort of start with now if
we can agree that grass is good and just
[SPEAKER_00]: having this soil covered is good then
we've got to think about how to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: that cover because overuse will result in
failure so what we want to do if that fail
[SPEAKER_00]: point is usually you know over here we
want to move that fail point further over
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the turf can sustain itself longer
and one of the things we've done with this
[SPEAKER_00]: is some of our work with intense over
seeding where we're over seeding on a
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly basis during the traffic period
light frequent amounts of seed thrown on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis to maintain turf cover where
normally the traffic would wear out the
[SPEAKER_00]: turf to this so you're talking about is
this safer than this I can't say
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically but in general we know the
more grass you have the safer that field
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be so here's the study we did
we took this field we mowed it at three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches we traffic the equivalent of five
games between the 20 and between the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: mark so lots of traffic there was no water
we watered we fertilized twice a year we
[SPEAKER_00]: use the drop spreader because the soil is
exposed from the traffic so you to get
[SPEAKER_00]: good soil seed contact under high traffic
you don't have to slit seed in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: several studies have shown slit seeding
makes it worse because let's see such a
[SPEAKER_00]: dig things up and then you've got ryegrass
bluegrass and tall fescue now is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: two pieces of data that I'm going to show
you we did this over a three-year period
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rainfall amount in the first year
was 20% below normal so here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment two four eight and or ten pounds
of seed per thousand this is turf density
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% turf density which means the grass is
not very much 85% means you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more grass and then in a dry year weed
density you didn't see a big difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of weeds that invaded because
there was no water for the weeds to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: we looked at turf quality which I'm not
going to worry about and we look at gmax
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm not necessarily going to talk
about but essentially you notice as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: from 20% turf cover at 130 gmax down to
85% turf cover at 55 that the turf gets
[SPEAKER_00]: softer now this was true for both
perennial ryegrass and for tall fescue
[SPEAKER_00]: this did not work for Kentucky bluegrass
because it takes much longer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kentucky bluegrass seed to germinate so
fast germinating plants like perennial rye
[SPEAKER_00]: and tall fescue will work fine now the
second two years of the study did the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same thing but we got regular
rainfall matter of fact above average
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall and what you see is because of
the traffic without any seeding there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: turf left lots of weeds no turf just a
little bit of seed two pounds per thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: per week gave us 85% gave us 85% turf
density and did a really good job of
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling weeds turf quality was
excellent and field firmness or field
[SPEAKER_00]: hardness was much lower so when you have
if there's going to be rainfall you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to irrigate as little as two
pounds of seed can be enough to turn a
[SPEAKER_00]: field from a disaster into a safer field
because I can tell you if a kid gets hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: on a field that looks like this they're
going to come after someone for reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: care so let's look at this if you're
looking at an American football field
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at between the hash marks
and between the 20 yard line that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the traffic in an American football
field occurs between the 20s and between
[SPEAKER_00]: the hash marks that's your high traffic
area let's go through the economics people
[SPEAKER_00]: say oh my god throw seed every week how
you gonna do that well let's go to the two
[SPEAKER_00]: pound rate per thousand so let's say we're
putting out two pounds per thousand assume
[SPEAKER_00]: a dollar twenty five per pound some people
can get it cheaper so that's a weekly cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of two dollars and fifty cents a thousand
that area between the 20s between the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: is 16,000 square feet so assuming these
seed rates cost of seed weekly cost per
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand multiplied by the area that
you're going to treat it's $40 a week for
[SPEAKER_00]: seed let's say you did it 13 weeks in the
fall and 13 weeks in the spring soccer or
[SPEAKER_00]: football in the fall lacrosse in the
spring that's 26 weeks it'd be a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in seed costs so it's not a burden
for most even small school districts like
[SPEAKER_00]: mine could afford a thousand dollars for
seed now here's an example of a trial we
[SPEAKER_00]: did in the Albany area Dave Chinery our
extension faculty in the capital district
[SPEAKER_00]: has done a lot of work with this
repetitive overseeding and this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: his trials where they had played football
played football on it did the overseeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and then left it for the next year they
didn't do it again and you can see in
[SPEAKER_00]: these plots where they over seeded and
where they didn't where they didn't this
[SPEAKER_00]: is loaded with crabgrass and where they
did there's very little weeds growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: there at all so obviously there can be
some weed control associated with that now
[SPEAKER_00]: another way to get a safe field especially
if you're you know really in a pinch and
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get that field in shape really
quickly which what the professional
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes do and there's a shot at a
professional stadium with the installation
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we call thick cut sod where
normally sod would be cut between a half
[SPEAKER_00]: and three-quarters of an inch here you're
talking about an inch and a half to two
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of soil underneath so it's a very
very heavy sod so that when you lay it you
[SPEAKER_00]: can play right on it immediately because
it won't move well people say oh how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: do that well thick cut sod is roughly 60
cents a square foot your goal mouth area
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bare here is roughly 10 by 10 right
60 cents a square foot by a hundred square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot goal mouth area $60 and you could do
it a number of times that it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be safe for those athletes there
so many people have started to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: this because we know that having grass is
the key the first step to making that
[SPEAKER_00]: field safer I'll turn your attention back
to this standard that this is the minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: that you should be doing you got to get
your hands on this and understand what's
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in it and then simply focus on
keeping the use to a level you can manage
[SPEAKER_00]: and then try innovative things like the
regular overseeing to keep that grass in
[SPEAKER_00]: place because that natural turf surface
that has the grass on it is always going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a safer surface in general than bare
soil and then the synthetic and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: turf debate is going to continue with no
real clear answers until we get our arms
[SPEAKER_00]: around exactly how we can use the CLEG
values in natural turf so I hope I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit of an overview of this
particular topic I know you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot more time to discuss this over
the course of the day and thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: time this has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu you you
