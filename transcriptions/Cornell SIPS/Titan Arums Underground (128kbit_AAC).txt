[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to find out if we can go
down easier or harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to have a look in there,
you can see the old, where the,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is how big the leaf, to give you some
idea, that's how big the leaf was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you're seeing in there is
basically, that's the actual corn right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see any bud coming up yet,
which is a good sign that probably means
[SPEAKER_02]: this will be a little dormant a little bit
longer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and that's a good, it's definitely a
lot.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Found buried in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had feared this was lost and it,
it had gone into the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We planted this on August 11th,
2013 and it was weighed on June 1st of
[SPEAKER_02]: 2013 and it weighed 18 pounds,
which is very good because I'm expecting
[SPEAKER_02]: this to weigh a lot more based on how big
the arrowhead was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very exciting.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost feel like an archeologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: What blows it back to me is, so what do
you think of all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you had just about a week out
through the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty compressed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this could weigh more than the
other one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a massive corn and we have
a good scale downstairs at Andy and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tested yesterday that from the top,
the roots come from the top of the corn
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, and then they go around and go
down and grow around the corn as the corn
[SPEAKER_02]: gets converted to energy to put the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's necessary to plant them several
inches down because if you don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots will sort of go up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this may not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my punch actually is that this may not
be a flower because do you see the bud is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is on the periphery, which may mean that
this won't flower, which is good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good because when it does flower,
it'll be a really good, a huge specimen
[SPEAKER_02]: because I, um, yeah, I mean, guess that
this way it's about 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see all these roots that are coming
off the top of the corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I'm actually really,
really pleased as the health of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's always, you're never quite
sure what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy knows this as a potato grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you, uh, you just don't know
what it looks like till you dig it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's impressive how it sort of
recessed the area where the bud
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiates from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's different about Titan that,
that compared to some other Arons is it
[SPEAKER_02]: really rarely produces what I would call a
corn lit, a smaller corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other species like Conject would have
quite a number of smaller corn arms in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that you could grow up if you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, aside from leaf cutting,
the way to propagate Titan seems to be
[SPEAKER_02]: received.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember correctly reading it in one of
these articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually was saying, correct me if I'm
wrong or look this up, but he was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting one of the, uh, uh, leaflets,
you know, this is actually a single leaf,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was cutting it right here where it
was first compounded and rooting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then eventually what happens is a
little bit of a form to develop around the
[SPEAKER_02]: base of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is possible to do these leaf
cutting, but, uh, we haven't, we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: done that here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I mean, I think at this
point, if we weigh it and maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't think there's more than
a pound of media that we're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: weighed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I weighed Weed Stinky,
it actually weighed 51 pounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I had about this much or maybe a
little more chromics on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just sort of rounded it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was saying earlier, Peg, you know,
the, the petiole on this was, was much,
[SPEAKER_02]: had a much wider diameter than the last
arrowhead, the last vegetative state of
[SPEAKER_02]: our flowering Titan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was when I was really excited
about the fact that we had obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: another strong specimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the actual diameter of the petiole
was, was found here and you can see right
[SPEAKER_02]: along the edge of the plant where that
water, the edge of this location where
[SPEAKER_02]: that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we take this down?
[SPEAKER_02]: One, two,
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was about 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to half a meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a decent size.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our Dutch interns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he really knows, uh, geobytes pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were seeing a lily that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going to go find out how much it
weighs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're measuring in pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 55.9 pounds, including a little bit of
media, but not too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say that we're at least 55.
[SPEAKER_02]: The corn would probably, I haven't
actually paid attention to these things
[SPEAKER_02]: over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wouldn't be surprised if the form
weight decreases for a little while as it,
[SPEAKER_02]: as it desiccates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so based on flower on the weight,
it's, it's a, it is a blooming size form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I'm really excited now to see
whether this does based on where,
[SPEAKER_02]: where I see the new bud emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hypothesis is that it will be a
vegetative stage, which is also
[SPEAKER_02]: encouraging because that means that the
net when it doesn't have a really large.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Yeah.
