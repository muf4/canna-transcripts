[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're logged in to the second of 12 Berry
Soil Nutrient Management webinars
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsored by the Northeast Sustainable
Research and Education Program,
[SPEAKER_02]: better known as Northeast SARE,
and hosted by the Cornell University
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Horticulture and Cornell
Cooperative Extension.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Kathy Heidenreich, and I will
be your moderator for this webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to remind you, I will take a
short tour, that if you have questions or
[SPEAKER_02]: comments, you can type them into the chat
box at the bottom of the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Push the little bubble to enter those,
and we'll be sending those onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: presenter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, you were able to comment,
at least visually, up above.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little man with his hand raised,
and there's several options for
[SPEAKER_02]: communicating up there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point out to you that we have
added some materials from Ms. Janet
[SPEAKER_02]: Fallon, our speaker today, in the files
download box in the bottom right-hand
[SPEAKER_02]: corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see a 2.4 sampling PDF that's for
soil sampling, and you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_02]: download that and have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we've added, over in the bottom
left-hand corner, in the web links box,
[SPEAKER_02]: Agro One Soils Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the lab that Janet is with,
and that will take you to their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't completed the demographics
questionnaire or the educator pre-test,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are also available for download,
and you can return them to me by email at
[SPEAKER_02]: mcm4 at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me introduce our speaker,
and we'll get started with today's
[SPEAKER_02]: webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our speaker is Ms. Janet Fallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a certified crop advisor with Dairy
One, Agro One.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a 1976 Cornell grad with a degree in
plant science, and she is a certified crop
[SPEAKER_02]: advisor in the Northeast region in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an active board member with the
Northeast region certified crop advisor
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet worked for Agway in the crops
research group and Agway Farms Seed for 26
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She worked on their manure management
programs, vegetable variety trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch management, hay, and silage
additives, and forage and soybean variety
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: She joined Dairy One at the lab in Ithaca
in 2003 and provides sales and technical
[SPEAKER_02]: support, and she and her husband reside in
Tully, New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has two grown children, a daughter,
Sarah, a Cornell grad who's doing biofuels
[SPEAKER_02]: research at Arizona State University and a
son, Daniel, who is a Spanish teacher at
[SPEAKER_02]: Casanovia Central School in Central New
York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet, we're looking forward to hearing
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm right here, Kathy, and thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume I should get started now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank the group for inviting
me to participate in this soil management
[SPEAKER_01]: for berry crops webinar, and today the
topic will be specifically on sampling
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures and soil test options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to give you just a little bit
more background, though, about Dairy One
[SPEAKER_01]: and the relationship that we have with
Cornell and Agro One.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you probably know who we are,
and just in case you don't, we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: many of you might know us as the former
Dairy Herd Improvement Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do milk testing and record services for
dairy farmers throughout the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also provide herd management software
and installation services.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in the part of the business that
deals with forage analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably one of the biggest forage
labs in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover all 50 states and 37 foreign
countries as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And several years ago we got into the
realm of soil testing and more recently
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do water and manure analysis for
customers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agro One, you might wonder, you know,
with all this dairy influence,
[SPEAKER_01]: how does Agro One fit into there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in 2009, many of you are aware that
the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Laboratory
[SPEAKER_01]: basically discontinued their commercial
soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They joined strength with Dairy One.
[SPEAKER_01]: To provide soil and plant tissue analysis
services to New York homeowners,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, and farm advisors in this new
venture called Agro One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Cornell Nutrient Analysis Lab
continues to conduct research samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also provide the heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still assemble and sell the pH test
kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They conduct particle size analysis and a
number of other tests as well there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also responsible for the nutrient
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as part of the Agro One agreement,
we do the chemical analysis, but Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: still generates the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new lab director, Mike Rutzke,
acts as the primary liaison between
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell and Dairy One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve Reiners is the primary liaison
for the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a very close working
relationship with the folks at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who are joining us,
joining us from New York and you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more clarification about who's
responsible for what.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I already mentioned, Dairy One or Agro
One, which I will probably use a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit interchangeably, we're responsible for
the routine chemical analysis of soils and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're responsible for billing and accounts
with customers, the report formats,
[SPEAKER_01]: the delivery vehicles, whether it's email
or fax or searchable database,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also responsible for if somebody's
looking for a report or they have some
[SPEAKER_01]: unexpected results and they have some
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The county offices are very important
because they're sort of the first level of
[SPEAKER_01]: contact for that customer in New York
State if they need some assistance
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreting the recommendations,
as always.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it's always been and will
continue to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also the go-to part of Cornell if
a customer has general crop management
[SPEAKER_01]: questions or needs assistance,
for example, with identifying soil series
[SPEAKER_01]: names that you need for recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: CNEL or the Cornell Lab, they're
responsible for overall soil testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tissue testing procedures,
general questions or comments about the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient guidelines, any of the
specialized tests like heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also for providing access to the
commodity experts if the county offices
[SPEAKER_01]: need additional assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also at AGRA-1 work very closely with
the Cornell Soil Health Lab, and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: you from outside of New York State are
probably familiar with Bob Schindlbeck and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Soil Health Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking at taking a more holistic
approach to soil health and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical, physical, and biological health
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you probably know, we're doing the
chemical analysis, but Cornell will be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the physical and biological
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this list on this page shows many of
the components that Cornell is looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: in physical and biological health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, AGRA-1 is responsible for the
chemical analysis as part of that program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing that most of you,
if you're working with berry crops here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast or in the U.S., you
certainly understand the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize if a lot of this is a
readout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those of you who maybe aren't as
familiar with soil testing, I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: review, as they asked me to, to review
some of the important parts of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling and soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all know that it's a very
important crop management tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to have that tool to know
how much lime and fertilizer to apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: get optimum crop yield and quality,
and to avoid costly over or under
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilization of that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also important from an
environmental perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some of our crop commodities,
especially in the dairy end of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: a regular soil testing program is a
requirement of many of the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: management planning efforts in most
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when it comes to soil sampling and
analysis, I'm going to be covering a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of different topics, including
establishing a sampling schedule,
[SPEAKER_01]: using the right tools, including the
probes, the pails, the containers and
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wouldn't think that would be all
that important, but you might learn a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of things about even the sample
containers that you didn't know before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sampling technique, I'll cover where to
sample, how many subsamples, sample depth,
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing the sample for shipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll do a very brief discussion
of soil test options, whether it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: routine or diagnostic purposes,
and some of the different analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: options because there are a lot of
different soil test procedures out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the ones that are listed
here, there's actually a few others than
[SPEAKER_01]: this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll touch briefly on interpretation
and follow-up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most important part of this
whole puzzle when it comes to soil testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil fertility for any crop is getting
the soil pH to the right level for optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: crop performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with most fruits and vegetables,
most crops in general, that optimum range
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the pH range of 6 to 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with berries in particular,
blueberries have some different
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blueberries in particular, if you look at
the general requirements for berries,
[SPEAKER_01]: most berries, I think pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just say if it's a good alfalfa
soil, it's going to be good for
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the berry crops, they need a
well-drained sandy loam soil, ideally,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a pH in that 6-2 to 6-8 range,
organic matter somewhere above 3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for blueberries, as I've already
alluded to, that's a crop that operates
[SPEAKER_01]: best at a pH between 4.2 and 4.8,
which is much more acidic than other berry
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also tends to do well at slightly higher
organic matters and can perform very well
[SPEAKER_01]: even with low phosphorus availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that certainly is an important
distinction to make and it can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: crop specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with anything else, whether we're
talking manure or forage or soil or milk,
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling technique is probably the most
important part of the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a crummy sample, you're going
to get crummy results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, very important to take time
to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spend your money effectively because
that's going to determine the accuracy and
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatability of that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a perennial crop like berries,
you need to get that done properly upfront
[SPEAKER_01]: before you get the crop planted because
that will be your last shot for a number
[SPEAKER_01]: of years to make any major adjustments in
pH or soil nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it will help you ultimately
avoid very costly over or under
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all very important
considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we want to establish a sampling
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously the best time to do this is
sample before the crop goes in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it always amazes me, whether it's
seed or fertilizer or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many panic questions you get after
somebody, they put something in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, they don't have very good results,
and then they call wondering what they can
[SPEAKER_01]: do because they didn't check the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't check the fertility on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get that sample for berries,
especially with blueberries, at least a
[SPEAKER_01]: year ahead of planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of other berries,
probably 6 to 12 months is a good idea as
[SPEAKER_01]: well because you have to allow enough time
for added lime or sulfur to react with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to get that pH down to the desired
range within the whole rooting zone of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, typically recommend
with perennial crops to be sampling every
[SPEAKER_01]: two to three years or as needed for
troubleshooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, though, with any kind of fruit,
we couple the soil sampling with plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue analysis because we need to know
what's in the soil and what's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very useful diagnostic when
it comes to determining fertilizer needs
[SPEAKER_01]: for the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can also be helpful if you're using
a cover crop between rows to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're meeting the needs of that
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as time of the year,
I guess I would just say that spring or
[SPEAKER_01]: fall is probably the most logical time of
year to sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you pick a time, stick with it so
that you're sampling at the same time in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, consider that fall is the most
reliable time of year, primarily for soil
[SPEAKER_01]: pH determination because the soil is a
little bit moister and changes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer because of moisture drying out can
result in a temporary decrease in soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sampling in the summertime,
typically, it can be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: misleading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just make sure that you get that sample
in enough time so that you can make the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper adjustments needed to get that pH
increased or decreased as the soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet, we have a question from Laura.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just received a question about
buffered or unbuffered CCE tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: CEC tests for pre-plant soil tests for
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you help her make a recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cation exchange capacity, is that what
she's asking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should they indicate they want the
buffered or the unbuffered test for
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-plant blueberries?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I would have to defer that
question to Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marvin, because I'm not a fruit
specialist, per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't do any, we don't provide
cation exchange capacity as part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dairy one, the MALIC-3 packages,
you can get a cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the CEC testing currently for the
Cornell packages would be done at CNEL
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is a different procedure than
the procedure used with MALIC-3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'll make note of that,
and if you can keep track of who asked the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, we can make sure we can get back
to her with an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I couldn't help you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now back to some of the tools of the
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly there are a lot of different
tools out there for sampling soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wish I could say that there's one
tool that's better than another,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sometimes the answer to that is,
well, it depends on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the soil conditions and the
soil types, and you might actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing a lot of soil sampling,
you might want to have several of these in
[SPEAKER_01]: your arsenal of tools, and I will review
them real quickly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically we would suggest that you use a
stainless steel probe or a stainless steel
[SPEAKER_01]: auger for best results.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using something that's going to
get rusty, then that rust can be,
[SPEAKER_01]: that iron contamination can be an issue
with some of those homemade probes,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in high pH areas, and we
typically don't see many of those issues
[SPEAKER_01]: here in New York, but in some of the
western states, I know iron chlorosis is a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem on crops like soybeans and other
crops as well, and iron contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: could give you a false high reading of
iron when you actually could be deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why using a stainless steel
probe is a better idea, and likewise,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're mixing samples in a bucket out
in the field or in the garage,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, don't use a galvanized pail
because that can contaminate the sample
[SPEAKER_01]: with zinc, so it's best to use a clean
plastic bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've already mentioned that there are
probes and there's augers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think most of you are probably
familiar with using the slit-sided augers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's doing a lot of soil sampling
would probably agree that using one that
[SPEAKER_01]: also has a foot peg on it is a lot easier
on your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're only doing an occasional sample
here or there, then that foot peg isn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: critical, but certainly it will save your
back a lot of aggravation if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of sampling, and it's also going to
be faster in good conditions, but it works
[SPEAKER_01]: the best in a dry soil with few rocks,
and where I live, we have a lot of rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: that can plug it up, and also in very wet
soils, that type of a probe will just push
[SPEAKER_01]: the sample down and it doesn't go up into
the tube, so that can be a consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an auger is probably a better choice on
rocky soils or on eroded knolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lot of, like, shale-y rocks,
flat rocks, they tend to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: troublesome, or wet soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with wet soils, you'll have some
of the soil sticking to the flights on the
[SPEAKER_01]: auger, but it'll still work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use a power drill if you're
doing a lot of samples, and you can put a
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic container, like a food container
with a hole in the middle, around the
[SPEAKER_01]: auger so that the soil will fall back into
that container as it pulls the soil out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll help considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use shovels or spades for
occasional use or in the home garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you need to trim it so you're just
getting, like, a one-inch cord on the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, a wedge-shaped sample isn't
going to be representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get, you know,
maybe too much of the upper surface is
[SPEAKER_01]: represented, and it's a lot slower and
more difficult to get a good sample,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just not practical in most cases if
you're doing a lot of sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're starting to see a
lot more of the automatic samplers used by
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the crop advisors, and they're
gaining in popularity in areas where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using precision agriculture and
maybe they're using variable rate
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hand probes are probably still best
for shallow samples, but I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: these automatic samplers can be very good
in untilled sites and also for deep
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be very good as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably see more of those out in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something I learned when I was putting
this presentation together, I've used PAM
[SPEAKER_01]: or silicone sprays on our forage probe on
the outside of the probe to make it easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that probe in and out of a bale of
hay or a bunk silo, but you can also use
[SPEAKER_01]: them in soil test probes on the inside,
on the outside of the probe so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can prevent plugging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only situation where you wouldn't
want to use something like PAM or WD-40 or
[SPEAKER_01]: a silicone spray is if you are doing a
diagnostic sample for a suspected
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for your run-of-the-mill normal
routine soil test, research shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay to use these types of products
to help prevent sticking.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different places where
you can order a soil test probe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even get one on eBay or Amazon
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think most people are familiar,
if you're doing any serious soil testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil sampling, Oak Field Apparatus is one
that they have a very comprehensive
[SPEAKER_01]: assortment of soil samplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemplers, Grangers, you know, they
typically handle Oak Field and other soil
[SPEAKER_01]: samplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben Meadows is another supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can spend anywhere from $50 up to
$1,000 for a standard soil test probe or a
[SPEAKER_01]: kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, a lot of it depends on your
personal preference and how much you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be using it for your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard for me to say which unit will
be best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not sure, I guess I would
start on the low end and work your way up
[SPEAKER_01]: if you decide you need something with more
bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we get down to actual sampling
strategies, I think just common sense
[SPEAKER_01]: would tell you that the more subsamples
you take, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, we recommend taking samples
in a somewhat random zigzag pattern in
[SPEAKER_01]: each management area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your berry, the area that you're
planting is less than two acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably eight to 10 subsamples in that
two acre area would be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're larger than two acres,
I would suggest 10 to 20 subsamples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more subsamples is always going to be
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with some crops, usually in larger
fields, some consultants are doing grid
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling for this precision agriculture
and using those automatic samplers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can be very expensive when it's
done properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you'd get one sample per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically, I think most people are
doing maybe one sample for every four to
[SPEAKER_01]: five acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, you might be doing a
directed sampling based on the topography
[SPEAKER_01]: of a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this picture, you can see an eroded
spot up on the top left of the figure or a
[SPEAKER_01]: low spot down on the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to take separate samples
from the main area compared to an eroded
[SPEAKER_01]: spot or a low spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're troubleshooting, you'll be
taking a targeted sample from the bad area
[SPEAKER_01]: and a targeted sample from a good area
just to help you further pin down where
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And along those lines, with directed
sampling, you want to avoid unusual areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid the dead furrows, farm lanes,
old hedgerows, old manure piles,
[SPEAKER_01]: wet areas, severely eroded areas,
unless you're going to sample them
[SPEAKER_01]: separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, take separate
samples from areas that vary greatly in
[SPEAKER_01]: either the slope or texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or crop history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, just like with forage
sampling, you want to sample each lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hay differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to sample each management area
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be fertilizing it
differently or there's a different crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you have a suspected nutrient
imbalance in that area, sample it
[SPEAKER_01]: separately from the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've already alluded to this routine
versus diagnostic sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: With routine soil analysis, you're going
to be looking at Lyman fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations for establishment or
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you would be doing,
you know, if you don't have any specific
[SPEAKER_01]: problems or suspected imbalances,
just routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: For diagnostic analysis, you might want to
also add soluble salts to the standard
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some crops, if they have a high boron
requirement, you might also want to add
[SPEAKER_01]: the hot water soluble boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example to the standard package.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I also mentioned previously,
use paired samples from good and bad
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with berries, also if you're doing
some troubleshooting, use a plant tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis in conjunction with soil testing
to further assist with any troubleshooting
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts that you might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because something's in the ground
doesn't mean it's getting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also is where the soil health
evaluations can be very helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's looking at compaction and
also biological issues and many other
[SPEAKER_01]: physical characteristics of a soil that
might impact the ability of the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually take up the nutrients,
even if they are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sampling to the proper depth, certainly
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin Pritz said that, you know,
with most berry crops, a surface to 8-inch
[SPEAKER_01]: depth is adequate, because the rooting
depth of most berries would be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: area, 0 to 8 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get that ahead of planting so you can plow
down and incorporate needed lime,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, or nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing for established stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sample down to that 8-inch depth,
but use it along with the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Marvin did mention that if you had a
suspected problem and you needed to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper sample, you just need to specify on
the sample information sheet that let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say you're sampling it at 8- to 16-inch
depth, because that certainly would be
[SPEAKER_01]: useful in interpreting that information
and using it to modify your
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not a routine requirement for
berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're out in the field taking
those samples, you want to discard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have any grassy mat of,
you know, decaying plant material on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the core, discard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discard the soil below 8 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put it in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it completely in a clean plastic
bucket or bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that we get an awful lot of
samples in it, agro one, that are taken
[SPEAKER_01]: when the soils are really too wet to be
sampled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it very difficult to mix those
subsamples up uniformly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably are going to have to air
dry those samples if you want to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed well and get a good composite
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really, if you can avoid
sampling under extremely wet soil
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, it's probably a good idea for
a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also are leaky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some changes in some
nutrients, primarily when you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: the, like, PSNT, the samples, the nitrogen
can change very quickly, especially in wet
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really is not conducive to getting
a good mix of all those subsamples.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have your sample all air dried
and mixed up, another very important part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the process is to complete the sample
information sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fill in all of the required information,
whether it's a soil name, the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage class, depending on what state
you're from and what they require,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the billing information,
who gets copies, whether you want it faxed
[SPEAKER_01]: or emailed, make sure you get all that
information filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep a copy for your own records,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be invaluable if you are looking
for reports later, if for whatever reason
[SPEAKER_01]: you lost your copy or you didn't get it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes tracking it down that much
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when all is said and done,
we only need about two quarters to one
[SPEAKER_01]: pint of a mixed sample, whether it's in a
box or a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's roughly two cups of sample or
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually only going to analyze about
two grams of that sample when all is said
[SPEAKER_01]: and done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet, we have a sampling question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff would like to know what you would
suggest as a sampling procedure when
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are using drip tape for
fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drip tape for fertigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously you don't want to be
sampling through the drip tape,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I guess you would need to get between
the rows and just stay in that zigzag
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern if at all possible and get as
close to row centers as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't worked with drip tape,
so I guess, Jeff, if you have any
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions on that, I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sampled in that kind of a
situation, but you still need to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: area where the roots are going to be able
to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how far apart are those drip tapes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I should have asked that right up
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cathy, do you have an answer to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would vary from crop to crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might only be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It typically would run down the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: The center?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I would just say that,
you know, obviously avoid those areas
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't want to damage the tape,
and also nutrients might be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more concentrated there and not
representative of what the whole rooting
[SPEAKER_01]: zone would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be sort of like sampling under
the drip line of trees, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to get in, try and get
samples in the area where the crop is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to be drawing its nutrients
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about all I can suggest on that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a note on that as well and see
if Marvin has any suggestions on sampling
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to move on here because we still
have a fair amount to cover here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're getting the samples ready,
you know, that you've got it all mixed up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're ready to put it in the sample bag
or box, one thing that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't aware of is that you really should,
if possible, use a bag or box provided by
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab and avoid commercial paper bags or
paper boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that the glue
in many paper bags and also just the
[SPEAKER_01]: processing of cardboard, there may
actually be some boron used in the glue
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the treatment of that cardboard,
and it can alter the results, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: if the sample is wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing a boron sensitive
crop, you could get an artificially high
[SPEAKER_01]: reading if you're using a commercial bag
or box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that a lot of us in
the soil testing industry learned the hard
[SPEAKER_01]: way many years ago, but a lot of customers
still are not aware of that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already mentioned how important the
paperwork is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a pointer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of the fruit form.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the AirGrow 1 samples, we have an F
form for fruits, a V form for vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: A is field crops, H is the home garden,
and T is for turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: On all of these, except for homeowner,
there is, I'm trying to get an arrow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the middle where it says
soil information or soil name,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to get recommendations in New
York, you have, there's that arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I move it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me back up here, getting ahead of
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under soil name, it's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: With everything except for the home sample
sheet, you must provide a valid soil name
[SPEAKER_01]: or you will not get recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people who have been farming for
any length of time, they know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the maps of their fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what the soil names are.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Vermont, we need to have a soil
drainage class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the homeowner samples,
you need to provide some information on
[SPEAKER_01]: soil texture and soil drainage in order to
get those recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also need to fill in on the various
crops, the cropping history, and what your
[SPEAKER_01]: future crops will be on the vegetable
forms and on the field crop forms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can get multiple year
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to read this
carefully and provide all of the required
[SPEAKER_01]: information if you want to get the report
back the way you expect it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill it in legibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know where to find your
soil series name, and this is useful
[SPEAKER_01]: information whether you're in other states
that don't require a soil name for
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a web soil survey.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link is provided on our forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at item number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Web soil survey is an NRCS website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can figure it out, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just type in an address and zoom
in on a specific field and create a box
[SPEAKER_01]: and tell it to map it, and it will
literally map all the different soil types
[SPEAKER_01]: in a specific field or area and provide
you with some information on the
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of those soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also an app for iPhones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see I have that here twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: For iPhones and Droids, it's from
California, actually, from UC Davis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is an NRCS-based app that you can
put on your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's geo-referenced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're standing out in a field
somewhere, you just click on that app and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll get you the soil name and the
characteristics for the spot where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another very useful tool that's available
for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest you try that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, that web soil survey,
if you do use that, this map is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit hard to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will come up with a map with faint
yellow lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the codes of the
various soil types within each soil unit
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll give you a legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's additional information on that
web soil survey site as well as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of that particular soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, there's, you know,
a lot of fields have more than one soil
[SPEAKER_01]: type.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing here is that this will give
you the acres of each soil type within the
[SPEAKER_01]: area that you had the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just list the one that's the primary
soil type in that field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a Palmyra grab, heavily silt
loam, for example, all we need is Palmyra.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need the descriptors at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the soil series name is sufficient to
get those recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes time for shipping
and handling, check with the lab that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with to see what the
options are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with us, we already have
a built-in system of pickup points for our
[SPEAKER_01]: milk samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever there's cows, there's going to be
pickup points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on our website, you can go to this map
and click on the location nearest to you
[SPEAKER_01]: and find out the address and the days and
the time that samples are picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, it's three times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no charge for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can ship those samples free of
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you can ship them by U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: mail, FedEx, UPS, whatever is going to be
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for things like PSNT that are a little
bit more time sensitive, I'd suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: mailing early in the week so that they
don't sit in a post office somewhere for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days losing time and getting
warm and changing in their analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically it in terms of
sampling and shipping and handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just some general guidelines which would
fit whether you're working with AgriOne or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with a university lab or
another commercial lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so field sampling is field sampling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we get down to extraction and
chemical analysis, there are quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to understand the
differences because there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often tempting to compare the results
from one lab to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not always a good idea because
chances are very good they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: different extraction techniques and the
numbers aren't going to be comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the relative ranges are,
but the extraction results or the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: can be very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just makes that rather difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically how do these labs differ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, depending on where you're from,
you might be using a different extractant
[SPEAKER_01]: solution such as Olson or Bray.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more Midwest or Western U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a Malik 3 or Morgan or a modified
Morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malik 3 is used by Penn State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the southern states and some
of the Midwest commercial labs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan historically has been used by
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modified Morgan is used by both AgriOne.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be used at Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's currently the procedure used at
Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of these measures a different
amount of phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a specific lab or a specific
state, the recommendations are based on
[SPEAKER_01]: rate response studies that have been
calibrated against the P and K soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: for that state or that lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sufficiency values are specific to
the extractant that's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relative levels, like I said, you might be
a little bit better off there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the actual absolute values
of PPM of phosphorus or potassium or
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds per acre, of phosphorus or
potassium, be very specific to the
[SPEAKER_01]: extractant used.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, Bray 1, that's one soil
test that was developed for use in the
[SPEAKER_01]: north central U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: on acid to neutral soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malik 3 works on a broad range of soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used by a lot of commercial soil
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dairy 1 has a Malik 3 package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Olson is a test that was developed for use
on alkaline soils, mostly out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: western U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan, which is also available through
Dairy 1 or AgriOne, was developed for acid
[SPEAKER_01]: soils here in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the modified Morgan is just a
modification that provides improved
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between those two is a
Morgan uses a sodium acetate extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: and the modified Morgan uses ammonium
acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll explain a little bit more about
that in a few moments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you get your soil test results,
typically you'll see different,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might have bar graphs that show the
relative levels on the soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're basically calibrated soil test
levels on one axis versus relative yield
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite simply, it's an index of
availability and crop response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in that very low to low range
on a soil test, it's very likely that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to, your crop will respond to
added inputs of lime and fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in that optimum range,
it's less likely that you're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: a big response to fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more likely to be, you know,
using maintenance applications to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil test levels in that optimum
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you get up into the high to
very high range, it's very unlikely or
[SPEAKER_01]: less likely, certainly, that you'll have
any significant response to added
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer or lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically how those soil test
interpretations are created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the Cornell interpretation,
if you look in the Cornell Field Crops
[SPEAKER_01]: Handbook, it goes into a little bit more
detail here, but basically the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: from very low nutrient level or pH is
sufficiently low that you really do need
[SPEAKER_01]: extra inputs of lime or fertilizer all the
way up to excess where very unlikely to
[SPEAKER_01]: have any benefit, but it is very likely to
cause it to increase the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're both very important to,
you know, understand those ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned already, most soil
tests do not routinely include boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron can be very important for some of
the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different tests,
but what we're using is a hot water boron
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, which is the preferred procedure
by Cornell, and it would be consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: with these relative ranges that you find
in some of the Cornell literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the analysis options
specifically for agro one, just as an
[SPEAKER_01]: example, you really need to, you might
need to study these a little bit because
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be easy to select the wrong
service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make sure, if you want to
get Cornell recommendations, that you
[SPEAKER_01]: select the agro one services with Cornell
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned before, the field crops are
using a morgan analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else will be modified morgan,
fruit, vegetable, turf, home lawn and
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The out of state soil health samples will
also be run modified morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually right now, in the arena of
fruit, if you want to get recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: from agro one, you really have to use,
one of the agro one services with Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd probably have to go through the soil
health option if you're out of state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We currently don't have recommendations
programmed in for the agro one services
[SPEAKER_01]: with agro one guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming, but we don't have those at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the agro one services with agro one
guidelines, we do conduct a malic three
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, and it's a little bit more cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The malic three than morgan or modified
morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of reasons for that,
one of which it's much less corrosive,
[SPEAKER_01]: easier test to run, less waste byproducts
to dispose of, less labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are reasons for the price
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Pennsylvania, we offer a malic three.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Maryland, they require a malic three
with fertilizer index value, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated value.
[SPEAKER_01]: For New York, we can do a malic three with
morgan equivalent values reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for other northeast states,
we run a malic three analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do on occasion get samples from outside
of the northeast, in which case we will
[SPEAKER_01]: run a malic three with generic
recommendations that are maybe not state
[SPEAKER_01]: specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we got something from Colorado,
we don't have recommendations for
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, so they would be more generic
northeast recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind if you wanted to send
samples to dairy one, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also run a modified morgan for
Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this sounds confusing, but there
are some minor differences between the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements, the modified morgan
procedures for Vermont and New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Vermont, we use an ICP phosphorus,
which is just the ICP is the piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment that we use to extract and
determine the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York, we use a modified morgan,
but we do a colorimetric phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a minor difference, but it's a
different requirement according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: state specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other labs in the northeast
that offer similar services.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, Maine does a modified
morgan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Penn State does a malic three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other commercial labs that
do a lot of business in the northeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: who offer various services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just need to check with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just remember, don't use test results
from one lab or a procedure from one lab
[SPEAKER_01]: and compare it with sufficiency ranges
from another lab or another procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as an example, here in New York,
and in our services, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: a malic three versus a morgan,
you might wonder, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how different could they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a malic three is going to extract
potentially anywhere from 30 to 300 times
[SPEAKER_01]: more phosphorus at high aluminum soil
levels at low pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will extract less phosphorus at a
high pH or low aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're comparing a malic three
that you use like you did last year with a
[SPEAKER_01]: morgan that you're doing this year,
you could get very different numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The modified morgan versus morgan,
they're pretty comparable overall,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you will see difference on potassium
values on some soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ammonium acetate in modified morgan,
the ammonium ion is smaller than sodium in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morgan extractant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll push that potassium that's
trapped between clay particles in the
[SPEAKER_01]: illite clay parent material in some New
York soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll push more of that potassium out
into the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll give a higher potassium number
than a morgan extractant would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, they're quite comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which lab should you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess you should use a lab that
offers procedures and nutrient guidelines
[SPEAKER_01]: that are appropriate for your region and
for your soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use test results from one lab or
procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sufficiency ranges from another lab or
procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I've already explained, that can get
you in trouble and get you very confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use caution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you're comparing one lab to
another, even when they're using the same
[SPEAKER_01]: extractant, because there can be some lab
to lab variability for the same procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might weigh the sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others might use a scoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might use ICP phosphorus versus
colorimetric phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil to solution ratio might be a
little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the shaking time might be a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these subtle differences,
even the grinder that they use to grind
[SPEAKER_01]: the dried sample can be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these subtle differences can
result in some variability that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stick with the same lab if possible
once you find one you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be careful when you're comparing one
lab to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: The report, this is just a sample of our
fruit report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up towards the top, you'll see the results
reported in pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you'll have the relative
sufficiency levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very low, low, optimum, high,
or very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Below that, you'll have some of the other
measurements such as pH or buffer pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is used to determine your lime
requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also see down below the
micronutrients that are included in the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard package, including manganese and
zinc and iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also provide organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then farther down below that,
you'll see the actual fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was an apple report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have pulled up a blueberry or a
berry report.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will give you the pounds per acre
of lime and the pounds per acre of N,
[SPEAKER_01]: P2O5, and K2O that's required to bring
that crop or that soil into the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say with apples, we do have a
surface and subsurface option with apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do have a paired sample for a
surface, which would be zero to eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: and subsurface, which is eight to 16,
you need to indicate that they're paired
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is used in generating one
recommendation based on the paired
[SPEAKER_01]: samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's only true of tree fruits,
not berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just finally, in summary, I think we
all know soil testing is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the whole process, if you want to
optimize yield and quality of berries and
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid issues with runoff into groundwater
or runoff into bodies of water,
[SPEAKER_01]: like any other analytical service,
it's garbage in, garbage out, or quality
[SPEAKER_01]: in, quality out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to get a good sample up
front and follow some of the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines that I provided relative to
establishing a sampling schedule,
[SPEAKER_01]: using the right tools, sampling at the
right depth, taking enough subsamples,
[SPEAKER_01]: and prepping that sample properly to get a
good representative composite sample in
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate boxes or bags from the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to select the appropriate
service, whether you're using a routine or
[SPEAKER_01]: a diagnostic service, and select the
appropriate extractant, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Morgan, Modified Morgan, or Malic 3,
and what the lab has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then following up every two to three
years, preferably with tissue analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the case of berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I covered a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it was probably a review.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have any other questions,
you can go to our website at www.DairyOne
[SPEAKER_01]: .com, or you can email me at Janet.Fallen
at DairyOne.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is one mistake on that slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying my cell phone number is no
longer the one that's on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So write this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do have a question for me,
my cell phone number is now 315-696.
[SPEAKER_01]: 0167, if you have any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to answer those for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I don't have an answer,
I can certainly get one from Marvin and
[SPEAKER_01]: get back to you promptly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much it, Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're getting close on time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have any other questions,
I'll try and answer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mariana has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have several growers wanting to grow
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any recommendations for organic
growers or a way to convert the
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations that are given?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, a soil test really isn't going
to differentiate between an organic or
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called conventional operation because
the crop nutrient requirements will be the
[SPEAKER_01]: same regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all in the interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do know that Cornell has been
working very diligently at coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some updated guidelines for using organic
sources of crop nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as those are available from
Cornell, they would be incorporated into
[SPEAKER_01]: the recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, we're just giving
recommendation on pounds of NP and K to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply to a crop to bring that or to a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to use organic soil to
bring it into balance, it's really up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the operator to meet those needs with
whatever source of nutrients they choose
[SPEAKER_01]: to use, whether it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, with organic, it's very
different because you tend to be using
[SPEAKER_01]: more organic or, excuse me, well,
yeah, not synthetic chemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but organic that may be slower in
releasing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think using that soil health program,
I think, is probably going to be a good
[SPEAKER_01]: way to address that issue for the organic
growers because it does address the
[SPEAKER_01]: physical and biological health of the soil
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a number of resources listed
on both the agro one link and also on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell links that would send you to
information on some of the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments for meeting crop nutrient
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of a yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: A soil test doesn't differentiate between
the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a question from Glenn.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does lime correction of pH
typically last before re-liming is needed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, that one is going to depend a
lot on a number of things, including soil
[SPEAKER_01]: texture, the parent material of the soil,
and how much nitrogen you're applying or
[SPEAKER_01]: other acidifying fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're applying large amounts
of nitrogen, for example, that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring the pH down faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a soil has a high buffer capacity,
it's going to resist changes in pH up or
[SPEAKER_01]: down more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might hold that pH longer once you
get it up to the desired pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a real sandy soil with a low
cation exchange capacity, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil pH may change more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it is going to depend on the
soil resource that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a comment from Marvin that the
N-Race production guides provide tables
[SPEAKER_02]: with organic nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use those to calculate how
much of an organic source you need based
[SPEAKER_02]: on the soil test recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob also has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's wondering if you or Marvin could talk
more about the Cornell soil health test
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they, if they've been used for
berry crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Bob Schundlbeck has been
working very extensively with vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: and fruit growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really haven't been privy to who and
what the results have been on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Marvin can type in some comments on
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that they are
targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher value crops, especially,
such as the fruits and vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: simply the testing is a bit more costly
than standard soil testing, as you would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on high value crops, it certainly is
worthwhile because it's a long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: investment to get that crop established
and keep it productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laura McDermott has commented that she's
used Cornell soil health tests with berry
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the purposes of this project in
year two, when we involve the growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: is to help build that database for Bob
Schundlbeck and for Harold Van Ness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have 50 growers that are going
to get complimentary soil health testing
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we can start to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I would like to just add is that
we do have a number of extension educators
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're currently set up on our searchable
database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can go online right now and
search by farmer, by date, by county,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, for soil tests, and also by
crop commodity, whether it's fruit or
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable or field crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe sometime around November 1,
we should be launching that service to all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our customers who have an account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're an extension educator,
check out our website here in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there should be some guidelines on how
to get assigned a username and a password.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be planning a little webinar to
walk people through the process of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: find their soil test reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also download some of
that information into tables or
[SPEAKER_01]: spreadsheets so you can compare trends
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, you won't have any
history the first time you start using us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but after a number of years and a number
of cycles soil testing, you'd have some
[SPEAKER_01]: comparative information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you want to do county summaries,
for example, that's another good use for
[SPEAKER_01]: the searchable database.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marvin did have a comment also that we're
just starting to use soil health tests for
[SPEAKER_02]: berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have major results yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vegetable growers are out in front on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have a question from Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any studies on the intensity of
soil sampling and the repeatability of
[SPEAKER_02]: results in small fruit production?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling that Marvin has an answer
to that one, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to believe that there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's been a lot of work done
with grid sampling and intensity of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling and repeatability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that with field crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin, I see he's typing frantically
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to guess that that's also
been done for berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not the person to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're waiting for Marvin to type in
his comments, we'll go to the exit screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says the greatest source of
variability is in the sampling,
[SPEAKER_02]: not in the testing procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone else has questions, be sure to
type them into the chat box.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, thank you very much,
Janet,
[SPEAKER_02]: for an excellent webinar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciated your input.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to announce that the next
webinar is the 11th of November.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Marvin Pritz is going to be our
speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The topic will be interpretation of soil
test results prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you haven't completed the
demographics questionnaire or the educator
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-test, you can download those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Janet has provided a PDF file on sampling,
which you're welcome to download also.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Agro One link is on the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted participants to know
that upon completion of the webinar
[SPEAKER_02]: series, you will receive a certificate
indicating your achievement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Janet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see you again on the 4th of
November.
Thank you very much.
