[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I want to give a little spiel
about the Friedrich Dreher Fellowship
[SPEAKER_00]: Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was started in 1956 by Friedrich
Dreher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's available to plant students and
landscape architecture students at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: to study plants, a horticultural topic of
their choosing, outside of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this has been going on for over a
half a century.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funded by an endowment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just for horticultural
students, but it has to follow a
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, we have a plant pathology
and a plant breeding student that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: away on Dreher Fellowships right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan Hall is in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: She works on grape sauerraut with Wayne
Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And James Keach works on inpatient
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's in Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's working on the propagation of
orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a rich history and a
plethora of topics that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: studied on this award.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big part of it is to get an
experience, not necessarily to study one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in particular for the purpose of
doing research to produce a product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for that recipient to get to
experience how things are done,
[SPEAKER_00]: how plants are grown, and a different part
of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Don mentioned, I had worked in
California and in Chile, which are more
[SPEAKER_00]: Mediterranean climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was a big shock coming to
upstate New York to see how things are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've certainly learned a ton during my
master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to take a look at Spanish
horticultural practices for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a long history of
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a mosaic in Merida,
which is from the Roman era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine has been made in Spain for over 3,000
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds of ridles native to the
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more area planted in the
vineyard than any other country in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they rank number fourth in the world
in wine grape production, largely because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really dry area that receives
little precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have good access to
irrigation, like sources to irrigate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, until 1996, it was illegal to
irrigate vineyards in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made that legal since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's starting to pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with such a long history of dry
farming, it is something that really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested me, especially with water
becoming such a hot button issue when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to horticulture in terms of farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a look at California,
we'll see how things develop there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also fluent in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'd make things easy for me to get
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, I was able to start to
head over in August I left to go to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, Spain has these really
tall mountains going right across the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have the Pyrenees right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the Cantabrian
Mountains, the Picos de Europa,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really sever off the rest of the
Iberian Peninsula from Northern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has a rain shadow across the
entire area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map that shows altitude,
not dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they have this large
central plateau, the Meseta Central.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this area that's
relatively dry and relatively high in
[SPEAKER_00]: altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a map that shows you precipitation
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the majority of the
country receives somewhere between 300 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 700, 800 milliliters of water a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that along the top,
you have this big band formed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is Galicia, what's again Asturias
known as Green Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk more about that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see where the vast majority of
Spain sits in this rain shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first place I went to go visit when
I went there was to visit my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignacio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Ignacio about five years ago when I
was living in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was his English teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, I wasn't a great English
teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of my better
horticulturist than I am a Spanish
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher, English teacher, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he since received a job promotion and
now lives in Madrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was, I have to say, it was
wonderful having him and his family there
[SPEAKER_00]: if I ever wanted a home cookout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in town, I was there, I could leave
extra things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first place we went was up to San
de Gallego in the Pyrenees Mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just shows you this giant,
that's what severs the rest of Spain from
[SPEAKER_00]: France.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's France right here along,
the border goes right along the tops of
[SPEAKER_00]: those mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what really divides Spain
from the rest of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also went up there to go to the Pyrenees
where there are no vineyards right off the
[SPEAKER_00]: bat because in August, Spain really goes
on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that it was just like a term,
like people say, like a lot of Europeans
[SPEAKER_00]: go on vacation in August, but really the
country shuts down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of city centers that are
just really empty and vacant then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But afterward, so I decided to go see a
couple of places that I really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I could focus on being able to
visit a lot more professionals later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first trip to study grapes went
down into Ronda, which is in Andalusia in
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Spain because they were starting
to harvest, I guess so they couldn't go on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Ronda is most famous for its
bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was built in the 18th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have several of them that span these
giant gorges up on this major plateau
[SPEAKER_00]: where Ronda sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it used to be, in the Roman area,
a major production of grapevines.
[SPEAKER_00]: After phylloxera hit, they really pared
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can see, so these are olive
groves right here, vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of this is wheat production,
primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the summer, they'll harvest in
late spring, early summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have a lot of barren ground
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really shocking to see this
vibrant, lush grape canopies coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this area that's otherwise so brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to Discosos Viejo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a winery in a 16th century monastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found these paintings behind
layers of plaster and paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to restore them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a beautiful, beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hung out with their analogist,
Vicente, and showed me around their
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they do a lot of really interesting
things in comparison to other areas that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try and crop heavier and not leaf
pull, like you would think in many areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they like to have more protection
for the grapes to shade them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that this is what the canopies
look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really cuts down on their labor
costs, where they have to do very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have to do much in terms
of hedging, et cetera, because the vines
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't grow that much, as far as other
interesting practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll plant vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the first growing season,
they'll cut them down to just two buds on
[SPEAKER_00]: the scion, just so they can promote all of
that, more resources towards root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: in those first years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, some really, really tasty wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a growing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to have a renaissance of
growing grapes after they got shut down
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area that I visited, which is a
little bit further to the east by the town
[SPEAKER_00]: of Nerja, are these vineyards,
which are about 1,000 meters here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mediterranean down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's up these windy roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the crow flies, you're only a couple
of kilometers away from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're up really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are Moscato de Alhambria grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has a really interesting history,
because they were originally used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: wine, historically, by the Romans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white muscat grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were kept in the region by the
Moors when they came by, because they make
[SPEAKER_00]: great raisins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's a move to take these
already existing vineyards and shift them
[SPEAKER_00]: from raisin production towards wine
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make a really lovely white wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dry muscat wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has those turpene type notes,
those overripe honey type flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a dry wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice, if you can find a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, I went to Jerez,
which is by the city of Cádiz,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's where sherry is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of my favorite places that
I got to visit in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really think that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that much about sherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this reputation, maybe like past
generations really like to drink sherry as
[SPEAKER_00]: an after dinner drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big reason why it's as big as it is
is that it sits right by the port city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cádiz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cádiz is the oldest city in Western
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phoenicians founded it about 3,000
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been making wine there for
three millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sherry is made in three cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jerez, Santa Marta, and Sanlúcar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between this triangle is where all of
the grapes are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily Palomino is the name of the
grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then aged in wineries in these three
cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what the area looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these rolling hills close to the
ocean with these really calcareous soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that is green here is grape
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they crop extraordinarily heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminded me of Concord production
around Western New York, where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: these extremely high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get up to 20-some tons per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grapes have really little acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have that much sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only ferment them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to maybe 10-11% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have any flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of just a body to then do
aging with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you have all of these sherry
houses where they have a system where in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to maintain uniformity of the
product of sherry, they'll have them aging
[SPEAKER_00]: where they decant maybe 10% down from the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the youngest wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the year, they'll put 10% down into
here, which goes down into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stuff on the floor is the
oldest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will head off to market then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some wine in here that's
probably close to 100 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been diluted down all that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order to maintain a consistent
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this has traditionally been,
the sherry has been something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the market goes outside of Spain
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because the grapes have so little
character, the terroir and the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get between different areas
really comes more from what the climate is
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the city where these things are
aged for 25 years or so before they're
[SPEAKER_00]: released, which is really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is they have head space in the
barrels where it's about 15% alcohol in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a yeast layer grows on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some on the bottom as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yeast produces a waxy film that
helps separate the wine from oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives it these yeasty flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what a Fino sherry is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more nutty sherry is those have higher
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are stored without this
biological layer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just straight up oxidized wine
essentially that's been fortified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's what the flavor you're going
for, it makes a great wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great wine to ship all over the
world because you can't really get any
[SPEAKER_00]: worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has high alcohol content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as something that you can put in
a barrel and send out all over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pretty resilient thing to ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been really interesting to learn
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of different things
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, so there is the
biological aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in between called an
amontillado, which is just fun to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are your dry sherry,
sweet sherry is where you add sweet wine
[SPEAKER_00]: from a Pedro Jimenez grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much to get into in just 45
minutes to go through everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these traditional zones called
tabancos, which are traditional areas
[SPEAKER_00]: where you go to drink sherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Pepe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his family has been running this
tabanco for about 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he tried to show me how the Pablo
Cortado is made on the bar counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also told me about a research
station, a germplasm collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: close by that I was able to go visit,
which was really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met with Dr. Miguel Benitez,
and he is the head of the germplasm
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the two chief germplasm
collections in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a lot of fun to see a lot of
different varieties that they have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clonal selection, the oldest clonal
selection in Spain was done in Jerez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jerez was one of the first cities in the
world to have electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine really pushed the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really wealthy city of splendor
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was tied to grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a long history of
research going on in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was able to learn a lot from him,
walking around their research station.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Melonera, which is one grape that
they're trying to bring back that's native
[SPEAKER_00]: to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really big berries, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have these lines along them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there I am in their research
station.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different fermentation trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after that, I shot clear across
Spain and up to Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of you know,
Maya Dalavalle, she was a master's student
[SPEAKER_00]: in food science, working in analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her family owns the Dalavalle winery in
Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is currently a student at the
University of Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I knew that she was there,
she invited me to crash on her couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't refuse that invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, many of you probably know Miss
Amanda Sims.
[SPEAKER_00]: A former student of Alan Laxo came over so
we overlapped and could go visit Bordeaux
[SPEAKER_00]: together, which was a lot of fun to have a
travel companion that spoke a smattering
[SPEAKER_00]: of French.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't speak any French.
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's a general map of Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest appellation in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity there is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the Madoc around here,
which is more flat and gravelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have Salternes being made around
graves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the whole Saint-Emilion
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get into too much detail
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really amazing to see places
that produce $5 bottles of wine versus 500
[SPEAKER_00]: euro bottles of wine, which was something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see that they have really,
really tight spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plays out with how they spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are their sprayers, really,
really narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can spray four rows at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they have such tight
planning, maybe a meter, a meter and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half between rows and maybe a meter
between plants, they're able to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really high density of canopy in this
system, which works out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also makes the vines compete with one
another because they're in a more wet
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works out to their favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how these things look like
when they snake through these vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have these spider-looking
vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how they're making tractors
that go over the rows, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got to visit Cheval Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Klaus van Leeuwen, who came last year,
who is a professor at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bordeaux, also does some consulting work
with Cheval Blanc, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest end Bordeauxs in the world,
which is a lot of fun to see how they do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are their concrete tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no practical reason for that,
just because they look pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they look cool, but that's the only
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was able to see some really cool
ground cover management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a semi-owned block in a
Salterne vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older vines, because the production is
lower, they'll leave no ground cover,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas in newer vines, they will leave
ground cover to try and equilibrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: two blocks at Cheval Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have cultivation practices where
they try and move the top 10 centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: of ground, where they push it under the
vines and then bring it back down to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep roots from growing in that top
layer, which prevent them from absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: water during summer rains, which could
help promote berry splitting or the
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution of flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was fun to pick up a little bit of
know-how of what they do around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then after Bordeaux, I went to Pays
Basque around here and to Galise.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Greenspan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where a lot of white wine is
made in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a bunch of winemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget her name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inaki, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Basque names are really difficult to
pronounce for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she had a great conversation telling
me about how she manages her vineyards in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area to make Chacolis, which is a
really high acid wine that's grown in Pays
[SPEAKER_00]: Basque.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really interesting area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really similar to the Finger Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it reminds me a lot of the Finger Lake,
except for the palm trees around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only reason is that they can
survive the winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get that cold during the
winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have really similar problems with
downy mildew and things of that manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have normal VSP trellises.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the area, they have pergola
trellises, where you have these posts and
[SPEAKER_00]: then a bunch of wires on top, where it
creates essentially a roof over the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows them to achieve much higher
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also makes mechanization nearly
impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have these really cool tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're so low, you can't enclose
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have these really low
tractors to be able to get underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these guys wear these spacesuits
hooked up to respirators in order to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's just funny to see how
creative people get to deal with these
[SPEAKER_00]: different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in an Alborino vineyard in Rias
Paisas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a lot of granite
everywhere in this area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the pergola system here is
supported by granite posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is made out of stone there,
even vineyard posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also really interesting to see the
different pace of how people work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying, most of the work here
has to be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picking crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're paid by hour, not by weight,
like they are in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are just kind of taking their
time just going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different pace to how everything
is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wages are still relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you can see, with the price
points of wines in the liquor store,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain is really competitive, especially
for the quality of what they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of people that do their
own farming on a small level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see just a couple of older women
driving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are labrusca grapes right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harvesting to make wine on their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of people that make
their own wine, make their own cider,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, and have their own small
plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big part of the culture to have
your own garden, have your own small
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that have fairly
sized, fairly large tracts of land that
[SPEAKER_00]: they take care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after Galicia, I went on to Toro
and then to Ribera de Duero, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the more famous areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't think of anything more
unlike Galicia when I got to Toro,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just this dry, sun-baked,
barren place with really sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vines, they're spaced three meters
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three meters by three meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's very little work that people
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cultivate once a year in the
spring, because after that, nothing can
[SPEAKER_00]: reestablish roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets so dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vines are not grafted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no phylloxera in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylloxera can't grow in vines that are
this sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce a variety called tinte de
Toro, which is really, really dark and
[SPEAKER_00]: rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, most of the costs are
everything is hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be hand done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hand thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hand prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hand pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't mechanize any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as things change, we'll see what
the difference is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of the differences that I
saw between newer vineyards and older
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards is trying to bring in the
capability to mechanize is the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting things on a trellis for no
other reason, just to be able to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: it mechanically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really difficult to do that when
you need to maintain spacing this wide
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nowhere to find water to irrigate
here, even if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of dictates how are you able
to grow in these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the difference in the
carbonically macerated grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the difference in color that
this makes, as opposed to a traditional
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it adds a lot of variety and
fruitiness there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever see that anything is
carbonically macerated, it means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial fermentation was done in an
absence of oxygen with whole berries that
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented a little bit inside of
themselves that produce these really
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should try it if you haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I went to Ribera de
Duero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a newer area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's really wide spacing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right by the Rio de Duero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these areas have irrigation,
really more of a security system than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's a really flat valley,
they're able to get away with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have big spacing, big vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the areas are, you can see
everything is just on a really large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this is because it wasn't a big
traditional wine producing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a view from on top of a castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, they would have the best views
of the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this used to be sunflower and
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only recently turned over.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 1980s, they started to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, actually,
a lot of the better budget wines coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out of Spain are coming from Ribera de
Duero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rioja is maybe the more famous area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a big, big proponent and fan of
things coming out of Ribera de Duero,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for your more economic wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of large volume
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what they go around there is
Tempranillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tried maybe the best to rob my life
when I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a winery called Bodegas Vizar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to meet up with the owner,
Felipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he invited me to a bullfight
afterwards, which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that I'm glad I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'd want to go to more
bullfights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a really beautiful spectacle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty gruesome at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ribera de Duero is maybe by volume the
second most important wine producing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important one is Rioja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the most famous one is Rioja,
which is situated in this little valley
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have just a stunning looking
valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing better than just getting a
rental car and cruising around these small
[SPEAKER_00]: little towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dotted with these medieval walled
towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite place in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The food is fantastic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Logroño is a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: The capital has about 150,000 people in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a must see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that you have this small
patchwork of vineyards here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been producing wines here for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are under a hectare in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met some families.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had titles to these blocks since
the 1400s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really interesting area in terms
of how people are able to work with this
[SPEAKER_00]: patchwork and this history.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big reason why it became such a big
famous wine producing area is because when
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylloxera was ravaging France,
a lot of French winemakers came to Rioja.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had good connection with rail lines
going back up to France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an excellent wine grape producing
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that lethal?
[SPEAKER_00]: The virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also Tempranillos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is later in the season, closer to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tempranillo, you think of it as the
Spanish grape that is able to survive in
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think is this hot Mediterranean
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more finicky than I thought it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a relatively cool climate in
comparison to a lot of other areas in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really gets zapped when you have
it in higher heat areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, wind can really easily damage its
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when that happens, then they'll
send out a secondary shoot and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll have fruit that comes out off of a
secondary, which blooms later,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that it's delayed in ripeness
behind the primary crop, which can cause
[SPEAKER_00]: big problems when you're trying to harvest
that block, because then you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of unripe fruit that's mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which isn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have it in the right
conditions to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why you don't really see it
outside of Spain that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does really well under these specific
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it hasn't really adapted well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't really been exported that well
to other areas, because I think that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a number of factors that it really
needs to produce good wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see up here, so they have the
Contabrian Mountains right against the
[SPEAKER_00]: north, you can see that it really stops a
lot of bad weather from coming in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just cross over that mountain
range, you're in Asturias, you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Contabrian area around Pais Basco right up
there, which is a really, really green
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, from where I was showing you those
photos earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gets this really stunning
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was on the end of the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, rose bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rose bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people say that that's to,
I guess like a canary in the coal mine for
[SPEAKER_00]: different diseases attacking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really more of traditionally,
the story I do buy is putting them there
[SPEAKER_00]: so that horses traditionally wouldn't
scratch the end posts and dislodge them,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were covered in thorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I think is more feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can just see that it's this really
beautiful area, like with a small
[SPEAKER_00]: patchwork of vines everywhere,
which I think would be a nightmare to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you go up the sides of these
hills, and so it makes it really difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to irrigate in this area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't see much irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, because so many of these vines are
so old, it'd just be really difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: install a system that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have a lot of your older,
like premier wines being produced there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from a wine like Sierra Cantabria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this big labyrinth of caves
underneath their facility, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: something to behold in some exquisite
wines, like fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things that are normally out of my
price range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that Rodeoja makes great,
excellent wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as their base level,
there are other regions in Spain that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think have a lot more potential than
Rodeoja does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like your fine, nuanced wines,
they're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're as good as your
baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your grad students happy,
type wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in the town of Briones, if you're
ever in Rodeoja, this is the best wine
[SPEAKER_00]: museum that I've ever been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of the Corning
Museum of Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you all been to the Corning Museum of
Glass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they have a great science section,
and then they have a great art section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really ties the two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that always kind of
interested me in viticulture and analogy
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a collection of a bunch of
different corkscrews.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have tens of thousands of corkscrews
all lined up according to their different
[SPEAKER_00]: styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a wonderful section on how to
grow grapes, how to make corks,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make barrels, how to make bottles,
how to make glass bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this great technology area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a beautiful,
beautiful art museum all dedicated to
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have old biblical scenes that
feature wine, or cups that are 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years old that were used to serve wine
from Persia, or Picasso's that feature a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus, it's in Briones, which is this
beautiful old medieval town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't say enough about Rodeoja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after Rodeoja, I started an internship
in the town of Borja, which is in Aragon,
[SPEAKER_00]: the capital is Zaragoza, Borja.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a town of about 5,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a whole lot going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really agricultural town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun to live there just to
get that authentic, off-the-beaten-path
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although Borja recently became famous
because it is the home of, so here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: owner, no, the head of viticulture for
Berdegas Borsal, who I was working for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally got to go around to hundreds
and hundreds of these small vineyards up
[SPEAKER_00]: in these high areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority is garnacha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also spread in with a lot of almond
orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almonds are going bananas up there because
of the drought in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really boosted the price of almonds
on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a big move towards almond
production in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have all of these small,
small plots of grapes in this area as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borsal is part of a collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are maybe 600 different farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are professional farmers
full-time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll produce olives or almonds or
grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the collective has to buy all of the
grapes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big diversity in what gets
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have wine that's made into
five-liter jugs that sell for five euros?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there are garnachas that win 100 points
from Robert Parker and cost close to $100
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a really big diversity,
which is so much fun to see such a
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in vineyards when I was out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much fun, especially to work
with Alberto the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been working there for 20 years for
this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't know how he knew where all
the different vineyards were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was just this maze of dirt
roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow he would know how to get to
all these different little under one
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare size plots all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A part of it that was really interesting
is that we did very little chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of grapes to figure out when we
would harvest and what kind of wine to
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do everything by taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would just go around and eat grapes
all day, which is actually really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are really, really tannic
and sugary grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about it too much,
chewing on things too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I destroyed my mouth within a couple
of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all chapped lips and sores in my
tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I was able to get faster
with how I would do all the tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to do that and taste from
so many different vineyards and talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's an expert was maybe the most
important thing that took away from
[SPEAKER_00]: working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really unique opportunity,
especially to be able to taste from
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of vineyards to make all these
comparisons, which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Borja is famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently was in the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became famous because it's the home of
the Eche Homo de Borja, which is a tiny,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many slides I get mixed up in
what's coming next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so this is a very large winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have machine harvested grapes being
dropped off to a subterranean crusher that
[SPEAKER_00]: then push things to the large tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really large facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go through thousands and
thousands of tons of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do small lot fermentations as
well, a big, big range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's home of the Eche Homo de Borja.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what Borja is most famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this funky painting that this
woman was going to restore and did a
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible job on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's more famous than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bringing in tourists from all over
the world to take a look at this painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it looked like before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the restoration job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would argue that it is not the
weirdest or creepiest painting in Borja.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this great cafeteria that I
became friends with the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd eat there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have my lunch and dinner there every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hanging up in his restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an original from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the former king of Spain,
Carlos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Spain here being upheld by a
bunch of hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a rather svelte,
bare-chested King Charles wearing a gold
[SPEAKER_00]: necklace with his arms crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing out of the land, as well as a
naked pair with a pregnant woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at that every day for five weeks
for lunch and dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd see that every day just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what I think the area should
be more famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just these old vine, like these
old, old Grenache vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are 60 years plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just these gnarly, old-looking vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they produce some of the most
exquisite-tasting wine that I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have these fiery red soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a big diversity in what
you find out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a beautiful area, as well,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a bad place to hang out for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we learned a lot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's something to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grenache, it's the most planted red
grape variety for wine in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's Tempranillo on either side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Grenache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see that it is resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It crops heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is late, late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the last thing to come in,
just because it can really hang on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under these conditions, you can see
that the Tempranillo is starting to fall
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could identify what variety of vineyard
was from hundreds of meters away,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because you can see the condition
that the canopy is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grenache is really pretty beastly,
heavy-duty grape that can handle a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it really needs these to
produce high-quality fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of people plant it in
other areas just because it can handle
[SPEAKER_00]: adversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, they crop it really,
really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really work out that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fun to learn about Grenache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, the harvest was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really too much more to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apples were still in season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went up to Asturias to learn about
cider production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I'm really interested
in apples and cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Asturias is a really, really
beautiful area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's wedged between the Picos de
Europa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what the mountains look like in
the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really weird, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see herds of goats and sheep
walking through there with shepherds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of cheese up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bordered by the sea, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really, really stunning area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a strong tradition of making
cider, just because grapes don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: grow on that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really different than other
varieties of cider that you may be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of, because it is more acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go through malolactic
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not carbonated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to aerate it, they pour it from a tall
height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in a cedar area, where they
pour it from, like the waiters hold it
[SPEAKER_00]: above their head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have these little splash guards,
because otherwise, you make a mess
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some places that have drains in
the floor, where they just hose the place
[SPEAKER_00]: down every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traditional way to do it is out of a
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is Cesar.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really, really nice, showing me
around the whole area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, traditionally,
they were served out of tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all the mess that he's
making there, splashing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that Spanish cider,
traditionally, can be expanded,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're supposed to just pour a little bit
and then down it in a few gulps,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's still cloudy, with all of the
gas and carbonation from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a lot of fun to learn about
their production practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met with a couple of professors that
studied this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the orchards are really small in
size, because you have such diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: topography in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a lot of people that just
manage these as a side business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not their full-time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, they don't fruit
thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't spray anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grow apples, harvest them,
and turn them into cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really interesting to see
different strategies for growing these in
[SPEAKER_00]: these minimal investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just drop them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have all these different varieties
mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really make blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just make cider with what shows up at
the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really surprised to see them all
thrown together like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the prettiest apples,
but they make great tasting cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, they were made in these
giant oak vats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Roberto, the owner of a large
cidery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're traditionally made in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's more like white wine
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the facilities look similar to a
lot of wineries I've been to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to help empty out a press in a
smaller cidery I was able to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they really diversify.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to export and grow the
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to diversify what they're
producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your traditional Australian
cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also trying to make bottle
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like fermented ciders that are similar to
a champagne, selling apple cider vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or this is a still cider, which is with
some juice added back to make it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to export more and
diversify what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to see how they're
trying to move things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also did a couple of other fun
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Porto for a weekend with
Ignacio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There I am at a port house with Malay,
his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hiked 100 kilometers along the Camino de
Santiago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old pilgrim route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a Campo Stella from the Catholic
Church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a get into heaven free card.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that going for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents came by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to show them around to play tour
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we are in Sevilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I probably ate about my own body
weight in jamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his own food group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then in the final weeks of my tour,
I went down to Peru rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, I lived there for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there for the wedding of my two
good friends, Nelly and Killian,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to read at their wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little nervous reading in Spanish
in front of a couple hundred people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it worked out fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also was able to check out great
production when I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to check out great production
when I was down there, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: different than other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just see how barren all this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they produce a lot of different
varieties up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Octavio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs a Pisco production area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pisco, it's like a Grappa or an Uzo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a distilled grape liqueur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was growing grapes out here that
were in bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had labrusco vines on the other
side that were already in veraison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they control, because it's in
this semi-tropical environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they control everything with
irrigation and pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get three harvests in two years
off of their labruscos, but they try and
[SPEAKER_00]: just do one a year for their perniferas to
make Pisco out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really bizarre to see how they do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The area produces a lot of cochinilla,
which are the little scale insects that
[SPEAKER_00]: the dye industry uses to make red dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same area where they grow
cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even have to irrigate cactus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can see what the ceramic
stills that they use to make Pisco are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like two feet taller than everyone
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also a bit of an oddity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't too many gringos making it
that far out into this area around
[SPEAKER_00]: Arequipa.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take a look at Pisco production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to see these are the old
fermenting vats that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these date back to the 1700s,
most of them were from the early to
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-1800s in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are just the old, old technology
that's still in use in these areas to
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these Piscos, this is what an old
press looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are what the clay vessels,
called Piscos, that were originally used
[SPEAKER_00]: to ferment and then transport Pisco in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in Ica, which is the primary
grape-producing region in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, again, a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right outside of Ica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it has some of the tallest sand
dunes in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A barren doesn't even start to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just have this slice of green
that goes through there where they
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the oldest agriculture in the
Americas comes from coastal Peru in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area, where they were irrigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, they were irrigating cotton
and not a food crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were irrigating cotton to make
textiles and nets to go fish on the coast
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so a really, really old history
of irrigation and agriculture in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area, where also the oldest vineyards in
South America are in this area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I finished up my travels
for my journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to come home right before
Christmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to say thank you, thank you,
thank you to the DREER committee for
[SPEAKER_00]: letting me have this amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being away also gave me a lot of time to
reflect and figure out what it is I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I wouldn't have wound up
back here to work on my PhD if it weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited about what's coming
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much in addition to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the tip of the iceberg,
trying to give you the highlights of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have any other questions,
I'd be more than happy to answer them for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the almonds with grits in the dry area
seems weird, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because isn't it almonds that use a ton of
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they space them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just give them a lot more space
between trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's a dry area, but it's not
as dry as other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Adagon, there's enough water around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still pretty scrubby, but they have
oak forests in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like Toro that I showed you with
that three meter by three meter spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as barren as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some moisture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just like with grapevines,
where if they space them out, they have
[SPEAKER_00]: lower yields per area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because they were actually like 11
gallons to one pound of almonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the price point of almonds right
now, they're making money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting more in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how long that lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, whether these trees will be in
production down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's working for them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the Spanish government regulate
production like the French government does
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of their grapes, in terms of
yields per hectare?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the denomination of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, I know that in certain areas,
they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pérez, with the sherry production in
Palomino grapes, they really try and limit
[SPEAKER_00]: that, just because there's a tendency to
try and crop so heavy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have one of the oldest
denomination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the oldest denomination of origin
in Spain is from Pérez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they try and control it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there is some control in other
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to produce hybrid
vines or labrascas in any areas of that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of couple going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those might have been for personal
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there is some control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not as regulated as France.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a big impression that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these areas, the temperatures may
reach 40, 45 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you still make good wine out of those
grapes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of it comes down to close of
our selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are Spanish grapes that
were developed in these areas that get
[SPEAKER_00]: extraordinarily hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also try and leave more vegetation
around the fruit zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so dry, they don't have to
worry about the disease pressure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about in other areas by
having less airflow or less light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration on the berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by shading them more with leaves,
you protect them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to worry as much about
disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can still get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets up to 40, 45 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the entire season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll happen in July and in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get these big, warm temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other times of the year,
it'll be quite cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have these big diurnal swings in
temperature, because you're in such a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: climate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may only reach that hot for a couple
of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any final questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, thanks so much, Adam.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
