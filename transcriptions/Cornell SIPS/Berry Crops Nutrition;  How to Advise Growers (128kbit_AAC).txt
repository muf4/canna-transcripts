[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of other people who might want to
vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close that poll, and we'll move to the
last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Berry crop most able to use higher rates
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got about 11 folks voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we will move into the presentation
portion of the class of the webcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to introduce, I don't really
think he needs too much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction, Dr. Marvin Pritz,
who is the small fruit specialist at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also the horticulture department
chairman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is his second webcast of this
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nutrient management in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marvin, you can take it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks, everyone, for joining.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a convenient way to be in touch with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to talk about nutrient
management in berry crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, our challenge is the
diversity of berry crops that we have out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one requires some specificity in
terms of its nutrient needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're going to do is try to focus
on some general principles instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably one principle that cuts
across all these berry crops in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient managements are first,
get a soil test prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've all heard this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that allows us to adjust the pH in our
nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for perennial fruit crops,
once the plants are growing in the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: a leaf analysis is usually the best way to
fine tune your fertilization program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you followed the soil test
correctly and got the pH right and got the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient levels right, at least for the
first five or six years, you may not have
[SPEAKER_02]: to do anything in terms of fertilizer
application except for maybe nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, if you've done it right and
put those nutrients into the soil before
[SPEAKER_02]: you plant, you can have that long of a
time before you have to go in and start
[SPEAKER_02]: fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most berry crops, you might be
ready to replant by that time anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the two overriding principles
for all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if you don't follow that
test?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you find out later, oh,
my soil pH is too low and I have to add
[SPEAKER_02]: some lime and where to get those plants
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you end up with kind of a mess
because you're putting lime over top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the planting and it doesn't really work
its way into the ground very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it blows around and it's always best
to do that before you plant so you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: end up trying to apply lime after the
plants are in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So soil testing is real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once the plants are growing,
we can take leaves from those plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of summer after things are sort
of stabilized and look at the nutrients in
[SPEAKER_02]: those leaves and we can tell whether
they're in the adequate range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're not, we can make a
recommendation on how to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of these tests can be done at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be done through private labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is using the nutrient
analysis after the plants are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground is the best way we can tell what to
do with your plants and give
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: These standard fuller nutrient ranges are
good only if the soil pH is in the right
[SPEAKER_02]: range.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the soil pH is off, then these values
all become off and it doesn't do any good
[SPEAKER_02]: to play around with potassium or calcium
or boron if the basic problem is the pH is
[SPEAKER_02]: too high or too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you know your pH is in the right
range, then rely on the leaf analysis for
[SPEAKER_02]: modifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each of those leaf analyses,
they're specific for different crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blueberry one will be different
than the strawberry one and will be
[SPEAKER_02]: different than the raspberry one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to talk about though are
some of the specific nutrient requirements
[SPEAKER_02]: for, in this case, blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start off with blueberries because
you probably get a lot of questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, one of the questions I asked
earlier was what's the most common problem
[SPEAKER_02]: across the country with blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer that most of you got was
the pH being too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing and the most important
thing in growing blueberries is
[SPEAKER_02]: testosterone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to take some soil pH and
make sure you bring it down to about 4.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty low for most crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually it's going to take some sulfur
and incorporate it into the soil and let
[SPEAKER_02]: even that sulfur work for several months
before the site will be suitable for
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a while you'll find a site,
particularly maybe down where Sandy is on
[SPEAKER_02]: Long Island, where the soils are already
naturally low in pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can plant blueberries directly into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most soils you have to apply some
sulfur to get that to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries are very slow growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes several years before they reach
maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figure about eight years from the time
you plant by the time they're really full
[SPEAKER_02]: grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some adaptations to these low
pH, low nutrient soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, if you're walking through the
woods and out hiking around, you will find
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries in sites that tend to have
acidic, sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually sometimes it's wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they can grow there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the adaptations that
blueberries have is that the roots have an
[SPEAKER_02]: association with endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these fungi actually colonize the fine
roots of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll hyphae grow out into the soil
and aid in phosphorus and nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not all plants have endomycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, just a few do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Ericaceae family, the blueberries
belong to, is one that has this
[SPEAKER_02]: association.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows them to tolerate soils that tend
not to have a lot of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where a lot of the nitrogen is in the
ammonium form as opposed to the nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your garden, where you have fairly
high pH and the soils are warm,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have a lot of water out there,
most of the nitrogen gets converted by the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil bacteria into the nitrate form that
plants can readily take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can fertilize your garden plants with
ammonium sources of fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the bacteria convert it to nitrate and
then the plants take it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries have the unique ability to
take up the ammonium ion directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes them really suitable for low
pH, wet or cooler soils where the
[SPEAKER_02]: predominant form of nitrogen is the
ammonium ion anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries can also tolerate very high
levels of manganese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because manganese variability goes up a
lot when the soil pH drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if plants didn't have the ability to
tolerate that, when you lower the pH in
[SPEAKER_02]: some soils, the manganese would go so high
that it would be toxic to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But blueberries have the ability to
sequester that manganese and vacuoles and
[SPEAKER_02]: allow the plant to tolerate relatively
high levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that blueberries can
do is they can tolerate low levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, high levels of calcium is
pretty detrimental to blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not do well where the calcium in
the soil is over, say, 2,000 pounds per
[SPEAKER_02]: acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of soils have calcium that are
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen soils where the pH is low,
but the calcium levels are high,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the blueberries just don't do well
even though the pH is low.
[SPEAKER_02]: That calcium just doesn't help the plants
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is blueberry roots grown in nitrate
nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that the nitrate form of
nitrogen makes the roots sort of die,
[SPEAKER_02]: causes necrosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not like the nitrate form of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the ammonium form of nitrogen,
they can do just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly, if you did this with a
tomato or a pepper or any other
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberry, it would just be the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ammonium force-fed plants would have
black roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nitrate force-fed plants would be just
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that high levels of
nitrogen fertilizer is detrimental to the
[SPEAKER_02]: endomycorrhizal fungi and hence hurt the
blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to fertilize with too
much nitrogen on blueberries because it
[SPEAKER_02]: hurts the plants and the fungal
association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that hurts the plants is too
much chloride.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you fertilize with potassium
chloride or muriata potash, you may be
[SPEAKER_02]: applying too much chloride.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on blueberry plants, we recommend if
you have to apply potassium to apply
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot safer to use than potassium
chloride around blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: More expensive, but it's safer to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we manage blueberries and sort
of put this all together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we pick a site with adequate pore
space in the soil, select a site with low
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium, ideally less than 1,800 pounds
per acre of calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: High organic matter is really important
for blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do well when the organic matter
is low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower the pH, usually the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can lower that with sulfur until
you get down around 4.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under low nutrient condition, or under low
pH conditions, sometimes magnesium becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: unavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes you have to apply
supplemental magnesium in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: compensate for the lower pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rarely any others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually on your pre-plant soil test,
you might not have to ever apply
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus because blueberries are really
good at sequestering phosphorus to those
[SPEAKER_02]: endomycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you want to have is, the more the
better, you can grow blueberries on muck
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ideally, if you have four to six
percent, that would be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also helps to buffer against that pH
requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in say a sandy soil with very little
organic matter, you've got to be right
[SPEAKER_02]: about 4.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a sandy soil with a lot of organic
matter, you can cheat a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not have to go much below five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that just provides a buffer for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then mulching with sawdust and wood
chips to maintain the organic matter and
[SPEAKER_02]: the moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you fertilize blueberries,
we recommend ammonium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_02]: or urea, as opposed to other sources of
fertilizer that might contain nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, the nitrates are toxic to
the blueberry roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ammonium sulfate is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blueberries really like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you apply increasing amounts of the
plant ages up to about 65 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not in the first year, maybe 10 pounds
the next year per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 20, 30, 40, all the way up until
you have about 65, 70 pounds on a bush
[SPEAKER_02]: that might be seven or eight years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work out of Michigan has found that uptake
is much more efficient if you split the
[SPEAKER_02]: application between bloom and then six
weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to recommend putting all the
nitrogen down in April.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we've found that it's much more
efficient to put it on probably in May
[SPEAKER_02]: when they first bloom and then six weeks
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with putting it down in April
was that the roots were not active at that
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that nitrogen was leaching
before the roots had a chance to take it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to wait until the roots are
warm and then put it on in a split
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you are using lots of mulch,
you may have to increase the rate above
[SPEAKER_02]: that 65 pounds per acre to compensate for
the mulch that tends to tie up some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a blueberry plant on the left-hand
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a plant with adequate nitrogen
and one over here with inadequate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just look at the plant just not
nearly as green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the symptoms of too low
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly common in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is that pH drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: The availability of magnesium also drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can get in a situation
where yeah, you got to have the pH low,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also makes the magnesium
unavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may have to add some Epsom salts,
which is magnesium sulfate, to build that
[SPEAKER_02]: back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a symptom that you might get
when magnesium is low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's pretty distinctive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it sort of a Christmas tree
pattern where you get red colors between
[SPEAKER_02]: the veins and the veins themselves stay
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a real characteristic of
magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what's going on within the
plant is the plant isn't able to make
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorophyll at that level it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chlorophyll disappears.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't as much of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other pigments in the leaf start
to show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you almost get the fall colors maybe in
the middle of summer showing up because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not enough chlorophyll to mask the
other anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a high pH is the most common
problem across the country with
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the symptom of high pH is what we call
iron chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is similar to what you saw with
magnesium deficiency, except in this case,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves turn yellow instead of red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it has to do with the pigments
that are manufactured and are expressed
[SPEAKER_02]: when the iron isn't available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, interestingly enough, iron is one of
the most common elements in the Earth's
[SPEAKER_02]: crust.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's usually lots of iron in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant just isn't able to take it up if
the pH is too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could add all the iron you want to
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the pH is too high, the plants are
still going to be yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two things you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is you can spray iron chelate on the
leaves and sort of foliar feed some iron
[SPEAKER_02]: and that will green up the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's only temporary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The solution to this problem is a
reduction in the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you lower the pH, then the iron
can become in its active form and be taken
[SPEAKER_02]: into the plant and used to manufacture
chlorophyll and other pigments that will
[SPEAKER_02]: turn the leaves green again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another deficiency that we sometimes see
on blueberries, particularly in sandy
[SPEAKER_02]: soils, is potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it creates a distinctive
symptom of this marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like maybe the plants didn't get
watered and they dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of that's what's happening
physiologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium is used to help transport water
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without potassium, you don't have stomates
open and closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's closing properly and you get this
burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the potassium is low, even though
you have adequate irrigation, adequate
[SPEAKER_02]: water, you still might get this symptom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen this not so much in New
York, but I have seen it in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just something to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boron is a nutrient that's relatively
commonly deficient in our soils in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see symptoms of boron deficiency a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a boron deficient blueberry
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the grower thought this was winter
injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, it looks very much like winter
injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't find any pathogen on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a canker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I assumed it was winter injury,
even though the winters weren't that cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, bottom line is we did foliar
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The boron tested out really low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they applied a couple of pounds of
boron per acre and the problem went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it looks like on blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see in a few minutes some more
distinctive symptoms on strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a healthy blueberry field,
what you like to see, grass between the
[SPEAKER_02]: rows, straw mulch, and vigorously growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's shift to strawberries for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a woody plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an herbaceous perennial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a target pH of about 6 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making adjustments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for strawberries, growers aren't adding
sulfur to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're generally adding lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring the pH up a little bit so it's in
the adequate range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, strawberries are grown as either
annuals or perennials, depending on what
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the country you're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some parts of the country, people are
doing both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people in New York are playing around
with annual strawberry production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in practice, some growers apply up to
400 pounds per acre of actual nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouted over the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But data show that strawberry plants can
only use about 100 pounds that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in many annual systems, 300 pounds is
just being wasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just being washed through the soil
profile and into the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberries are very inefficient at
sequestering nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root systems are somewhat shallow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not very extensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to really spoon feed
strawberries nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't expect them to take a lot of
it out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow strawberries in New York mostly as
perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the growth of a strawberry in
our system occurs in early spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: right after we take the mulch off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when carbon and nitrogen can be
eliminated because the plants have been
[SPEAKER_02]: under the mulch all winter long.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've used up all their carbon just
during the process of respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nitrogen was used up last spring and
fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're deficient in both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the mulch off, and they need to
put on this really fast growth spurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of strawberries in the planting year,
planting them in July.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how the strawberry plant grows
kind of slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It slows down in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we go through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It loses some biomass during the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next spring, it just really takes
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll push of growth at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So logic would have it that, well,
we ought to be fertilizing our
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries right about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's right before the big growth
spurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants need a lot of nitrogen and
carbohydrate then to sustain itself during
[SPEAKER_02]: this rapid growth spurt when it's
fruiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in actuality, we've done studies that
show that those spring nitrogen rates make
[SPEAKER_02]: the fruit really soft and increases our
botrytis incidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've did this for three years in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every year, we got the same results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything more than about 30 pounds of
actual nitrogen per acre really softened
[SPEAKER_02]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if spring's kind of out because it
softens the fruit, when should we
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilize strawberries?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer seems to be immediately
after harvest in July.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wait until that fruit comes off,
then put down some of your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't want to put it all down then
because strawberries aren't efficient at
[SPEAKER_02]: taking up nitrogen from the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we put maybe two thirds of it on after
harvest, and then another third of it on
[SPEAKER_02]: in early July.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early September prior to flower bud
formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be the best timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The roots are active.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you spoon feed them a little bit
during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have done some research to show
that fall foliar fertilization helps
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to increase the nitrogen reserves
just before the plant goes into the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put fall foliar applications on
during the summer, it stimulates
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants grow more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't result in more yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like if you wait until after
growth is over, and then you put the fall
[SPEAKER_02]: foliar fertilization on, like October,
early October, the strawberry plant takes
[SPEAKER_02]: up that nitrogen, but it's not going to
grow anymore because it's too cold and the
[SPEAKER_02]: day length is short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that nitrogen actually goes into the
reserve pools of nitrogen and then is
[SPEAKER_02]: available for the following spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that five pounds of foliar urea,
nitrogen as foliar urea in the fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: gives us as big of a yield kick as maybe
30 pounds the following spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very efficient time to put on a
foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some data sort of hot off the
press from a study that we did on
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizing strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this axis here, we have increasing
rates of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew the plants with increasing
rates of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then here we looked at how much
nitrogen was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, no surprise, we fertilize more
and we get more fertilizer in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: more nitrogen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with just a little bit of fall
fertilizer as well, foliar fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can increase the amount of nitrogen in
the plant quite a bit by just putting on a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of applications in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trade-off you make when you do that is
that you actually decrease your
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This number, this is total non-structural
carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you increase your nitrogen,
your carbohydrate levels go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And particularly when we increase nitrogen
from fall foliar fertilizer, this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good way of getting nitrogen to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It decreases your carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's not a problem as long as you
have adequate carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have enough carbohydrate,
you can actually see your yields
[SPEAKER_02]: decreasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this graph here, we've increased our
nitrogen without fall foliar application.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we increase our nitrogen, our yields go
up the following year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we would expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we also increase nitrogen and we
fall foliar feed, we can get to the point
[SPEAKER_02]: where we get so much nitrogen in the plant
that our yields no longer keep going up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they actually fall back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because we're above the optimal
amount for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're starting to deplete our
carbohydrates to the point where the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: can't sustain itself during that spring
flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So down here, we have just sort of put it
all together, looking at the total amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of nitrogen in the plant going into the
fall and looking at the yield the
[SPEAKER_02]: following spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see that there is an optimal
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can exceed that with high
fertilizer rates in a growing year coupled
[SPEAKER_02]: with fall foliar fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to do too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you moderately fertilize in a
growing season and add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: fall fertilizer, you can be up in this
range here, which is good for yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a graph showing yields with fall
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is no fall foliar fertilizer and five
pounds of fall foliar fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see our yields jump quite a
bit, almost to the same level as where we
[SPEAKER_02]: put 30 pounds on in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess six times more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is with spring
nitrogen, we're getting softer fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to avoid the spring if we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we don't think the plants have
adequate nitrogen, a fall foliar
[SPEAKER_02]: application seems to be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the goal of nitrogen fertilization in
strawberries is to boost those nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: reserves so that it has them available for
flower production and early spring growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So late summer soil applications are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fall foliar applications are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spring nitrogen boosts vegetative growth a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants really grow a lot when you
fertilize in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have a big impact on yield
and it seems to soften the fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the summer foliar applications
also promotes vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem to translate into any
yield increase the following year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's that picture I showed earlier
about strawberries, ammonium forms in
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the roots are black.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just the opposite with
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrate forms, roots are just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: A mixture of both somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you force feed them ammonium,
this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that doesn't mean you can't use
ammonium sources of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that the ammonium fertilizers in
the soil get converted by the bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: into the nitrate form that the plant can
take up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead and you can use ammonium
sources of fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time you really want to do that
is if you fumigated the soil and you
[SPEAKER_02]: killed the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was nothing to convert the
ammonium fertilizer to the nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you might cause some toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in normal soils that haven't been
fumigated, you can use ammonium sources
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're generally cheaper than
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's look at some deficiency symptoms
in strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can maybe learn to recognize what
these plants might look like when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: short of certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now again, ideally with growers,
you would never want to get to the state
[SPEAKER_02]: where you see visible symptoms of
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would want to do a leaf analysis
regularly every two or three years so you
[SPEAKER_02]: could head off any deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you see visible symptoms,
then you know you're having an impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to head that off by monitoring
plenty of time ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaves sort of turn red.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a field of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see those red leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be late July, early August.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way too early for leaves to be
turning red on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is because this field was not
fertilized for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that we don't generally see
in the Northeast because we've got lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: acid rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our acid rain contains lots of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the plants, every time it rains,
they get fertilized with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tend not to see deficiency symptoms
of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we did, this is what it would look
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur is a component of a lot of amino
acids and proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nitrogen is part of amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you don't have sulfur,
this nitrogen can't be converted into
[SPEAKER_02]: amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the leaves are yellow instead of nice
and dark green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned we see this in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sometimes see this in strawberries as
well, particularly where we have standier
[SPEAKER_02]: soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing you see with potassium
deficiency is a little bit of browning
[SPEAKER_02]: around the bottom of this leaflet here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can see some burning on
the margins of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also get this funny color,
a little bit dark, modeled throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf from potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look at another picture of this up
close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the little bit of burning
along the edge of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a little bit of necrosis here
where the leaflets come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can see this little bit
darker color on the leaf than what looks
[SPEAKER_02]: normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often with potassium deficiency,
you see this on the older leaves first.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it on the older leaves first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is that potassium
and nitrogen are very mobile in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tend to be mobilized from the
older leaves into the new growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the new growth is a big sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything moves there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sugar moves there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The photosynthate, the nutrients all move
to the new growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It leaves the older leaves without any
nutrient because the nitrogen shot off to
[SPEAKER_02]: the sink and the potassium left and went
to the growing point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The older leaves show these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually in the field looking at
potassium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the marginal burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very typical of any plant with potassium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the marginal burning because
potassium is so important for water uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: and movement through the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Necrosis deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it would look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I've ever really seen
phosphorus deficiency in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our soils in New York tend to have lots of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least historically, growers have used
manure and that has lots of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just tend not to see a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you can test for it and see if
it's getting low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-plant phosphorus applications usually
take care of everything you might need for
[SPEAKER_02]: the rest of the life of your planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something that we generally
ever recommend growers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go out and apply phosphorus
fertilizer to an established field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if we did, phosphorus is not very
mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would take a couple of years before
it ever worked its way down into the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do a good job pre-plant and then you
don't have to worry about phosphorus ever
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phosphorus, you get that reddish color
is fairly characteristic of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now calcium deficiency, that's an
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium is also very important for
movement of water in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And calcium is transported through the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dissolved in the water and it's moved
through the transpiration stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really actively moved from cell
to cell like a lot of the other nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It moves up through the water and through
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have conditions that do not
favor movement of water in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you sometimes will get calcium deficiency
symptoms, usually at the extremities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the water isn't getting out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this plant here, you see this
browning at the tip and the leaf isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: unfolding properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown tip here, brown tip here,
brown tip here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the extremity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water is not moving through the plant
and you get that brown tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's analogous to blossom end rot of
tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly the same thing is happening except
here it's in the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to prevent calcium deficiency,
it's usually not, well I need to apply
[SPEAKER_02]: lime or more calcium to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually not the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: The solution is usually make sure the
water, the plant is well irrigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have situations where you let it
get really dry and you water lots and it
[SPEAKER_02]: get really dry again, you're likely to see
these symptoms develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is another extremity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a growing tip and it's already
starting to turn brown from the lack of
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, a runner tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the brown at the end of the
runner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the brown leaf here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see it in the extremities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Laura asked a question about how much
reduction in yield the field would be
[SPEAKER_02]: seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure what field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you could indicate what nutrient
we were talking about and I can give you
[SPEAKER_02]: some sense of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, it was the nitrogen one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering if you see something
like that, that's that profound,
[SPEAKER_00]: what could you tell the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much yield might he be losing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in a field like you saw there
without it being fertilized for a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of years, I wouldn't be surprised if you
could lose close to, you could be down
[SPEAKER_02]: about 50% over what you might normally
have with adequate fertilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrogen is a really important nutrient
for lots of things, but plant growth and
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without that, you don't get the flower bud
initiation that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that determines the number of fruits
you're going to have the following year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw this in blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is the one with a Christmas
tree-like shape in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we still, we also see interveinal
coloring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case here, unlike the
blueberry, it doesn't turn red.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sort of turns a dark, funky color.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's real severe, you'll get
brown between the veins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that interveinal necrosis or
coloring is often typical of magnesium
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually you find that when the soil pH is
getting too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the case of magnesium, it's not as
mobile in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you tend to see this on the newer
leaves first, as opposed to the older
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one way you can look at a plant
and kind of help narrow down what the
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mobile nutrients, you see the deficiency
first in older leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Immobile nutrients, you see it first in
younger leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So magnesium is not as mobile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the chlorophyll molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't move around as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of stays in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that in the younger leaves
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to bring to your attention,
I think your voice might be dropping a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit in volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe just getting a little closer to
the mic might help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll try to do better.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iron is also a component of chlorophyll
synthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorophyll is a big molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see the deficiencies in the younger
leaves first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you notice in this plant here,
the older leaves still look reasonably
[SPEAKER_02]: green.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the center leaves, the younger leaves
that are coming out are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a strawberry root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a healthy root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see lots of nice white roots,
lots of root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the next slide I'm going to show you
is boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boron is a nutrient that's responsible for
oxen synthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you remember from, you know,
biology class, oxen was responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you don't have cell elongation,
you have, you know, the meristems abort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you end up with stubby roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next slide is a picture of a
strawberry growing in a low boron
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the root hair is just sort of abort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're left with these stubby roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with stubby roots, you don't get very
good uptake of other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen time and time again
strawberry fields and raspberry fields,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, where the leaf analysis comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of things are low.
[SPEAKER_02]: But boron is also low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes, not always, but
oftentimes, if you correct that boron
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with a couple of pounds of actual
boron per acre and get those roots to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: again, the other deficiencies kind of
correct themselves because now the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: can take up those nutrients that it
couldn't otherwise because there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: decent root system under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look for boron frequently when I'm
looking at leaf analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the first things I look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, if you look at all the leaves
that were ever sent to Cornell in the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis, boron is the one that's most
commonly deficient in our leaf analyses
[SPEAKER_02]: that we analyze here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some leaf symptoms of boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asymmetrical leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is one kind of interesting,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, the fruit, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like maybe tarnished plant bug or
maybe poor pollination or frost injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, these little seeds on the
strawberry are called achines.
[SPEAKER_02]: They secrete oxen that causes the
receptacle tissue underneath it to expand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as those little achines are all
in gear, all pollinated and all secreting
[SPEAKER_02]: oxen, you get a really nice berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the plant can't make oxen,
then these berries can't expand very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get all these deformed berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, characteristic of severe boron
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the challenge with boron is that you
can also apply too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those that doesn't have a very
wide range of where it's either,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, deficient or toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to make sure you don't put
on too much or you'll get the burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The burning in this case, it looks very
much like potassium deficiency,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's actually boron toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also, you know, zinc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much zinc can cause, you know,
problems as well as too little.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the leaf analysis is so
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple of things on raspberries and
blackberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to go through the whole
feel like we did with blueberries and
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have the summer berry types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just some thoughts on nitrogen there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much nitrogen can lead to wintering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can fertilizing too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, with summer bearing
raspberries, we fertilize in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fertilize too late or use too much,
you'll get winter injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can see winter injury right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's killed the canes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new prima canes are growing just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the old canes aren't doing so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now fall bearing raspberry, since we
usually mow those down every year,
[SPEAKER_02]: too much nitrogen usually isn't an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And raspberries have a pretty extensive
root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're really good, efficient at
taking up nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can handle a lot more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grow more vigorously with more
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we fertilize in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can fertilize in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And combine the rates a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't have to worry about
going too late or putting on too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're just going to cut the canes
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a little bit of work on foliar
feeding of raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put on these foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we monitored the uptake of the foliar
spray into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used N15, which is sort of a tracer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not radioactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stable isotope of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can spray it on and watch it move
into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at various factors to see if
any factors might aid in the uptake of the
[SPEAKER_02]: urea that was late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at surfactants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at time of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at the pH of the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at plants that were stressed or
not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of the companies that sell
these products say, well, you didn't put
[SPEAKER_02]: them on at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or didn't have the right surfactant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were getting our standard treatment,
just mixing it with water and spraying on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was giving us almost 50% of the
nitrogen being absorbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost anything else we do either didn't
make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it actually reduced the uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think there's anything magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to use it, about half of it
goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the same thing looking at a
potassium analog.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we looked at rubidium,
which is in a periodic chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same valence as potassium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It behaves the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sprayed the rubidium on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked at uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our standard treatment was pretty much as
good as we could get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe putting it on early in the morning
was a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, it didn't make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with these foliar
applications, though, is that even though
[SPEAKER_02]: we get 50% uptake, you can only put on
about five pounds of actual urea per acre
[SPEAKER_02]: at any one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else you get toxicity to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the plant's only taken up 50% of
that, that's two and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth of the matter is not all of
that you spray on hits the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it just goes off into the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never really touches the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in actuality, you're probably only
really getting into the plant one or one
[SPEAKER_02]: and a half pounds of actual nitrogen with
every time you spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a very efficient way of
applying nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You almost have to spray every day to give
the plant the nitrogen it needs from
[SPEAKER_02]: foliar applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our data show that it doesn't make any
difference anyway when it's sprayed during
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time we're seeing a difference is
when it's sprayed late in the fall to
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to those nitrogen reserves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to wrap everything up, pre-plant
amendments are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Base these on soil test recommendations
from a reputable lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use leaf analysis to fine-tune your
fertilization and establish plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, not always, but generally
restrict nitrogen applications to the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although evidence exists of building
reserve nitrogen late fall can be helpful
[SPEAKER_02]: if carbohydrate status is adequate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize if there's some problem
with the audio for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded really good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that everyone else
is having good reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly would appreciate feedback
about how the quality of the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is your opportunity to ask
Marvin some questions about the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, I'm going to move into the final.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephanie has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephanie, I think you have a microphone
now if you have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could type the question in the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hearing from Stephanie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to type right down at the
bottom of the chat box, Stephanie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a microphone, you are
unable to ask the question right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Molly just asked a question about were
the last comments about foliar feeding for
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries or raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data I showed you on uptake was for
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: The data I showed you on the actual yield
response for fall foliar fertilization was
[SPEAKER_02]: for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But strawberries and raspberries are
fairly closely related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time when people do these
studies, they find that strawberries and
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberries generally spawn the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't be surprised if we did those
same studies that we did on strawberries
[SPEAKER_02]: with fall foliar applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that to raspberries, whether we
would see the same response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lai-Lang Chung here in the department has
done those studies on grapes and apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's found the exact same thing,
that late fall foliar reapplications
[SPEAKER_02]: increased nitrogen reserves and improved
yields the following year, provided that
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrate levels are not too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see why raspberries would be any
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, there was a question from Dan
Welch about differences in nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: day-neutral strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So day-neutral strawberries are quite
different than the regular perennial
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have very shallow root systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They allocate only about 10% of their
growth to roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty low compared to like a
raspberry where it's 50% or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have these really shallow roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't go out very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with day-neutral strawberries,
you really do have to spoon feed those
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen almost all season long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we recommend about one pound of actual
nitrogen a day for day-neutral
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries during the growing season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you don't have to fertilize them
every day unless you're set up to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could put a pound of nitrogen through
the irrigation system once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't recommend going more than
about seven days before you do apply that
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to do it weekly,
seven pounds every week would be
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent to one pound a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they need that much to get them
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you add that up over the entire
season, they're using more nitrogen than a
[SPEAKER_02]: regular strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably shouldn't say they're using
more, but they just need a lot of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: around because their roots aren't really
very good at sequestering what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you spoon feed them and about one pound
a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other nutrients, potassium,
phosphorus and all, that's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you put enough in the ground
before you plant, then you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're grown mostly as annuals
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a big deal with
day-neutrals, but the nitrogen is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have to worry for most part
about fall fuller applications because
[SPEAKER_02]: most people are not overwintering their
day-neutrals anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they would, it would probably have
the same response as a Juneberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig, thank you very much for answering
that one question.
[SPEAKER_00]: These series have all been recorded,
and this one will also be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recorded today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will open them up to the general
public shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will be able to get them and
recommend them to growers if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank Dr. Pritz for taking the
time today and earlier in this session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Greg Loeb and Courtney Weber,
because they were the other speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit different presentation
style, and I really appreciate them taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to learn how to do it and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank all of you for
joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wouldn't be any good if we
didn't have anybody listening and asking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to ask if you folks wouldn't
mind just taking one quick exit poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll deliver this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give us a little feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a multiple answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll just read the questions as
they're numbered and then answer them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to hit a submit or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be able to have that data to
help us evaluate the sessions and then
[SPEAKER_00]: also maybe move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move forward with some other webcast
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then unless you have any other
questions for Marvin after this poll is
[SPEAKER_00]: done, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much everybody that I expected to
weigh in has weighed in, and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have anything else to add,
please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
