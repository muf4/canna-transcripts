[SPEAKER_03]: Issues or concerns that they've had with
what they've been doing in order to do
[SPEAKER_03]: deep zone killing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I got that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I see it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there particular photos either of you
would like to put up there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one of mine there is 13 or 20.
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 is my little tiller.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, you did have pictures up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you you did have pictures up there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, that's the only one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also have an unreferred.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a six row unreferred for my main
crops because I'm primarily a grain
[SPEAKER_14]: grower.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I built that two row for my
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a pretty simple little machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you can tell right there,
it works awfully good.
[SPEAKER_14]: As long as you have your cover crop or
clean ground ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, that's a field that had
rye in it was sprayed in the fall.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I use that for strawberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm doing that about the first week in
April or the last week in March as soon as
[SPEAKER_14]: I can get in the field to get it ready so
I can plant my strawberries in April.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all it is is two chisel shanks and
then two sets of closing, covering for
[SPEAKER_14]: colters on the back to shape up a ridge.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a two row machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: I pull it about 13 or 14 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm pulling it with a 30 horsepower
tractor right there is all.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's no fancy equipment on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that would have to be
different if I had a heavy cover crop
[SPEAKER_14]: ahead of time, I'd need a colter in front
of that to cut through.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a toolbar in the front there I
made so I could put one on.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I've never needed it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've only got just the chisels in the
middle and the colters in the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how deep are the chisels?
[SPEAKER_14]: About 13 or 14 inches.
[SPEAKER_14]: No fertilizer or anything on.
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be easy to put a little tank on there
and run a hose with a nozzle down the back
[SPEAKER_14]: of each chisel point.
[SPEAKER_14]: You could put fertilizer eight inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you were going to grow sweet corn or
some other crop that needed nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_14]: you could put it on with that eight inches
or so.
[SPEAKER_14]: Put about half your nitrogen on early with
that and then put the other half on top
[SPEAKER_14]: when you plant your crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't need it for the berries,
so I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then where is an unreferred slide,
Betsy?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: My machine isn't in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Betsy, where is an unreferred slide?
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 16 looks like a good bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: One above it too, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_14]: That one there, that might be an
unreferred.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_14]: That one is.
[SPEAKER_14]: The one above it, nine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an unreferred machine.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's like mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the advantages, disadvantages of that?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the only difference between that and
mine, I've replaced those baskets on the
[SPEAKER_14]: back with cul-de-packer rollers,
cul-de-packer wheels.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it makes a little more,
it makes a better row to plant in because
[SPEAKER_14]: it firms the soil a little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that machine because it's got the
straight shanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: All we're trying to do with that is to
make a slot in the ground that the plant
[SPEAKER_14]: roots can follow down below the compacted
layers.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that better than the parabolic
shanks because the parabolic shanks pull
[SPEAKER_14]: up more stones than that will.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're in a stony situation,
that machine is a cleaner one to run.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been using mine for 15 years and it
takes about half as much power to pull it
down.
[SPEAKER_14]: But now, as it did when I started,
it gets better and better every single
[SPEAKER_14]: year.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I'm to the point now on my gravel
and good loam ground, I don't do that
[SPEAKER_14]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just strip till plant on top of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the heavier ground, heavy clay,
I still do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I put cul-de-packer wheels on the back
to break the clods up and do a little
[SPEAKER_14]: compaction on the row to firm it up before
I'm going to plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: I prefer to do it in the fall if somebody
needed to know when, in which case I take
[SPEAKER_14]: that back piece right off.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need to firm the slot and I don't
need to use the basket.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just have the closing discs and the
big shank in the front in the fall and
[SPEAKER_14]: then let Mother Nature take care of
firming up the row and then just go in and
[SPEAKER_14]: plant on it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I prefer to do it in the fall if I have
a choice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Loosen the ground and get that slot made
so that freezing and thawing and whatever
[SPEAKER_14]: will take care of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you have to do it in the spring,
then you need either that basket or
[SPEAKER_14]: cul-de-packer wheels or something on the
back or the soil is going to be too loose
[SPEAKER_14]: to plant in.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you can plant in it, but it's better
if you put something on the back there.
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't really break up the clods
that well.
[SPEAKER_13]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: George did mine before I started.
[SPEAKER_13]: He and I talked about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, I wonder what would happen if you
put a cul-de-packer wheel on there because
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got cloudier ground than he does.
[SPEAKER_13]: Works better.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he did it afterwards and that seemed
to be the answer for breaking the clods
[SPEAKER_13]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially in that we had a dry year
and then we really wanted people to go to
[SPEAKER_05]: the cul-de-packer to seal that moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it was wet, then the basket's okay
because it'll probably break the clods up
[SPEAKER_14]: if it's wet anyway.
[SPEAKER_14]: The question in two things, in the heavy
ground, which is where that thing really
[SPEAKER_14]: is needed, you're going to get clods.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you get clods, you've got to do
something with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't just leave them there to dry out
and get hard and then try to plant through
[SPEAKER_14]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the basket will break up,
your clod's fine and dandy.
[SPEAKER_14]: If it won't, the cul-de-packer wheels will
do a better job of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But if it's really, really wet,
you're going to get too much with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you've got to take the spring off and
do everything to keep it so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_14]: push down quite so hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a question every year,
what the ground is like, what kind of soil
[SPEAKER_14]: is it, what fields you're in.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't do it the same way in every
field every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to be able to make some
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the shank, the cutting disc in the
front, the shank, and then the two closing
[SPEAKER_14]: discs stay the same no matter where you
are.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all you use in the fall and that's
another reason I like to do it in the fall
[SPEAKER_14]: because it's generally drier in the fall.
[SPEAKER_14]: The soil's in better condition and you're
not worried about it wet in the spring
[SPEAKER_14]: because if you do it in the fall,
make your row in the fall, it'll dry out
[SPEAKER_14]: in the spring if it's a wet spring all by
itself and the clods will be gone from
[SPEAKER_14]: mother nature.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you don't have to deal with those
issues if you do your deep till or you're
[SPEAKER_14]: ripping in the fall.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a better way to go.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that I've kind of toyed
with the idea of adding to mine was a set
[SPEAKER_13]: of trash cleaners in front of the ripper
point.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just when we're using the one row setter
to set either seeds or transplants,
[SPEAKER_13]: trash can be a problem if you let it get
too tall and even if you kill it round up,
[SPEAKER_13]: if you let it get woody at all,
you can spray it when it's in a grass
[SPEAKER_13]: single blade form or you're going to run
into problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we've got... What slide is that that
you're referring to here now with the
[SPEAKER_05]: trash wheel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me, Carol?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's number eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number eight, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I built my unit, I didn't leave
enough room to put any stuff on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really think about pre-row.
[SPEAKER_13]: I was trying to get a real aggressive
point on a thing to get down deep and I've
[SPEAKER_13]: tried to put stuff after it and it doesn't
really work.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I could probably put a set of row
cleaners right before my hillardus in the
[SPEAKER_13]: back.
[SPEAKER_13]: That could possibly work or run the
hillardus and then run these after.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've looked at the thing several different
ways and I've got it set pretty good so it
[SPEAKER_13]: works well the way it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've never really taken the time to
mess with putting these things on.
[SPEAKER_14]: See, those in that picture are like my
planter.
[SPEAKER_14]: You put those on the front of your
planter.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm wondering why you couldn't put
those on the front of your transplanter.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where they belong.
[SPEAKER_14]: You clean that row just before you get
right there with the transplanter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but don't you have to go like five
miles an hour or something that they can
[SPEAKER_13]: work?
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll work that slow on a transplanter?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm not sure they work.
[SPEAKER_08]: At a half a mile an hour?
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got to have those treader wheels
on the side, depth wheels, so they don't
[SPEAKER_14]: go too deep.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: The floating ones will never make a gouge,
a trench.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Too many get complex topography and hills
sideways and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will gouge on you sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you go too fast or you have too deep
and then you end up with a depression with
[SPEAKER_05]: all this junk on the side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Collects water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it collects water and it's murder if
you've got processing snap beans or dry
[SPEAKER_05]: beans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because your row is starting below the
level of the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Snap beans need to have that mini-mount
still intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Carol and Jim and Lynn and George,
I have this picture up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Anu of the trash wheels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do know that Umber Firth has made an
adapt.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have created a mounting unit in front
of the cutting disk that you can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: put trash things in.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, well, that's where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on the disk.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right in front of the cutting disk,
they've made a unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to make sure folks knew about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we move around for questions,
I wanted to see if Lynn, you had any other
[SPEAKER_03]: comments on how you got started?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, basically, I was struggling on
either dry years or excessively dry years
[SPEAKER_13]: or excessively wet years.
[SPEAKER_13]: My ground would pond on a wet year and on
a dry year, nothing would grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of what got me started into
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And between a little urgent from George
and Gary Sweet, we had tried zone tillage
[SPEAKER_13]: without any ripping.
[SPEAKER_13]: First year I tried it, I thought that's
where I had to go because it was
[SPEAKER_13]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a rain right after I planted.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything came out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: The pumpkins were beautiful that year.
[SPEAKER_13]: The next year I expanded.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I had George plant my winter squash
and pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a total failure.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so dry that year.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plants didn't germinate.
[SPEAKER_13]: When they did germinate, they really
didn't grow well.
[SPEAKER_13]: The missing ingredient seemed to be the
ripping and making that slot, giving it a
[SPEAKER_13]: place to grow.
[SPEAKER_13]: The following year, if you go back to your
pictures there, I started out with a one
[SPEAKER_13]: shank ripper.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just a subsoiler I had that I used
for drainage.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's picture number six.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my first experiment right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: I took that, went down through,
and I ripped four rows.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the middle of a tomato field on a clay
knoll where nothing would grow anyway.
[SPEAKER_13]: With the attitude that if nothing,
if it doesn't work, well, nothing was
[SPEAKER_13]: going to grow there anyway, so I'm really
not out anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: I went through with that, then followed up
with a, a cub with the hillardice on it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We went back and forth through a couple
times, sprayed the clods up, used a
[SPEAKER_13]: conventional transplant or planted into
it.
[SPEAKER_13]: First thing I noticed was the transplant
had worked better than it ever had before.
[SPEAKER_13]: We were planting on that mound,
a nice soft mound.
[SPEAKER_13]: Second thing I noticed was, again,
it was, it started out to be a really dry
[SPEAKER_13]: spring.
[SPEAKER_13]: The transplants hit the ground and just
started running from the minute they hit
[SPEAKER_13]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: The plants looked way better than the
tomato plants on either side of the four
[SPEAKER_13]: rows, the test strip, all season long.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, here's the, they grew faster.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked like I had, you know,
used a different fertilizer program or
[SPEAKER_13]: something.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything was the same.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had pitchers somewhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't, I don't know if we have them here
today or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the, the final result with the,
the yield difference was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_13]: Quality, everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: The tomatoes were bigger, there was more
tomatoes on a plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was, that's what got me started,
and I've been experimenting ever since.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a pitcher 28 or 21 or
something.
[SPEAKER_13]: The following year, I built a two row
unit, which included the hillardice,
[SPEAKER_13]: tried to do everything in one pass.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in the PTT you sent us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but she cut some, so there wouldn't
be so many.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: But similar to George's actually,
the only difference is I've got straight
[SPEAKER_13]: shanks on mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've got a, a set of spider wheels
that run behind the ripper, ripper shank
[SPEAKER_13]: to kind of break up the clods.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does roll some of the sod and stuff
out of the way a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's followed up by two
hillardice that are the concave
[SPEAKER_13]: hillardice, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: To throw a nice, the mound I throw is
probably like eight to ten inches high.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like a good high mound, so after it
settles, you've still got a mound there.
[SPEAKER_13]: But every experiment that I've done with
this so far has been positive.
[SPEAKER_13]: From planting four rows, I take that two
row ripper and go out in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_13]: ten acre corn field and rip four rows,
plant directly into it.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can drive across the end of the field
on a pickup truck.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't even get out of the truck.
[SPEAKER_13]: The corn is six inches to a foot taller
than the corn on both sides of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, I haven't had one bad
experience with it yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems, for me, it's been the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you've had a significant compaction
problem.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: On a light soil.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't perk at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not unusual on vegetable soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tillage pans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, so I, I wanted to just add it
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to take a, a, a minute to go
around all the locations and see if we had
[SPEAKER_03]: any questions, because we wanted to move
on to some of the growers on Long Island
[SPEAKER_03]: who have used different equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we move on, I'm going to just
add, look at the growers that are here
[SPEAKER_03]: with us in the room in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any questions for George?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: George, when you, when you till in the
fall, do you have a hard time finding your
[SPEAKER_01]: rows in the spring?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because I end up with about a six
inch, six to seven inch wide clean tilled
[SPEAKER_14]: strip there with a mound and it still
visible in the spring.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you have to do fall weed control
is the best option for zone tillage
[SPEAKER_14]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the strips are still there in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one more question from Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you doing that zone tilling in the
fall into a cover crop that will winter
[SPEAKER_12]: kill or into a rye that's still alive in
the spring?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: Both, a lot of it is into soybean ground
that's going to go back to sweet corn or
[SPEAKER_14]: something.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there isn't any cover crop there.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too late.
[SPEAKER_14]: I may plant rye, but then I do the deep
till early enough that the rise is barely
[SPEAKER_14]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_14]: It comes up afterwards and then we have to
kill it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, but I've done it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, like I, for my pumpkins,
I usually do it either very late in the
[SPEAKER_14]: fall or very early in the spring in the
standing rye.
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I don't have a problem getting
through the rye or seeing the rows when I
[SPEAKER_14]: get ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's killed rye.
[SPEAKER_13]: You won't, you won't want to try to plant
into a green rye.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you don't want to plant in anything
green if you can help it.
[SPEAKER_13]: That side, it'll just, it'll make a mess
and it'll ball up and you've got to kill
[SPEAKER_13]: that crop.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever you plan into, make sure it's
dead.
[SPEAKER_14]: If that, if that zone builder has a good
cutting disc ahead of that shank,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can zone build through anything.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can't plant through anything
green.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to make sure everything is dead
when you get there with a planter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Takes about a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to spray, what I found is three
weeks to four weeks before.
[SPEAKER_13]: Three weeks, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we move on to Long Island?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions for George or Lynn?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead and ask a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've got a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of plant, what kind of planter
are you using?
[SPEAKER_14]: Me?
[SPEAKER_13]: John Deere, John Deere 7000.
[SPEAKER_13]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I also use a conventional, it's an old,
new idea, transplanter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I use that, then I have a newer style with
the finger pickup for the transplants
[SPEAKER_13]: also.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's nothing, I've done nothing,
no modifications to the transplanters.
[SPEAKER_13]: We just, if you build a clean mound,
that's something I failed to mention
[SPEAKER_13]: earlier too.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to have seasons where you may
have to go back over that where you
[SPEAKER_13]: ripped.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a two row ripper, I will go through
it one direction.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I don't have a nice clean seed bed,
I will turn around and go back the
[SPEAKER_13]: opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the same time, and that usually does
enough that it breaks up the clods and
[SPEAKER_13]: clears up the, gives you a nice clean seed
bed, a nice mound to plant into.
[SPEAKER_13]: Make sure it looks good.
[SPEAKER_13]: You want it to look the way, you got to be
happy with the way it looks or you won't
[SPEAKER_13]: be happy with the end result.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just make sure you got a clean place to
start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions from Long Island?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm just wondering about having a
rolling basket followed by a pulse packer
[SPEAKER_04]: or some of our growers have tried two
rolling baskets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to have a really good bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would be zone building in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think of those ideas?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any reason it wouldn't work.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've not done that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've either had the basket or the
cul-de-packer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't had both, but it should be all
right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the key is to have the
cul-de-packer one place or the other.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you get the firming up of that row if
you're going to do it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have very long for mother nature
to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you want to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, let's move to Jeff Miller.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_16]: One is, there was a comment made that
someone doing the ripping along with the
[SPEAKER_16]: zone building after a period of time was
able to not do that ripping anymore.
[SPEAKER_16]: How long did it take before you got to
that point?
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm at the point.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Each field is different.
[SPEAKER_14]: My heavy ground, I still do the ripping,
the heavy clay, because it just seals up
[SPEAKER_14]: so hard every year.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I haven't done any ripping on some
gravelly loam around where I live probably
[SPEAKER_14]: for the last, oh, I'd say five years.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been doing zone tillage for 15 or
16 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I probably could have quit quicker.
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray Rossum, when I started, tried to tell
everybody that you could do it two years
[SPEAKER_14]: in a row.
[SPEAKER_14]: You do your ripping one year, and then you
split the middles the second year.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you don't have to do it anymore
as long as you don't mess the soil up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he may have been right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I never had nerve enough to do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I probably went six or seven or eight
years before I quit doing the ripping on
[SPEAKER_14]: the good soil.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the heavy clay, I still rip every
year.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the second question is,
you have a John Deere 7000.
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a gang of coulters in front of
each planter row?
[SPEAKER_16]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: Up until this year, I've had the old
Unverfirth cart that had a tank and
[SPEAKER_14]: coulters on the cart.
[SPEAKER_14]: Three coulters in front of each planter
row.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got the coulters to the row and
pulled the planter behind it.
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, I'm going to have a set of
trash wheels, like you saw in that other
[SPEAKER_14]: picture on the front, with a single disc
fertilizer applicator off to one side for
[SPEAKER_14]: each row.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I won't use the cart anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The cart was needed when I started because
if you put the coulters on the planter 15
[SPEAKER_14]: years ago, you couldn't get the planter in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: The ground was too hard.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got the cart, which you could put 500
gallons of fertilizer in, or water or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever, for weight.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you could get the thing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm to the point now I don't have any
problem anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: So from now on, I won't use the cart.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the same 7000 planter.
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a no-till coulter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one coulter in front of each row.
[SPEAKER_13]: It does a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two neighbors that have switched to
zone-till, no-till, if you want to call it
[SPEAKER_14]: that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of them have Kinsey planters.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they started with a coulter like the
one that's in that picture there,
[SPEAKER_14]: a single cutting coulter in the front.
[SPEAKER_14]: No-till coulter with a fertilizer unit on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't do the deep ripping
anymore.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in the same shape I'm in.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're grain producers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have a lot of trouble with that
getting the planter in the ground.
[SPEAKER_14]: So everybody around me has taken the
no-till coulter off.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the fertilizer opener, they've gone to
a smooth, straight slicer disc for the
[SPEAKER_14]: fertilizer opener so that they don't have
trouble with those openers holding the
[SPEAKER_14]: planter up out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we move then last to
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy, do you have any questions from
growers at your site?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any questions on these folks'
equipment situation?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me hand off the mic here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was George who said he only
goes 13 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that really adequate to get the plow
pan on your fields?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because here, our fields have been farmed
about 350 years and packed continually.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to go down 17 or 18 inches to
get below it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, what I was talking about was that
two-row one that I built for my
[SPEAKER_14]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no compaction layers in that field
because I've zoned tilled for years.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I go down 12 or 13 inches when I plant
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_14]: The big machine that's the regular
unreferred for planting soybeans or sweet
[SPEAKER_14]: corn or pumpkins, I go about 17 or 18
inches in the clay.
[SPEAKER_14]: In the fields where I have done it a
number of years and I don't have any
[SPEAKER_14]: compaction anymore, again, I still only go
down 10 or 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no reason to go any deeper if you
don't have a density layer and it pulls a
[SPEAKER_14]: heck of a lot easier 10 inches deep than
it does 18.
[SPEAKER_14]: So once you've done it a few years,
you can quit going so deep if you don't
[SPEAKER_14]: mess it up and go back in there with a
plow or a disc or something and put a
[SPEAKER_14]: layer back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to measure your compaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a penetrometer or a tile rod or
something so you can detect where your
[SPEAKER_05]: compaction layer is so you can rip just a
little deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other questions here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lynn, I'm sorry I cut you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a comment?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I just started to say I check every
field.
[SPEAKER_13]: I go around once or twice and I jump off
and take the penetrometer and I'll check
[SPEAKER_13]: in the rip and make sure I'm breaking
through the hard pan.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I determine how deep I have to
go in each field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So most of the time, I just run it all the
way down.
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can tell I just kind of listen to
the tractor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some fields, you can tell it's pulling a
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just jump off and check in.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I don't have to run it as deep,
I will tend to pick it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we want to do is... We've got
one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get it one more time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually, I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question would be, assuming it's dry
enough in the spring, is there any good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason not to do the no tillage
preparation in the spring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because conventionally on Long Island,
we have sandy loam soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do field preparation the season
before in the fall, we have wind or water
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do all of mine in the spring.
[SPEAKER_13]: I cover crop with rye on just about all of
my ground.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, like I said, three weeks to
four weeks before I'm going to rip,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go through and spray with Roundup and
then go back through and do my tillage.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's been a pretty good combination
for me.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have a problem with spring as long
as you can do the ripping.
[SPEAKER_14]: Two or three weeks ahead of when you're
going to plant to let that row get healed
[SPEAKER_14]: up.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you put the cul-de-pac around the
back, you'll do a little better job.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is that slot will stay open
and you'll have loose soil for a while,
[SPEAKER_14]: for a short period after you do it,
until you get a heavy rain or until it
[SPEAKER_14]: just naturally settles in.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't like it in the spring if you've
got to do it right away and then try to
[SPEAKER_14]: plant right afterwards.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a trial in Wayne County with Mike
Stanier some years ago on beans.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the guy ripped today and he planted
beans.
[SPEAKER_14]: He planted the beans tomorrow and they
were terrible because he's planting beans
[SPEAKER_14]: in a one inch wide slot.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's nothing but a big air pocket.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to either do it in the fall or do
it far enough ahead in the spring so it
[SPEAKER_14]: heals up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a pair of mutes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have Thomas on?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see him on yet.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so we wanted to move to Long
Island because we had growers that were
[SPEAKER_03]: using some slightly different,
some different equipment there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do we have Jen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're here Anu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did make, I did put all of the
pictures for our Jen's set up on a
[SPEAKER_03]: PowerPoint and I think Betsy sent that out
this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put it up on our screen as well so
you can all see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead Jen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for the pictures so I
know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, this is Thomas, I am connected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay Thomas, we'll be right with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a no-till grain drill that we
purchased, the sunflower, seven foot wide,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven and a half foot wide so that we can
no-till cover crops into the fields that
[SPEAKER_02]: we are resting for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow pumpkins specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: One year at rest, one year is in pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of our biggest problems is
phytophthora and keeping it away because
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have enough ground to rotate in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to build up the soil to
protect itself against the phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the no-till drill has given us some
options to try other cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: This past year we tried oats and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it going down the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that it does a nice job in
the field without tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also used it to plant sorghum,
sudan grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And third we planted our rye in the fall,
which is about three bushels to the acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we used the rye in the springtime
as the mulch for the pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is our zone builder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was earlier in the season when we
were just testing it out and we had what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're called the shark tooth reduced
residue managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're in the front of the colter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also had shark tooth behind
the colter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found we had about four bushels of
rye to the acre this past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of residue on the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that even the two sets of
shark teeth residue managers were not
[SPEAKER_02]: clearing enough to make a nice zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did was we got more aggressive
residue managers behind the colter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there should be another picture that
might be the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really see it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was earlier in the season there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the two shark teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right there, there's hardly any
residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the pictures previous, that's where we
had a ton of residue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found that putting the more
aggressive residue managers behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: colter really helped push more of the rye
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was our first year using this zone
builder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally, we've used a water wheel
transplanter to transplant our pumpkins
[SPEAKER_02]: directly into the rye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were noticing that there wasn't as
good of a stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't growing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we knew that they needed more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this zone built up a nice 8-inch zone
with fluffy soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they grew very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need some more time to perfect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are some of the strips that you can
see that we prepared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made a nice little zone there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the amount of residue in
between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of residue there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even with all of that residue,
though, we had some trouble with weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the questions that we
have is weed management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put tea tape down so that we can
water and also fertilize with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one of our questions is
fertilizer inside this zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are the weeds taking away from the
fertilizer and how we can compete with the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two issues in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's taking care of the weeds and also
knowing if we need to do something
[SPEAKER_02]: different with our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point in time, we have purchased a
John Deere planter, a Pequa planter,
[SPEAKER_02]: corn planter that we would like to try
seeding the pumpkins in the ground rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than transplant planning because it would
take a lot less time and labor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's any other
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you manage the rye?
[SPEAKER_07]: You said you got a lot of rye there.
[SPEAKER_07]: When did you cut it?
[SPEAKER_07]: At what stage did you cut it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how did you get it that manageable?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried several different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried cutting it tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried cutting it short.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a flail chopper that we've used.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had difficulty with that when it's
gotten too tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use a rotary mower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll cut it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go through and fluff it up
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're really interested in is
rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just a roller that we used to roll
our lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried rolling some of the rye.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seemed to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we found that you can't go in the same
direction that you are with the zone
[SPEAKER_02]: building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, that rye just wraps right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're considering trying this year
going crossways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we didn't know if anybody had any
experience with the rollers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there are rollers available that
we've seen on the front of tractors right
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of their planter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go through and roll and plant
right at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're interested in that as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We rolled high rye with a color packer and
planted right in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pumpkins came up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we had problems with fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen, I wanted to see if there was any
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions from Massachusetts?
[SPEAKER_03]: From any of the growers there with the
system?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Wally Zajkowski.
[SPEAKER_15]: We try and plant in as big a rye as
possible.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't cul-de-pac it or roll it or
anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just spray it with Roundup.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's usually in the headstand.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't do it on the stage when we do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to be really, really dry when we're
working it, though.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you don't tangle up.
[SPEAKER_15]: When it's wet, it's like wire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the advantage to not going to rye
down?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you answer that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I can answer it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But give me a half a day to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding is if you let it drop,
and I've heard that from Steve Groff that
[SPEAKER_04]: it falls in various directions and so it's
harder to plant into.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've done is we roll and then we
hit it with Roundup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just to keep the drift down.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you could run a zone builder
through large rye.
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you're looking to build a zone,
that might be a problem.
[SPEAKER_17]: The person from Yetter that we talked with
used the analogy.
[SPEAKER_17]: You couldn't comb your hair if one end
wasn't fastened.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so rolling it down gives the zone
builder more of an opportunity to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if you could kill the rye when
it's standing and go through the zone
[SPEAKER_07]: builder when it's standing without
knocking it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then you don't get that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once you knock it down, even if you go
straight, you still get that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not perfectly straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You still get that mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's standing, you're not going to
get that mixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's upright.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be able to go through it with a
machine and make your zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about after with a planter,
though?
[SPEAKER_07]: The cedar or the transplanter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cedar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cedar would go right through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're not going to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do we have any other questions from
Massachusetts?
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not going to knock the rye down,
doesn't it affect the light getting to the
[SPEAKER_11]: crop of pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_13]: It knocks down when you plant it,
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: The wheels of the tractor will run it
over, and it'll knock most of it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: We found, George does it, and I do it,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Leave it standing and go through that way.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let the wheels of the tractor knock it
down, both between your deep tillage and
[SPEAKER_13]: your planting.
[SPEAKER_13]: It opens it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: It knocks probably 85%, 90% of it down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then the rest falls.
[SPEAKER_13]: Within a couple of weeks, it'll fall down.
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks good after you've finished.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's really dead, the cold drill cuts.
[SPEAKER_14]: The key is you've got to get the roundup
on the rye far enough ahead so it's dead
[SPEAKER_14]: when you go to plant it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with Lynn.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I can get through it with a zone
builder and a planter much better if I
[SPEAKER_14]: haven't rolled it.
[SPEAKER_14]: The one year that I did try rolling it
that it got too big, you have to go the
[SPEAKER_14]: same way with the roller.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't go backwards or it all balls up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't roll my field precisely enough to
know exactly where my planter's going to
[SPEAKER_14]: go.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had big trouble that year.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you just kill it when it's about 24
inches tall or 30 inches high and let it
[SPEAKER_14]: fall down, and you've done it three weeks
before you're going to plant pumpkins,
[SPEAKER_14]: your planter and the deep teller won't
have any trouble going through there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if you go the same direction,
it still tends to wind up on the wheels of
[SPEAKER_13]: the planter.
[SPEAKER_13]: I found it's far better to just leave it
standing when you go through it.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't seem to ball up at all.
[SPEAKER_13]: Once in a while, you get some,
but for the most part, it won't plug your
[SPEAKER_13]: wheels up.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you don't have to get back and chop
that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Lynn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we are behind schedule,
I'm going to ask folks to hold their
[SPEAKER_03]: questions for Jen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll come back to that.
