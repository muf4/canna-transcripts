[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my pleasure to be able to speak with
you and tell you the work that I have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work mainly focuses on plant virus
movement and the image transmission.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, the plant virus is very small
with a very small genome and the JAPT
[SPEAKER_00]: encoding less than 10, 13, however,
the virus life cycle requires very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: activities and the virus has evolved a lot
of complex mechanisms to ensure that all
[SPEAKER_00]: the activities can be performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I'm going to tell you about
three things from potato leaf virus that
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate a multi-activity that are very
crucial for the virus survival in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potato leaf virus is a polio virus
genius in the family of Lutea viridae.
[SPEAKER_00]: The natural host of the virus is potato,
and it can also infect several other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, such as perinitis, shit,
dizziness, tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical symptom after infection with
this virus is de-growing, tubulence,
[SPEAKER_00]: necrosis, and also the chlorosis on the
infected leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This virus is flown, referred,
and transmitted by acid in a persistent
[SPEAKER_00]: manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm showing you a picture that we
construct a virus-induced gene-syncing
[SPEAKER_00]: vector using the leaf virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we science the TDS, we can see a
lot of branch areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, that area represents the look-alike
of the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The virus is really flown-linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the genome structure of the leaf
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a monopatite linear signal
string on a virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the whole genome can transcribe
two subgenomic on a subgenomic ion-1,
[SPEAKER_00]: subgenomic ion-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This simple genome uses many translational
strategies to incur its proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the read-through mechanism,
ring-shaped, they keep gaining internal
[SPEAKER_00]: rapsiderm intersides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, my talk will mainly focus on the
read-through mechanism and the proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: incurred from the subgenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subgenomic ion-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the subgenomic ion-1 is called its
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several open reading frames
around the subgenomic ion-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the OR3, being called a code protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the major testase protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole virus is composed with 180
code proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this protein has been reported to this
party in virus transmission and movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the OR4, being called a movement
protein, this protein is related to virus
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, cell-to-cell movement,
and systemic movement in the front first.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the OR5, there is RTD domain,
named as read-through domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This domain contains two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the very conserved and terminus
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is the very viral domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This domain has been reported to this
party in virus transmission, also this
[SPEAKER_00]: party in the virus movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the read-through protein, RTP is the
read-through of the Cp stop protein and
[SPEAKER_00]: generating a very large protein,
about 75 kilo darts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein has been very extensively
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein is on the surface of the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this is the RTD domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the outline of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the part one, I will introduce the
translational read-through process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discovered a downstream translation
enhancer, the structure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational enhancer, is critical for
translation, or RTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the translational enhancer and the
state gene-rich element, the interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between these two domains is very
important for read-through protein
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the part two, I will introduce the
read-through protein section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the proposed working model for
read-through was stop coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: When translation happens in stop coding,
the release factor will come and will
[SPEAKER_00]: arrive in the stop coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the write-down will get released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the translation will get termination.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when formation of very complex
vector structure near the stop coding will
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit the release factor coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the read-through protein or stop
coding will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this does mean write-through
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pre-release work 20 years ago,
using a related binary even graphed wire,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that there are two domains named
state gene-rich region, adjacent to state
[SPEAKER_00]: gene stop coding, and translational
enhancer, located within the RTD domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTD domains are very important for
read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they deleted these two domains,
the RTD protein couldn't be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is no further information
about the mechanism and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: write-through are regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's later unknown as of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our research, we will first study
the mechanism design between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, to discover whether there is a
translational enhancer in our informer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a serious mutation was constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that when we, under the RTD
expression, was detected by western blood
[SPEAKER_00]: using the agro-infiltrated fundamental
leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we deleted the nucleotide from the
4854, the RTP translation was severely
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we deleted the nucleotide
from 4933 or from the 5007, the
[SPEAKER_00]: translational read-through protein is
later detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although by in frame deletion,
we found that the nucleotide between the
[SPEAKER_00]: 4854 to 4933 is the minimal region for the
read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these readings are considered as the
translational enhancer of the informers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to add, the translational enhancer
section is determined by the nucleotide in
[SPEAKER_00]: the translational enhancer of the amino
acid recorded from this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a stop code then was introduced before
the translational enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And making the nucleotide after this will
not be translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, the RTP was detected with the
truncated RTP, indicating that the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleotide in this region is dis mined the
read-through translation, not the amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid translated by the translational
enhancer domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a direct RTP mutant, which all the
nucleotide after the CT stop coding was
[SPEAKER_00]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mutant was used as a net to
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: As shown in this figure, we couldn't find
any RTP that read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, the nucleotide, an argument of
homologous translation enhancer sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: among cell polyvirus, was carried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the nucleotide similarity is
very low, and it's less than 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we looked at the secondary structure of
this region, we found that the secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several double loops in this
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So previous work on other systems found
that the double loop structure is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important for read-through or stop coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to study the double loop structure,
in our section in our read-through
[SPEAKER_00]: translation, we focused on starting three
double loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double loop one, double loop two,
and double loop three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started these double loops
separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: For double loop one, we introduced two
mutants, which the stir will be opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the RTP translation was detected by a
weapon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the translation was severely
impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we made a complement of the
sequence here and made the stir closed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found that the RTP translation will
catch the worst translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we introduced another mutant,
which the loop of the double loop one was
[SPEAKER_00]: closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the RTP translation was also impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this start here suggests that the
double loop structure one is necessary for
[SPEAKER_00]: RTP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also studied the double loop two and
double loop three on the section of our
[SPEAKER_00]: read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there is no effect on
RTP translation after disrupting the
[SPEAKER_00]: double loop two and double loop three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we studied on the characters
required for the read-through translation
[SPEAKER_00]: required for the double loop one in
read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we focused on the plasticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we changed the double loop size by one
input card or two input cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the read-through translation can be
detected by a weapon block, indicating the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of the double loop doesn't matter for
the read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we naturally started the position
and the sequence between the stop coding
[SPEAKER_00]: and the read-through translation on
enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we related the sequence of the
nucleotide between the stop coding and the
[SPEAKER_00]: translation on enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generating 500 nucleotides decreased
RTD muting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put from the RTP translation can be
detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with one way we replaced the
nucleotide between these two regions with
[SPEAKER_00]: the foreign HATAC sequence.
Also, the RTP can be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicating the position and the sequence
between these two regions is not so
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly required for the read-through
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have told you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formal work found that the state-reached
element and the translation on enhancer is
[SPEAKER_00]: very important for related virus
read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there is a very similar
secondary structure between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: related virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: To check whether the state-reached region
of our read-through virus also required
[SPEAKER_00]: for read-through translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see whether or not there is a
communication between the state-reached
[SPEAKER_00]: element and the translation on enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether this interaction is virus
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a sterile chimeric mutant was
constructed as shown in the finger,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the wild-type of the read-through
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could detect the RTP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we deleted the state-reached
element of the read-through virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: no RTP could be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we replaced the read-through virus
state-reached region with the related CYD
[SPEAKER_00]: way, state-reached element, there is also
no RTP can be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when we replace the read-through
virus translational enhancer with the
[SPEAKER_00]: related CYD way translational enhancer,
no RTP can be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we replace both
state-reached region and the translational
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer with the CYD way related
sequence, we can find RTP can be
[SPEAKER_00]: translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicating that communication between
translational enhancer with the
[SPEAKER_00]: state-reached domain is virus specific and
indispensable for RTP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say, next we asked what the effect of
RTP mutants on infection of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lethal virus titer was measured in
satamically infected leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can find all the mutants can get
satamic infection as early as three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, with the RTP translation,
all the virus titer increased by time.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, without RTP expression,
the virus titer decreased from three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, the direct RTP mutant,
you can see the titer is always decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: to a very low level.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we found there are titer switch
using the W1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The titer of virus switch to increase in
six or seven weeks to inoculation with
[SPEAKER_00]: this W1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see what happened on this mutant,
whether or not these sequence are still
[SPEAKER_00]: kept integrated as constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RTPCR was carried out to check the
sequence integrated on this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, we detect the mutant sequence
from three weeks to inoculation leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: from three weeks to inoculation leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that all the mutants still
can be integrated as constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the Y5 secondary structure of the
translational enhancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see all the mutants secondary
structure of the W1 was still being
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we detect the sequence from
eight weeks to inoculation infected plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found they all have additional
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that a complementary mutation
that would restore a studio's W1 structure
[SPEAKER_00]: was found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the W1 structure is a little
different with the Y5, as shown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: figure, but they restore W1 structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see whether this sequence is
working, you restore the residual
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made this mutation into the before
virus infection clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you change it into benzimianalib,
and then detect the RTP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that all the mutants can restart
RTP translation, indicating that the W1
[SPEAKER_00]: structure is very important for residual
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the structure is in a very strong
selective pressure to maintain the RTP
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the conclusion of part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A translational enhancer located 640
nucleotides downstream of the CP cell
[SPEAKER_00]: coding is required for residual
translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: W1 of the translational enhancer is
required for efficient RTP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a productivity to a structure
communication between the translational
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancer and the state in which element is
required and virus specific, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: length and makeup of the sequence between
them is not important for residual
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a strong selection for mutation
that restore a W1 structure that allow RTP
[SPEAKER_00]: translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we found that the RTP can be
recovered translating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might have very important infection
in the virus survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the part two, I will introduce our
study on the residual protein infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found there is an interaction
between the before virus and P with that
[SPEAKER_00]: residual protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, a model was used to explain
the RTP and P interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the flume-limited virus,
after they get inoculation into the flume
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues by a bit or some other infection,
they have to overcome two barriers to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they can establish the successful
infection with the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, they have to get the application
in the inoculation field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, they have to move out from the
replication site, both in the cell-to-cell
[SPEAKER_00]: level and also they have to move in a
long-distance level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to move to the flume and get
symptomatic infection and then excise from
[SPEAKER_00]: the flume and start new infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see whether the RTP domain has any
effect on before virus replication,
[SPEAKER_00]: a serious RTD domain was constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these mutants, the RTD protein was
seriously impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: As shown in the finger, we found that the
RTD domain had no effect on virus
[SPEAKER_00]: replication, both in three days
post-inoculation and five days
post-inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This result excludes the possibility that
the RTD domain has the effect on virus
[SPEAKER_00]: replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I showed you before, we can detect the
symptomatic infection of the virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: the RTD mutant, as early as 3 weeks,
indicating that absence of RTP doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent symptomatic movement of the virus
through flume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next we want to ask whether RTP has the
effect on the cell-to-cell movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: this virus So tissue prints were performed
to detect the cell-to-cell movement in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flume tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, with the RTD mutant, with the RTD
expression, we can see a lot of infection
[SPEAKER_00]: foresight in the flume tissue,
both in the, this is the stern,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the cross-section of the lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see a lot of infection foresight.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, without RTP expression,
the virus is present, but the infection
[SPEAKER_00]: foresight is very limited, indicating that
the RTP protein has some role in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell-to-cell movement of the lymphovirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RTD protein is the mutant protein
of this virus, and our homework found that
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of infection foresight are also
decreased in tissue infected with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lymphovirus mutant that doesn't translate
MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The similar phenotype between the RTP
mutant and the MP mutant inspires to study
[SPEAKER_00]: whether there is a functional interaction
between the RTP and the movement protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first we started the localization of
these two proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: For MP, it's the movement protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can localize to the plasma dosimeter,
and the 30S promoter, as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltrated, benzimiana lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the PD localization of MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we press the RTP and the 30S,
promoter, we found that RTP can localize
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cytoplasm and also in the
nucleolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we press RTP with the
infection or lymphovirus, the localization
[SPEAKER_00]: of the RTP changed its switch to the
plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there are some other proteins,
including from the lymphovirus,
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the localization of the RTP
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because MP has the intronic property to
localize to the plasma dosimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: so next we detect the localization of RTP
without MP translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that RTP doesn't localize to
plasma dosimeter when, in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: with MP, it's a deficient mutant,
indicating that MP protein is a protein
[SPEAKER_00]: which has the RTP protein to the plasma
dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we want to know what the mechanism
of this process, how the MP makes the RTP
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plasma dosimeter, whether there is
a direct interaction between two proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the MP tracks the RTP to the
plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also detect MP-alluin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we press MP-alluin, it can direct the
RTP to the plasma dosimeter, indicating
[SPEAKER_00]: only MP-alluin can have RTP to the plasma
dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we started the interaction
between MP and RTP to suppose whether MP
[SPEAKER_00]: drags RTP to plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the BRSD was carried out to detect the
RTP and the MP interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these two proteins can interact with
each other, we can see the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent and the confocal microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the BRSD result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We confirmed the interaction of RTP and
MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used the 34-wire CT protein as a
positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to support our idea that MP drags RTP
to the plasma dosimeter through binding,
[SPEAKER_00]: by mutagenic analysis, the region of RTP
responsible for the interaction with MP
[SPEAKER_00]: was found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there is no interaction
between these mutants with the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the positive control wire type
RTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we want to know what the
localization was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the mutation that disrupts
RTP-MP binding prevents the localization
[SPEAKER_00]: of RTP to the plasma dosimeter,
both co-infected with the lymphovirus
[SPEAKER_00]: infection or the MP-alluin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results support the idea that MP
directs the RTP to the plasma dosimeter
[SPEAKER_00]: through binding with this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we construct these RTP mutants
into the lymphovirus infection clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: then inoculate it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that we detect the virus after
four weeks of inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that fewer infected loci observed
in tissues that technically infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: this RTP mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this phenotype is very similar with
the 001 mutant, which the RTP couldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the corresponding with the limited
infection loci, the title of the virus is
[SPEAKER_00]: also very low in the septimically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results about that RTP helps
lymphovirus cell-to-cell movement
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the binding with the movement
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is the conclusion of part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RTP domain of lymphovirus has no
effect on virus replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTP is not required for long-distance
movement, but it facilitates septimically
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTP interacts directly with MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binding to MP redirects the RTP to the
plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: RTP appears to infection to move before
virus becomes lone companion cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still unknown whether the cell-to-cell
movement requires structure RTP or soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: RTP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the whole summary of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the lymphovirus gets inoculated into
the plant's cell, firstly, they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: translate the replication associated
protein and make the lymphovirus get
[SPEAKER_00]: replication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they will incur some protein,
such as CP and MP.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the RTP, for the RIPP translation,
there is a translational enhancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream, or the stop coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can form a double structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through communication with the
septimally rich domain, inhibit the
[SPEAKER_00]: release factor coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the translation will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The restored protein will get translated.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this protein gets translated,
it will be recognized by the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and, as the help of the movement
protein, to reach the plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how the virus moves to the neighbor
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know whether MP moves to
the plasma dosimeter associated with the
[SPEAKER_00]: virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there are some other possibilities
that the MP just interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soluble RTP, and they move to the
plasma dosimeter, and then modify the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plasma dosimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the virus comes to the plasma
dosimeter, this modification will
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate the virus move to the neighbor
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as we can see, the virus is very
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works in a very sophisticated
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works together both in the nucleotide
level and in the protein interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here is the acknowledgement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank all the members from Stude's Green

Thank you.
