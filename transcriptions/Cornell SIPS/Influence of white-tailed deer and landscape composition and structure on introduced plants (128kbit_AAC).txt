[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Tony.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good to be back at Cornell and
back in my home department or section now,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and crop sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks, everyone, for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, like Tony said, I'm sharing
results from my dissertation, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: completed last summer, looking at invasive
plants and white-tailed deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, I just want to thank my
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Mortensen, Erica Smithwick were my
co-advisors at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a lot of help with this project,
from lots of field assistants to several
[SPEAKER_00]: contributors of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of scientists in the region shared
their large plant community data sets with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really grateful for those
contributions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for, oh, this might be advancing
automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for the other support I received
at Penn State, both funding and otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So invasive plants are associated with a
lot of changes, both at the ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: level and within the plant community,
such as altered plant, animal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodiversity is often associated with
plant invasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ecosystem processes can also be
influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologizing for this advancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just switch this presenter view,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's go back here for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although all of these changes are
occurring alongside plant invasions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't necessarily know that plants are
the drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question is whether other
processes, such as changing disturbance
[SPEAKER_00]: regimes or altered community assembly
factors, such as landscape configuration
[SPEAKER_00]: and deer browsing, might actually be the
ultimate drivers causing ecosystem changes
[SPEAKER_00]: often associated with invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer are quite abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, at Valley Forge,
the current deer density is 84 deer per
[SPEAKER_00]: square kilometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is several orders of magnitude
higher than pre-European settlement deer
[SPEAKER_00]: densities, which were often less than 10
deer per square kilometer, often around
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in nearby areas in Ithaca,
actually, there are about 100 deer per
[SPEAKER_00]: square mile in certain places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer populations, as many of you know,
are quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can have big effects on plants,
especially in forest understories where
[SPEAKER_00]: deer take shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in this Ohio forest a very
strong browse line as a result of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: deer pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can reduce the number of shrubs
and herbs in forest understories,
[SPEAKER_00]: causing impacts on other animals that rely
on those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this can create a window of
opportunity for invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, there are a lot of examples of
plant invasions in forest understories,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as this Japanese barberry in
Connecticut, garlic mustard, which many of
[SPEAKER_00]: you are probably familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are yearly pulls of garlic mustard
in the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Japanese stiltgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in southeastern New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this grass, and the others,
are potentially facilitated by selective
[SPEAKER_00]: deer browsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are there so many deer across the
landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to show this, I just want to give you
an idea of how the landscape has changed
[SPEAKER_00]: since pre-European settlement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, there's a lot of agricultural
cover, whereas there used to be large
[SPEAKER_00]: contiguous tracks of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the yellow here, you see
agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red and the pink indicate developed
land cover, whereas the blue and the green
[SPEAKER_00]: are much less apparent in this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet that used to be the prevailing land
cover across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer are responding to this change in
landscape configuration because the
[SPEAKER_00]: foraging quality is much better along
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in forest edges and in open habitats,
including crop fields, deer can be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in both soy and in corn even,
and especially in cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer can cause quite an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, invasive plants are also
responding to changes in landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially over the last century,
both deer and invasive plants have
[SPEAKER_00]: basically gotten a huge advantage by the
effects that humans have had on changing
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape composition and configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broadly, my research falls into the
overarching field in ecology of community
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm showing here is the three
major selection factors that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: determining the local plant community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These must disperse and move to a certain
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they must tolerate the
environment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must have a physiological
tolerance for that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within the ecological species
pool, these species compete and also must
[SPEAKER_00]: cope with natural enemies, such as deer in
the case of plant communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only then will the local plant
community be realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm focusing my research in this area
where I'm looking at the effect of deer on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spatially, deer are responding to the
landscape by choosing which landscapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: communities offer the best foraging
opportunities and also weighing those
[SPEAKER_00]: against other requirements they have for
finding mates and shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research today I'll be sharing
occurred at three different foci.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part of my work is at the
plant community scale and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: community level, where I looked at
unfenced and fenced plots from across the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be showing you those results
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I zoomed in to look at whether deer
preferences are helping to explain plant
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance patterns that are occurring in
plant communities across the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, I stepped back to
consider the context of landscape and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of deer on introduced plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, across the region, what are the
effects of deer on introduced and native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at the community level?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I want to show you an example of
a fenced and unfenced plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fenced plot on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a very clear dividing
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this slide better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say this deer has been
superimposed just for illustrative
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the plot on the left, you notice a
lot of Japanese dill grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant has grown almost all the
way up to the fence edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it almost completely stops in
this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hardly any Japanese dill grass
occurring inside the fence where deer have
[SPEAKER_00]: been excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really striking difference in
the plant community composition and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that deer browsing,
their selective browsing, might have
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitated the invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how might deer facilitate plant
invasion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're very selective browsers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They browse only species they find
palatable and avoid other species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which then gain a competitive advantage in
the plant community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effects of deer include changing
competitive hierarchies in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can have the result of limiting
forest understory diversity and creating
[SPEAKER_00]: windows of opportunity for exotic plants
to invade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there are ecosystem processes that
are influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the decreasing stability in some of
those processes can, again, invite plant
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some studies have already looked at the
effects of deer on invasive plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that in many cases deer increase
plant invasion, such as by increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover of garlic mustard and Japanese dill
grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at other sites, there have been
no effects or conflicting effects within
[SPEAKER_00]: studies, such as at one site, multiflora
rose was increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at another site, which happened to be
older, it was not the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the really interesting study is that in
some cases, in this particular case,
[SPEAKER_00]: deer decreased oriental bittersweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oriental bittersweet is another invasive
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appeared that deer presence
actually decreased the abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my work aims to bring clarity to some
of these equivocal results in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature and also to more broadly
understand the role of deer in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion across the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these studies only used one or two
sites, my intention was to use sites from
[SPEAKER_00]: across the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a map of those 24 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I collected data at these two sites in
northwestern Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, like I said, most of the data
sets were contributed by other scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this first part of my work,
I hypothesized that deer would alter plant
[SPEAKER_00]: community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, they would facilitate
plant invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of introduced plants and reduce the
abundance of native plants, diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance of native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data comprised 229 paired plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a total of 458 plots across the
24 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although the experiments varied quite
widely in the purposes for the experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place, and the duration,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the sites had in common that they
had fenced and unfenced plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure what's going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the commonality was they all had fenced
and unfenced plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all measured woody and herbaceous
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the data sources varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The duration of the experiments varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm controlling for that as you'll see
with a random effect approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using data from lots of different
sources can be very unwieldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a really big challenge,
particularly in that different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance metrics were used across the 24
data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 14 sites, stem density was used to
estimate plant abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in many other sites, cover was
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cover classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or cover classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of all of the... Let
me mute this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have some background noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the cover classes used across
the data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, they really varied
from experiment to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to combine all of the abundance
metrics into... Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it might be a Mac issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather windows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I'm moving on to the data
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at plant community composition,
I used an indicator species analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this determines the species that are
associated with certain treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my case, I'm looking at the species
that are associated with the deer
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, plus deer in the control plots,
and without deer in the fenced plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to look at species and community
levels, I used mixed model analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: variance and looked at both plant species
and community levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though today, I'll only have time to talk
about that plant community level in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just briefly, I used fixed effects as
deer, but the random effects were plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: pair, and site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm controlling for the within site
variability as well as between site
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the between site variability,
I think, is where a lot of the noise might
[SPEAKER_00]: come in if I wasn't controlling for those
as random effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, in summary, about 700 plant taxa
were recorded across the 24 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: 383 of those were native and 111 were
introduced plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big gap there, you'll
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the species, unfortunately,
over 200 could not be identified down to
[SPEAKER_00]: species level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit unfortunate,
but I think that tells us, to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: degree, where the state of our taxonomy
expertise lies in going out and collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that across occurred,
but I'm focusing on the species that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could identify to the level of either
being introduced or native.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 18 species were present in plots
where deer occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two additional species were occurring
where deer were excluded on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that there were about three
introduced plants, whether deer were
[SPEAKER_00]: present or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, a lot of taxa were only
occurring where deer were present or
[SPEAKER_00]: absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 14% of the 700 taxa occurred only where
deer were present, not occurring where
[SPEAKER_00]: deer were excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then similarly, 18% of the species
occurred only where deer were absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm beginning to show you the
differences between deer and no deer
[SPEAKER_00]: plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can already see that deer have a
very big impact on plant community
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, here I'm showing you the
indicator species analysis results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm beginning with the six species
that are the six introduced species that
[SPEAKER_00]: are indicators of deer presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that three of these six
are considered highly invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also occurring across a lot of
the 229 deer plots and across a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the most widely
spread invasive plants in the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in forest understories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were several native species
associated with deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the species that you're more
likely to see across the landscape and are
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely to persist despite high deer
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in contrast, they're occurring across
many fewer of the plots and sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not as widely distributed
across the region as are the invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the more frequent
species, oxalis, clearweed, coral berry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and stinging nettle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these species are ones that I might
consider planting because they're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably going to persist in the
face of deer better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as where deer were excluded,
there were five introduced plants strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with that treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, three of them, happen to be
three, are considered highly invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are Japanese honeysuckle,
bush honeysuckle, and multiflora rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a picture of a bird on a fence
here because the birds might be
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to the presence of these
fleshy, fruited species inside fenced
[SPEAKER_00]: plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Birds might preferentially land on the
fence because it's a perch point in itself
[SPEAKER_00]: or within the plants that are growing
inside the fence, which the vegetation is
[SPEAKER_00]: much more dense inside the plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are more perch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be one explanation why there
are fleshy, fruited invasives occurring in
[SPEAKER_00]: forest understory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly forest understory plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, I had shown six invasive plants
that were associated, or three invasive
[SPEAKER_00]: plants associated with no deer plots,
three associated with the absence of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are 27 native plants associated
with the absence of deer, suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: the natives are more susceptible to deer
browse than the exotic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are some of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent native species associated with
the absence of deer, white ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: spicebush, black cherry, and even poison
ivy, suggesting that deer might find these
[SPEAKER_00]: species particularly palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the case of spicebush, maybe birds
are, again, helping to disperse these
[SPEAKER_00]: species to where deer have been excluded
because of additional perch points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, we're seeing more native
species with big differences in introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The native plants appear to be more
impacted by deer than the introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the community level, I'm seeing similar
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The introduced species richness did not
change, whether deer were present or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And absolute introduced plant abundance
was also unaffected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this corresponds to what I was seeing
in the indicator species analysis results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approximately the same number of
introduced plants are associated with each
[SPEAKER_00]: of those treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there happened to be three in each of
invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, deer had a big negative impact on
native plant abundance and plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer decreased native plant abundance
in all three of the abundance metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is reflecting what I was
showing in the indicator species analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total plant species richness and abundance
also declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly that was due to the native
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a difference here in how deer
are impacting exotic plants and native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it translates to a proportional
increase in the invadedness of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proportion of introduced plant
cover and midpoint is higher where deer
[SPEAKER_00]: are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though deer didn't influence the
absolute abundance of exotic introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they're increasing the relative
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're increasing the degree of plant
invasion, or in other words, the
[SPEAKER_00]: invadedness of plant communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't the same for plant stem
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one explanation for this is that deer
might increase the foliage on a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not necessarily kill the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stem might persist, even though the
overall cover of that individual stem is
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bigger deer effect on cover
than on stem density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be one way to interpret this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So revisiting the hypotheses that I first
laid out for this particular part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: research, I did find that deer alter plant
community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple caveats in this second
hypothesis, deer facilitated the invasion
[SPEAKER_00]: of some species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the community level, they increased
the relative abundance of invasive plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: not absolute abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, there were definitely
reductions in native plant diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance in the face of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my next question is whether deer
preferences can help explain some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns that I observed across the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the second part of my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to show this briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go through it all, but please ask
me questions about this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: project, because this was a really
interesting and fun experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I set up deer preference trials at the
deer pens at Penn State, where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: captive deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used 15 different plant species
offered to the deer in a cafeteria style,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple choice preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reference trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used introduced species and native
species, some that were expected to be
[SPEAKER_00]: palatable, others that were expected to be
unpalatable from both groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you an example of the
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if this video will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't always feed at the same time,
but there were always two deer in the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were too scared to be in a pen alone,
as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't have regular feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them eating blackberry here
and honeysuckle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeysuckle turned out to be one of their
favorites, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing you the results here based
on the electivity index, which takes into
[SPEAKER_00]: account the total amount of biomass
offered within each trial and the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of biomass offered for each individual
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes into account how much was
eaten of each species relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a positive value indicates that the
deer preferred that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero indicates random feeding or feeding
in proportion to that amount offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And zero indicates the plant was avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm just showing the overall
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the invasive
introduced species on average tended to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more avoided than the native species,
which, especially in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: were more often selected than the invasive
introduced species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was an interaction at the level
of season and species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing here the same results,
but with species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the 15 species that I included
in the trial on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within each group, invasive and
native, I saw quite a range of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: palatabilities and deer preferences for
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've arranged them here according to
deer preference within each group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could talk a lot about deer preferences
and the particular plant traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm just going to focus on the most
preferred and the most avoided species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bush honeysuckle, European privet,
and oriental bittersweet were the most
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you'll notice these all have
fleshy fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the native species, red maple was a
little bit of a surprise to find that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the most palatable of the natives.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the literature, there have been
suggestions that it's not that palatable
[SPEAKER_00]: of a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is all relative to just
these species that I included in the
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deer were not starved,
just so you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had plenty of hay and regular food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these were all somewhat of treats
given.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were given an opportunity to have
some real plant material, not just hay and
[SPEAKER_00]: pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of the species that were avoided,
Japanese stiltgrass, garlic mustard,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Japanese barberry were highly avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed that based on some
additional data we collected of the
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior, deer feeding behavior,
the deer quickly learned that these
[SPEAKER_00]: species were ones to be avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might explain why across the
region, we're seeing that these species
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in the face of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unpalatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're avoided relative to other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gain a competitive advantage in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the native species, hay scented
fern was the least palatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is interesting, because it's a
species that has been noted as a native
[SPEAKER_00]: invader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the 24 deer research
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Northwestern Pennsylvania,
where you can see the fenced plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to outline that on the left,
where there are a lot more plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: shrubs, and yet where deer are occurring,
there's a lot of hay scented fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no introduced plants at this
site, but there is a lot of hay scented
[SPEAKER_00]: fern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one point we might take from
this is that deer can cause an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant species, whether it's native or
introduced, if that plant is unpalatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the unpalatability seems to be more
important than whether the plant was
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer are making choices at the species
level, not at the level of introduced or
[SPEAKER_00]: native.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to sum up this deer preference
section, yes, deer feeding preferences can
[SPEAKER_00]: help us understand what's going on in the
plant communities across the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as plants that increase or decrease
in the face of deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deer preferences vary at the species
level, not at the native introduced level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the process of plant invasion can
really be informed by understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes going on at this very small
patch level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this last part of my research,
I just wanted to share a little bit of my
[SPEAKER_00]: findings based on interactions that are
occurring between deer and landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: configuration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deer aren't interacting with plant
communities in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other factors going on
surrounding these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the importance of deer,
given the context of landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stepping back here, looking at the
landscape scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do I mean by fragmentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, it can imply a loss of
habitat, changing landscape composition,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as forests being replaced by ag or
developed land cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, fragmentation implies broken
apart landscape patches, such as a
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease in patch connectivity and
increasing edge habitat, which I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that facilitates both deer
and invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So briefly, these are the metrics that I
used to describe landscape fragmentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: both landscape structure and landscape
composition metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should move on and not talk too
much about this right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, deer and invasive plants are
responding to landscape fragmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems that because deer were shown
to have impacts on plant communities
[SPEAKER_00]: across the region, that this is something
we should really consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on surrounding the sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hypothesized here that both landscape
attributes and deer would jointly
[SPEAKER_00]: influence plant invasion and high deer
density, not just deer presence or
[SPEAKER_00]: absence, which I only focused on in the
first part of my research, will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: plant invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used the same data from the 24 deer
research sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each site had an independent estimate of
the number of deer per square kilometer at
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used those data, as well as national
land cover data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used many landscapes to describe
the surrounding fragmentation at each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, this is the Ithaca land
cover tile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the airport, the mall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a deer exclosure site located
right here within this landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pink and the red are developed cover,
as you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell is down here near the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yellow and brown represent the
agricultural land cover, while green
[SPEAKER_00]: represents forested cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the whole range of landscapes
surrounding the 24 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see they range broadly in the
amount of forested cover, agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: cover, and developed cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are much closer to centers of
high human population density,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some are very isolated from the
influence of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these sites had no introduced
plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others had many introduced plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used several different approaches to
analyze this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to focus on some results
from the mixed models and regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll give you a summary of the overall
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ordination visualizations helped me see
that there are multiple invasive plants
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring at a lot of these sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sites have, or the plots are much
more similar in community composition to
[SPEAKER_00]: others within that site than across sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of the sites are very different in
plant community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as what I found from random forest
results, this is a regression tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analysis-based approach to look at the
relative importance of different
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that landscape fragmentation
metrics and native species richness were
[SPEAKER_00]: more strongly associated with plant
invasion metrics than was deer presence
[SPEAKER_00]: absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells you something right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the landscape level, perhaps the effect
of deer isn't as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And exotic species richness,
interestingly, was explained largely by
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape factors, but also by native
species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this model, I had a very high R
squared value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leads me to think that these three
factors are quite important in
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the number of species,
the number of exotic species at a site.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the mixed model analysis,
there were interactions among deer
[SPEAKER_00]: presence absence, the fragmentation
metrics, and native species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you one example of
that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, as agricultural land cover
increases, the invasion, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the percent of introduced stems,
or the proportion of the stems that are
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced, increase with agricultural
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, there's a positive
relationship here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within each of the sites, the effect
of deer plays an important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: This interaction was significant between
deer and agricultural cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the sites where ag cover is minimal,
mostly forested sites, we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of introduced stems,
the percentage of introduced stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: is higher than where agricultural land
cover is much greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the white symbols are higher than
the gray symbols, where ag cover is low,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the opposite, where ag cover is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what might be causing this
relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: One explanation is that the invaders,
the invasive species, vary across this
[SPEAKER_00]: gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, at these sites where deer were
present, Japanese stiltgrass and garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard were the invaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the higher agricultural land
cover landscapes, these species,
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose,
are more abundant, where deer have been
[SPEAKER_00]: excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think this might be a result
of bird dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: These species are more common along edges
and in open habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not surprising that the propagule
pressure of these species would be higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in a landscape covered more by
agricultural and open land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to look at not just deer presence
absence, but also to make use of the deer
[SPEAKER_00]: density data that was available,
I found that as deer density increased,
[SPEAKER_00]: so did the cover of introduced plants and
the percent of introduced species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wasn't found for all of the
metrics that I used to look at plant
[SPEAKER_00]: invasion, but it was a significant
relationship here, suggesting that deer
[SPEAKER_00]: density does make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, in revisiting the hypotheses,
landscape attributes and deer presence
[SPEAKER_00]: were both important in considering
landscape configuration and deer
[SPEAKER_00]: preference and deer presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can more fully understand what's going
on with plant invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a couple final points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surrounding landscape composition can
help explain why some sites are invaded
[SPEAKER_00]: and others are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a much better understanding of
plant invasion by considering the factors
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the landscape scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, deer increase the
abundance of several invasive plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but reduce others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer are indirectly facilitating plant
invasion because of the major decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: they have in native plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deer preferences are helping to
explain those patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the landscape scale,
both deer abundance and exotic plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant invasion are linked to the
overarching structure and composition of
[SPEAKER_00]: the surrounding landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And invaders differ according to both the
landscape and according to deer
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think considering both of these is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understanding the plant invasion process
is strengthened when we examine it in
[SPEAKER_00]: light of co-occurring multi-scalar
ecological patterns and processes such as
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape fragmentation and increasing
deer populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps forest fragmentation and deer
browsing are the ultimate drivers of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ecosystem changes that we see in
association with plant invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, I think, important to think
a little bit broadly about whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really the plants that are driving these
changes or are they just passengers kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of along for the ride as a result of other
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, managing invasive plants might
be ineffective unless we're also managing
[SPEAKER_00]: for changes in landscape structure and
composition and the increasing deer
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one way to ask a final question
is what's more desirable, having very
[SPEAKER_00]: little growing where there's very clear
browse lines and forest understories or
[SPEAKER_00]: having introduced plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course this is kind of an
exaggerated either or, but I think because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a window of opportunity in a lot
of forest understories because of the high
[SPEAKER_00]: deer pressure, the result is having
invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe invasive plants are offering
some services that we've overlooked and
[SPEAKER_00]: Antonia and I have talked about how that
might be an interesting path to go down
[SPEAKER_00]: from here on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I hope there are minutes for
questions, but it doesn't look like there
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has anything they'd like to ask
me now or later, I'd be happy to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've thought about that a lot over
the past few years and one explanation is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're typically higher light
environment species and whereas I studied
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of, I studied the plant communities
and forest understories for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be a difference there between
high light and low light environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in high light environments those
species tend to grow really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might just be able to outgrow any
of the deer browsing that occurs in those
[SPEAKER_00]: open habitats because I have noticed in
walking through fields even that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: deer browse occurring on those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it's just not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deer don't want to eat 100% of their
diet of one shrubby invasive plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only eat so much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the high deer pressure is a really
big concern in reducing the native species
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'd prefer to regenerate the
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it looks like there are a couple
exotic trees that might or invasive trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be taking the place of our
native trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's my research really
just supports the fact that tree
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration is a big concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Native trees just are at a disadvantage
given the really high deer densities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of a related question about
the regeneration of, I'm wondering in your
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis, some of these trees are too big
for the deer to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever's controlling their cover is
not deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering in your analysis,
are you focusing just on the understory
[SPEAKER_01]: species that the deer could actually
browse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just focusing on what's going on in
the understory, although some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: species were black cherry, maple,
and oak in the understory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those species were much more common
where deer were excluded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of related to that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, I don't know if you
explicitly looked at the high light
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, but it seems like the
haystack and fern is coming in with light
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching the fourth floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you looked at that sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't specifically look at light
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the comments I was making
earlier, anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that high light could increase
certain invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these unpalatable species
that are more common, such as the Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: stiltgrass and garlic mustard,
are tolerant of low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they must have those
anti-herbivore characteristics in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: persist even in the face of deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, one last question, Janice?
[SPEAKER_00]: On your first point, there have been some
studies showing that deer are dispersing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these invasive plants, including
Japanese stiltgrass, which was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely the fleshy fruited species,
they're dispersing those into the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: across the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as which species to plant,
I mean, definitely put up a front.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fence around anything you find
really prized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we've resorted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, a quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does your work compare to what's
happened out in the West?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's obviously different invasive plant
species there, and deer have an impact
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you compared this ecosystem with
other ecosystems?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's happening elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looking at the literature,
it seems like my research is in support of
[SPEAKER_00]: or congruent with a lot of the other
findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deer generally reduce the palatable
species, increase unpalatable species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the unpalatable species is exotic,
it definitely garners more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what my research suggests,
and especially with the haste-ended fern,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's other literature, too,
to back up the haste-ended fern,
[SPEAKER_00]: native invader kind of point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, overall, I think they're pretty
similar in findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One difference might be if not just
abundant herbivores are considered,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just herbivores in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And herbivores in general actually have
somewhat different patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with deer, in our case, they're very,
very abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit of a different
scenario when you consider a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: abundant native species, such as deer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can talk more about that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
