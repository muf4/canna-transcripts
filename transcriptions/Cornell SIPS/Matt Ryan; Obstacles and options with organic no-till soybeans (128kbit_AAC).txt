[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I think it's a little after 11,
so we are going to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the organic no-till session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everyone's having a good time
and enjoying what you've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to be talking about
organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you about my
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have some farmers who
have been practicing organic no-till for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to start off, how many people have
worked with organic no-till before?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so maybe half of you or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a different type of cropping
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start off talking about some
of the benefits here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to talk to you about my
understanding of the system at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some challenges over the past
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a great potential with
organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a little bit of additional
management and a little forethought with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the benefits, as you can
imagine, having residue like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we were talking about with the soil
health session, that could be really
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly to protect against soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past year, we've seen quite a bit
of increase in the extreme rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five inches of rain within an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A farmer just down the road experienced
that a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of soil erosion there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this mulch there can certainly
help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can improve soil health, improve water
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another big thing here is reducing
labor and fuel requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, I've always kind of
assumed that there are these soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured we can measure this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's this assumption that they will
be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was more focused on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking that organic farmers,
they do a lot of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can get away from that
cultivation, that interval cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would typically do in soybean
and rely on mulch, then that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: really beneficial for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a photograph from down at Penn
State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're happy to have Bill Kern and Mary
Barbacek in the room who have worked in
[SPEAKER_00]: this system down at Penn State with
organic rotational no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to just
recognize what we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typical organic management starts with
some moldboard plowing most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some blind cultivation, either tine
weeding or rotary hoeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then multiple passes with interval
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do with this
organic no-till system is to reduce this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically eliminate this and substitute it
with this system where we're rolling down
[SPEAKER_00]: this cover crop and then no-till planting
crops like corn and soybean behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell you right now that most of
the presentation will focus on soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic no-till soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done some work in organic no-till
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not been successful, as successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've experienced quite a bit of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly in New York, it's even more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where we do see consistent success,
is with organic no-till soybean into
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled cereal rye or rolled triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some numbers from a modeling
exercise that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at a corn-soybean-wheat rotation
and comparing traditional tilled organic
[SPEAKER_00]: to this organic no-till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this comparison, both the corn and
the soybean were no-till planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the assumption that we were
making in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to this with the traditional
tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we compare to traditional
tillage-based management, we see 27%
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in diesel fuel, 31% reduction in
labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some other environmental benefits
in terms of reduced energy use and reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be providing a broad
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important to think
about your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consider your cover crop to be a
critical part of the system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike other cropping systems where your
main focus is your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're lucky and you have some
time, then you put in your cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: after your cash crop is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to be treating your cover
crop like a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is seeding early in the
fall, using good seed, seeding at a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: rate than what you might normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are some photographs from
Kloss Martin's farm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when Jeff Liebert, a graduate
student in my lab, was doing some on-farm
[SPEAKER_00]: research with Kloss looking at barley and
triticale and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is Kloss's tractor here with a
front-mounted roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the different cover crops
here that were rolled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen both down in
Pennsylvania and up here is that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the timing right, if you are
not managing at the correct time,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's potential for reseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be a problem in some
situations, maybe not so much of a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, this is down at Rock Springs
in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was cereal rye that was rolled too
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically what we say is when
you're rolling it down, you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you can consistently kill
it with a roller crimper, this cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people that are allergic to
cereal rye, that can be really dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: and quite problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you want your tractor
covered in pollen if you're doing it at
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is rye that was rolled too
early, bounced back, and that rye is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to seed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rye over here, this was rolled a
little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the effect of termination
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claire Keen, who was a graduate student
with Bill Kern down at Penn State,
[SPEAKER_00]: she just published a paper looking at the
effect of this bounce back and this
[SPEAKER_00]: incomplete kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can happen is if this goes to
seed now, you can imagine that there would
[SPEAKER_00]: be volunteer crops in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are following this rotation,
following soybean with wheat, having that
[SPEAKER_00]: rye contaminate your wheat can be a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're planting triticale
after this and you're harvesting it for
[SPEAKER_00]: forage, it may not be such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really your crop rotation kind of
dictates how important the timing of that
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this system, it requires a
different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really want to emphasize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greater attention to detail here,
advanced planning, and adaptive
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by advanced planning,
when you're thinking about doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: organic no-till soybean system,
you really got to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be thinking about when you're
going to plant your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically you need to be ordering
seed in July, the year before you are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be planting your soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your rye growing or your triticale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then adaptive management.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I think we need to pay
more attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really requires everything to line up
in this system for it to work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally convinced it can work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get high yields in this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes everything to line up
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if things don't line up, so say you're
prevented from planting your cereal rye
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't get it in until late,
or if there's a problem, heavy rainfall,
[SPEAKER_00]: or bad seed, and you don't have a good
stand, you need to change your plans and
[SPEAKER_00]: not proceed with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to know what these thresholds
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So know when to do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know when to plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this system, it takes different
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using no-till planters that are
heavy, that have a coulter up front to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: through that residue and then get good
seed to soil contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then unlike traditional tillage-based
management, there are some different pests
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennial weeds can be worse in this
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early emerging weeds, such as common
ragweed, that's our number one weed
[SPEAKER_00]: problem in this rolled cereal rye no-till
soybean system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the common ragweed is a problem
because it actually emerges before the
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal rye is rolled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cereal rye is at a stage, like I said,
when it's going into anthesis and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen, where it's very easy to kill that
mechanically.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a little rye seedling or a
little ragweed seedling in that rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roller crimper will go right over top
of it and it'll go right through that
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's these early emerging weeds
that are emerging before the cereal rye is
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled down that are problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a number of different insect
pests that can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before coming to Cornell five years ago,
I was working in Pennsylvania and saw
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with armyworm and black cutworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just this past year, working with
Janet Stegney and a local farm in Groton,
[SPEAKER_00]: we saw a seed corn maggot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time that I ever saw a
seed corn maggot, but it is attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: this residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's another thing to watch out for
when you're thinking about organic
[SPEAKER_00]: rotational no-till soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to point out, we do consider this to
be a rotational system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rotational no-till because of those
perennial weeds that I was mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to try to do continuous
organic no-till, eventually you would have
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial weeds that would come in and
tank the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really think that you need some
level of tillage at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we want to minimize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that little bit of tillage,
once every three years or so, can be
[SPEAKER_00]: really beneficial for managing those
perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop selection, really important factor
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up from Pennsylvania into New York,
I talked to a number of people about
[SPEAKER_00]: organic no-till, my plans to start working
with this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would come across a lot of farmers
that said, oh yeah, you know, I went down
[SPEAKER_00]: to Rodeo before I saw their roller
crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried that up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they would tell me was that they
would roll down rye and no-till plant corn
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important to
recognize that that's a bad approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anyone that's working on
organic no-till would ever recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really because of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: With soybean, what we're trying to do,
because soybean is a legume, it can fix
[SPEAKER_00]: its own nitrogen, we really want to make
it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are benefits with the rye,
with depleting the soil nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has weed suppression benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really the goal with the
rye, to suck up all of the nitrogen that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil and make that soybean more
competitive against weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the soybean can fix its own
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that nitrogen's not there for the
weeds, it's tied up in the rye,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that gives that soybean a competitive
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have talked about trying to
maximize your rye biomass and adding
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've shied away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are thinking now that maybe some of
these thresholds that have been developed
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of how much biomass you need are
not necessarily appropriate for New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk a little bit about that
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adding nitrogen to your cover crop so
then you can go plant soybean,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me it just doesn't make a whole lot of
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can run into problems where your
cereal rye can lodge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also give those weeds more of
an advantage than they would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But soybean into rolled rye, and if you
are going to use corn, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to go into a legume cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn into rye typically fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe non-organic farmers that can put
down starter fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a lot of good planting
green farmers down in Pennsylvania that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing this, corn into rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for organic, it's just really tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we say is that even with
vetch, hairy vetch, I really like hairy
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some problems with it in terms
of it becoming a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly Claussen will say that he won't
touch the stuff because he grows a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: small grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you really want to do this
system with organic, no-till corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should really be thinking about vetch
and not rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some mixtures of hairy vetch and rye or
hairy vetch and triticale, they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial in terms of suppressing more
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really you need to watch out that you
don't have too much of that small grain in
[SPEAKER_00]: there or else you can have nitrogen
immobilization or nitrogen tie-up and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will really make your corn crop suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the other benefits with this
system as I was talking about earlier with
[SPEAKER_00]: the extreme rain events and the soil
erosion, we had a situation in 2015 and
[SPEAKER_00]: also this past year where we had a very
wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, our June was particularly wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we have four inches of rain at
our research farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had double that in June of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was really amazing was I was
working with a graduate student who was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, Jeff Liebert, who was doing a
timing study of planting and he had four
[SPEAKER_00]: different termination and planting dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to nail every single one
of those termination and planting dates
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout May and June, even with this
wet weather, because the rye in this
[SPEAKER_00]: system helped suck up that moisture and
allow us to access the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where farmers that were working in tilled
ground or did not have a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were excluded from their field.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just would bury their tractor if they
tried to go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we were able to get out there and
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some photographs comparing
tillage base management to the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the rolled rye,
bare ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This erosion, this area here, this wasn't
throughout the whole entire field,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did see patches of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly problematic, certainly don't
want to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't see any of that in the organic
no-till rolled rye system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see that same area where
there's just very poor drainage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no problems with the organic no-till
soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, really thinking about
seeing these observations, these effects
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cereal rye being beneficial to
deal with excessive rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we always assumed that there was
these benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying before, I was more
focused on the labor and the energy use
[SPEAKER_00]: and just recently started to get into
looking at the soil health aspects of this
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to quantify the effects of this
management system on soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had another graduate student,
Kira Crowley, and so she asked the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, compared to a no cover crop
control, will integrating a cereal rye
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop prior to soybean improve soil
health, weed suppression, soybean yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: and profitability?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the metrics that she was
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a research study that was
done just north of here, about a half hour
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Musgrave Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll show you some of her results.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are four different treatments
that were compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were very interested in this
roll down system, the organic no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean system here, but she wanted to
compare that to standard management.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of organic farmers, they would put
out a rye cover crop, but then plow that
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incorporate that rye cover crop
adjoining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly there are other farmers,
maybe non-organic farmers, that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: using any cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to also include a no cover
crop control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently, there's been a lot
of interest in harvesting cover crops for
[SPEAKER_00]: forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she included a rye-ledge treatment here
to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four different treatments with
the rye-ledge harvested at boot stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the four different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just take a look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which system do you think had the best
soil health here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll try to make this a little bit
more interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ideas about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Roll down system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What system do you think had the greatest
profitability?
Rye-ledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, you're following along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let me just show you the numbers
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two years that were very different
from one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, it was very wet, like I was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, it was a drought year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the average line here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the normal accumulation of
precipitation throughout the spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, 2015 being very wet, and 2016 being
very wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2016 being very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a really good comparison here,
looking at these two years to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: these different systems perform in these
contrasting environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing rye cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize for the metric units,
but I think you can just assume that this
[SPEAKER_00]: says pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar, those units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see there was a difference
in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a greater cereal rye biomass in the
spring of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really related to the seeding
date here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year, we didn't get our rye
cover crop in early, as early as we would
[SPEAKER_00]: have liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were suffering a bit with that
lower biomass in these three different
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference between these
treatments, that's all related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: different timings of the management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher biomass in the roll down system,
because we were waiting to end thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: until we would terminate that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was terminated a bit earlier,
the rye ledge, and the plow down was
[SPEAKER_00]: terminated just prior to jointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the rye biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And biomass increased with termination
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the soil respiration data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do see is it looks like there's
a trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we look at the statistics,
we see that there is a difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the roll down system and the no cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: These other treatments here were
intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this microbial respiration,
this is one of the soil health indicators
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were talking about earlier in the
soil health session.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just goes to show you that there
is some activity, some more microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity that's happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this rye, especially in the roll
down system, having that mulch there,
[SPEAKER_00]: is helping promote those and maintain
those beneficial microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorptivity, this is a metric of water
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher sorptivity, greater water
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing here is compared to
the no cover, we see greater water
[SPEAKER_00]: infiltration in the roll down system
compared to the no cover, where these
[SPEAKER_00]: other two are intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do have these extreme rain
events, we think that this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have the rolled rye system and
that have that mulch there and are
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting their soil, more water is going
to go into the soil, less of it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go off, and take your soil with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other systems, all using
mechanical cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no cover, plow down, rye ledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through, used moldboard plow
tillage, did some blind cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then interrow cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard management practices for organic
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the no till was obviously that
mulch that we were relying on for the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, you can see a lot more weed
biomass in the roll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anybody who knows anything about weed
biomass in these units and has experience
[SPEAKER_00]: on organic farms, you would know that
these levels are extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 300 or 500 kilograms per hectare of
weed biomass, that's really not a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of biomass at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were quite happy, even though this
bar is so much higher than these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still getting very good weed
suppression for an organic situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your rye ledge wouldn't be very high for a
chemical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the type of weed suppression that
you might expect in a herbicide based
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please, as we go on, feel free to ask
a question or shout out a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the treatments just prior to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did one other thing that I didn't tell
you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually interseeded some hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to explain what that green
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't weeds that's interseeded
hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to spend too much time
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's a lot of potential
with interseeding and actually using hairy
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch, particularly in this organic no
till system, to get a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the rough year here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drought year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very good production with the no cover,
with the plow down and the rye ledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just had a mess over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted them, no till planted them,
into very, very dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed sat there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get any rain afterwards for no
measurable amount of rain for a month or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those soybeans, they were stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't growing as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth rate was much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our yields were lower, as you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is interseeded hairy vetch here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also some weeds in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vetch wasn't counted in the weed
biomass slides that I was just showing
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a high clearance drill interseeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see one tomorrow if you go on the
tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: See one in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rod Porter brought one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or right, Bill Kern's talk in the
interseeding session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice a delay in maturity
[SPEAKER_00]: in the crop on
[SPEAKER_00]: the rye?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just seeing it be later?
[SPEAKER_00]: The yields end up being OK, but it's like
two to three years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our soybeans are reaching yellow leaf drop
about a week or two earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than in the no till system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not quite sure what's going on
there, but that is pretty consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we try to avoid
with having that mulch cover up all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let me just show you the yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have this reference line of 45
bushels per acre here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soybean yields, I'd say,
for us, under organic conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were happy with this in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, we were really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's just because those
soybeans had such a rough start in that
[SPEAKER_00]: dry conditions, in that dry soil and rye
that was there, that they were stunted and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just never caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this is really important to
recognize here that there are challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before 2016, I was going around talking
about organic no till soybean as a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution to climate change, all of the
problems associated with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, OK, well, in the Northeast,
our problems are too much water in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and not enough water mid-season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under the roll-down system,
that's where it really shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have too much water in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rye sucks up that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then having that mulch there in
mid-summer, that's where it really
[SPEAKER_00]: conserves that soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this year really caught me by
surprise with these drought conditions in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, no water in 2016 in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people talk about the dangers of cover
crops in the West under dry, rain-fed
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never really thought that we'd
experience that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was certainly a problem and
something to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summary of our results from CARE's
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So profitability, as you expected,
was greatest in the rye-ledge treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can make use of that rye-ledge
and then get a soybean crop in afterwards,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were trends in soil health and some
of those other indicators that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at where it might be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might just need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at that to see if there are
actually differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: More weeds in the roll-down system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowest cost in the no cover, but lowest
labor in the roll-down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking about the messages that
I want to convey to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about these indicators and
thresholds that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important,
like I was saying, to know when to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: the plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're a Kenny Rogers fan and you
know that song The Gambler, you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: to fold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when to hold them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need to know when to fold
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say this will prevent a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people come to sessions like this
and hear about organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go out and they try to do it on
all their land or in areas where maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they shouldn't try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're suggesting is that
people really avoid weedy fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to put this in a field that
you've consistently had problems with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly want to avoid fields that
have a lot of perennial weeds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking with a farmer a little
further west of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took CRP land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if Tom is in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he took CRP land, planted rye,
and then did a no-till soybean into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was some of his first experience with
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had a lot of perennial weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine coming out of CRP
land, the Conservation Reserve Program,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you just have a buildup of perennial
propagules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, he was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's getting a good crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got a nice price for his beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could have been a lot better if you
would have went into a field or tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with those weeds beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you realize, for one reason or
another, that your cover crop is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to cut it because it's too
sparse or too thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see in this cover crop,
these are weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's black medic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not clover there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're in a situation like this,
I think it's just really good to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: and to change plans, adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have had the best intentions to
doing some organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, you should really be
thinking about either harvesting the rye
[SPEAKER_00]: or planting it down or doing something
different, mowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you try to roll it down and you
try to no-till plant soybean into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have weed problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thinking about this year and
these messages that I want to get across,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in a really dry situation like
we were in 2016, so no rain for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks before termination, before when you
would normally plant, and no rain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: forecast, and I say either wait for rain
or harvest for grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, when you want to no-till
plant your soybeans, it may be too late to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest that rye for rye-ledge and for
forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you might just be better
off harvesting it for grain and then going
[SPEAKER_00]: in with a different crop, sorghum,
sudan grass, or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think bags of seed or fertilizer on the
planter to get some extra weight because
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil was so dry here and to get that
that coulter into the ground and to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better seed-to-soil contact and seed
placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fitting into a crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another issue that often comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, okay, well, this sounds really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I fit this into my corn,
soybean, wheat rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in New York, it's really challenging
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been thinking, trying to put our
heads together, working with our organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and advisory board, and trying to
really think about how can you sneak in
[SPEAKER_00]: some organic no-till into your crop
rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how can you redesign your rotation so
that you can accommodate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is that you really need
to establish your cereal rye early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early September is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after corn grain, it just doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get the stand that you
need for that wheat suppression after corn
[SPEAKER_00]: grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to think about doing something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have soybean after corn if you
want to do this, and you're harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: your corn for grain and you're in the
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: What people are thinking about,
what we're looking at is some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with following organic no-till
soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going in with wheat,
that's something that some people try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's challenging even in a tilled organic
system, let alone a system where the
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity is delayed and you may be pushed
back and you're harvesting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just in general, it's challenging
around here to get your wheat in on time
[SPEAKER_00]: after soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue with that cereal rye,
that residue there, there can be a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a green bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen in some cases is if
you go in with wheat afterwards and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of rye residue, you can get
diseases like take-all that can go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: be a problem for your wheat crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rotation of corn, soybean,
wheat, really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be volunteer rye seedlings
like I was talking about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have rye in your wheat,
that can be problematic, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hoping to do something,
if you're growing for a food-grade market
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And triticale might be a better option
following soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you harvest your soybean, you have some
time to put in something, but it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: too late for wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But triticale, you can plant a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the volunteer rye seedlings in a
triticale forage crop are not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: as problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no big deal if you have some rye
volunteers in with your triticale if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're harvesting it for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a rotation that we're looking
at in the organic cropping systems
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment at the Musgrave Research Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have corn, if you will,
up here at 1 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call this a rotation clock,
but it's four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with corn over here and intercede or
not, but the next crop after that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum sedangrass, again, to give you
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Separate the corn and soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some time to plant your cereal
rye on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around here, there are markets for sorghum
sedangrass for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are getting into double
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of dairies around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a way to utilize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your cereal rye going into
soybean here, you roll it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then triticale, after triticale,
you harvest it for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you frost seed some red clover into
that, you go back to corn grain that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we're actively
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a lot of data on this yet,
but we think that this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot better than trying to cram things in
with a corn-soybean-wheat rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we're taking an extra year
growing forage crops, we think we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be better off in terms of wheat
suppression and overall profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you need to have a market for
those crops for that forage and a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around here, it seems feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much time do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to slow down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some more slides for the rest of
the time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a bit of a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Klaus Martens who's going to talk
for a bit about his experiences and his
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always come back to some of the
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking if Klaus brings up
something or if Bill brings up something
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a slide that may be helpful to
explain it, I'll just throw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Klaus, I'll turn it over to you and
we'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
