[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'll be giving a brief overview of
the work that my lab is doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable cropping systems and plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll focus in on a subset of the
work that we're doing on cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, I'm housed in plant
breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also work kind of at the
intersection of agronomy and agroecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating some management and social
science questions along with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within this kind of broad topic area,
we work on several different crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems, including forages,
cover crops, and some emerging row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on dry beans and hemp a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the major thematic areas that
we work on include the establishment phase
[SPEAKER_00]: of many of these crops, weed management,
winter hardiness, organic systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-crop systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are some of the sort of core
themes that we're thinking about in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working on these across several of the
different crops that we work on,
[SPEAKER_00]: so lots of interconnections across the
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to be able to talk
about all of these themes and crops today,
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing in more on cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we touch on a lot of the big
thematic areas within.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cover crops that we work on,
so across all of the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're thinking about early vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that establishment phase,
with cereal rye in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're focused on allelopathy as a weed
management tool across all of the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're mostly focused on winter annuals,
so fall planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we care a lot about winter
survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, we're thinking also
about breeding for tolerance to later
[SPEAKER_00]: planting dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do most of our breeding and trials
in organic systems, as cover crops are an
[SPEAKER_00]: especially important tool for organic
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also are working on a lot on
cover crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we plant a lot of our trials in
multi-species mixtures, because that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of farmers are using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the big picture of what
we're thinking about in cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I get into more of the nitty
gritty about how we operate, I just want
[SPEAKER_00]: to acknowledge the efforts of the staff
and graduate students and the many
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduates that come through our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really lucky to have a super
hardworking and adaptable and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative team that, yeah,
they've been really nimble as we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on this huge range of crops and
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the core of our cover crop breeding
work is done through the Cover Crop
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a network of collaborators
across universities, USDA ARS research
[SPEAKER_00]: stations, and USDA NRCS plant material
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The network started in 2015 and was really
motivated by a lack of breeding activities
[SPEAKER_00]: and named cultivars available for cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cover crop adoption has been
steadily increasing over recent years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that most cover crops that are planted
on the landscape are variety not stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they haven't been sort of explicitly
bred for specific breeding objectives or
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation to specific regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our premise with the network is
basically that having improved cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: will improve the performance of cover
crops and support continued increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: adoption of cover crops on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, the work started in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt Ryan in Soil and Crop Science has
been part of the network since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined the network starting in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the cover crop network coordinator
based out of USDA Research Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Beltsville, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I came to Cornell in 2021,
I became the director of the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Solveig Hansen is the current network
coordinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a research support specialist housed
in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the network has been funded by several
different grant programs over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most central and most important
program for our network has been the
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic Research and Extension Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OREI supported the first grant that
started the network in 2015 and has funded
[SPEAKER_00]: two additional cycles of grants to support
the network since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also currently have a bigger
Sustainable Ag Systems CAP grant out of
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a project that includes our
breeding work, but also has a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: mission of increasing the production of
cover crop seeds in the US to support that
[SPEAKER_00]: expanded adoption and expanded acres of
cover crops that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since the inception of the network
in 2015, so we started out working on
[SPEAKER_00]: three winter annual legume species,
winter pea, hairy vetch, and crimson
[SPEAKER_00]: clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, added additional
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now also work on cereal rye and on
brassicas, primarily winter canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over that time period, in addition to
expanding the number of species,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've also expanded the number of sites in
the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of this past year, we have,
let's see, nine breeding locations across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have two farmer breeders that
participate in the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have breeding nurseries on their
farms based in the upper Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have 14 advanced line testing
locations, so testing early generation
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding material compared to commercial
checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as part of the new SASCAP
project, we also have 12 locations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are planting a variety of trials,
a larger scale, that are more focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cultivars and providing
recommendations to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this network represents the first
national effort to breed cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think, particularly important
to mention in the current political
[SPEAKER_00]: climate how important USDA collaborators
especially have been in the inception and
[SPEAKER_00]: continued success of the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work very closely with ARS breeders
who were involved in founding the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also work super closely with the
NRCS plant material centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are not familiar with the
PMC, they're about two dozen locations
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country in different
ecoregions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mandate is to evaluate plant
materials that are useful for conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that includes cover crops, but also
native species, things that are useful for
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration work, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have been really critical in,
they especially have contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced line testing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several locations are doing seed yield
trials and are providing seed increase
[SPEAKER_00]: services for us, so we have enough seed to
plant larger trials later in the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a really critical role for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, okay, so next I wanna talk about our
breeding pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of people here are not
plant breeders, and so I thought it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be useful to talk about what that looks
like for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go through this quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start by sourcing germplasm from a
variety of places and plant them in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have preliminary trials that are single
row plots planted at a few locations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and over time we expand to more locations
and larger plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have seed yield trials that we
plant at several different locations
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're now at the stage for a
couple of our crops, hairy vetch and
[SPEAKER_00]: winter pea, that we're moving towards
variety release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with seed companies to make
that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also wanted to mention we have
on-farm trials as of this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 locations across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this using SeedLynx,
which is an app to coordinate a
[SPEAKER_00]: participatory variety trials in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're planning to do more of that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentioning briefly that we're also doing
some evaluation for freezing tolerance in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have time to talk more in detail
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's work that's being led by my
graduate student, Raksha Thapa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So evaluating tolerance to freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are new chambers that were
installed this fall in Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been supported by several
grants, including an equipment grant and
[SPEAKER_00]: SARE and the Northern New York Ag
Development Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll wrap up by plugging a field day
that we're doing in late April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be hosted in conjunction
with the annual meeting for our network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there'll be cover crop breeders
from across the country here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll have an opportunity to engage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would encourage you to come if you're
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question for Jeannie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing chamber, do they allow to
freeze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they allow freezing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wrote this equipment grant to
install.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three chambers now that can go
to sub-zero temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are, I didn't have time to talk
more about it, but they are a shared use
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my grad student is using the chambers,
monopolizing them a little bit right now
[SPEAKER_00]: for her dissertation project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the future, I think starting to be
more available for other folks to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Lindsay Sneski.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am out of the horticulture section in
Geneva, New York at Cornell Agrotech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am the weed science extension
specialist for fruit and vegetable
[SPEAKER_02]: production here in New York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we talk about weeds,
weeds are problematic for lots of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think about the competitive
interactions that interfere with crop
[SPEAKER_02]: growth and yield production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're problematic for other reasons,
including the fact that they can serve as
[SPEAKER_02]: hosts for pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can physically contaminate our
yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is nightshade berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be a contaminant of peas and of
snap beans, which can impact the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to accept loads at the processors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can actually interfere with
harvestability.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are beets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can actually have weeds that are in the
row with beets that can actually interfere
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lifting and the cutting process,
which reduces harvest efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're frequently using herbicides for
weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need to think about why we need to
adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, pesticide development
is costly and slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can take hundreds of millions of
dollars in a decade or more to bring a new
[SPEAKER_02]: molecule from discovery to
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking with a Syngenta colleague.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, oh, I might have something
for you to test next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at 2035 for a product
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's effects of export market access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using certain herbicides might not allow
us access to, say, the European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's changing consumer perceptions
about pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's worker protection and
crop injury concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone has been following the EPA's new
strategy, for dealing with their
[SPEAKER_02]: obligations under the Endangered Species
Act, that's also going to complicate our
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's herbicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we think herbicide resistance is
being an issue in our agronomic crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production systems, we do have herbicide
resistant issues in vegetables as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking of herbicide resistance,
some of the work that my lab does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do herbicide trials and evaluations
for companies, for the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the IR4 project.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also look at the impacts of overuse
of herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is work from my graduate student,
Alia Butler-Jones.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is her master's work, where we
confirmed glyphosate resistance in a new
[SPEAKER_02]: weed problem here in New York State,
Palmer Amaranth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big problem throughout the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just started moving into the more
northern latitudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we published that paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working with Terry Bezoson,
Kyle Brunharo, and Jim Polishok.
[SPEAKER_02]: To now prepare the manuscript,
where we're characterizing atrazine
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance in these same populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be working with Vipin on
resistance to the ALS chemistries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides Palmer Amaranth, that was
primarily in our agronomic crop production
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, we do have, again, herbicide
resistance in our specialty crop systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a paper from my graduate student,
Bethany Schulteis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at horseweed, Origeron canadensis
in New York vineyards and orchards.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the growers in New York orchards
and vineyards are not comfortable using
[SPEAKER_02]: glyphosate because they're concerned about
crop injury.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of them have switched to using
Paraquat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the use of Paraquat has led to the
development of Paraquat resistance in our
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one here in the vineyard,
that's actually at Cornell Agritech.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been spraying that with Paraquat,
and they're like, it's not dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I've got an explanation for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have Paraquat resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have low levels of Diquat
resistance that are evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently working with Terry Bezoson
and Kyle Brunharo to characterize
[SPEAKER_02]: mesotrione resistance in our horseweed
populations as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do we need to look ahead?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we're not going to spray our
way out of our issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be thinking about what's
down the road, what kind of technology is
[SPEAKER_02]: available to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of focus on novel weed
management tools, such as robotic weeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three that we're looking at is
electrical weeding with Oregon State UC
[SPEAKER_02]: Davis, optical spraying with Rutgers,
and then laser weeding with Rutgers
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So electrical weeding, everyone expects
arcs and sparks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually my electrical weeder,
where we're using the mechanical energy
[SPEAKER_02]: from the tractor engine to power a
generator that charges the applicators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those applicators is right up in the
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the metal electrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, that flow of electricity
generates heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It disrupts cellular mechanisms,
leading to tissue death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that includes some crowns and roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is electrical weeding,
2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four hours after treatment, and then this
is one week after treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: My graduate student, Aaliyah Butler-Jones,
has been looking at it in our organic
[SPEAKER_02]: apple production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is funded by an organic research
and extension initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, she wanted to compare
electrical weeding to a commonly used
[SPEAKER_02]: practice, such as cultivation,
as well as organic herbicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the work she's been doing basically
shows is that we're getting better weed
[SPEAKER_02]: control of our perennial weed species
using electrical weeding compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's also done some work stacking
electrical weeding with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go in and do the electrical weeding
first, and then come back with
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation, we find we get even better
weed control, and it's much easier to run
[SPEAKER_02]: those cultivation events.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's still conducting research,
but right now, the data suggests we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have any kind of lasting impacts on the
soil biological communities, such as
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe diversity, microbacteria,
or soil microarthropods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing targeted spraying,
so vision-guided spraying work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some work that we started doing in
perennial crops, specifically in
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries and grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're using a system called the WEDIT
system from Agritech America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it just looks for chlorophyll
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it has that near-infrared signal,
it just turns on the nozzles that are
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with the location of where that
unwanted vegetation is in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've shown is that it's actually
very effective in our grapes and our
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries for controlling weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really interested in the
technology because it allows us to reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of herbicide we're applying
annually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that ability to reduce crop injury
potential that are associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: post-emergence applications because we
have less contact potential with the crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be able to evaluate new
herbicides that could control our
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide-resistant weeds or those
perennial weeds because of this enhanced
[SPEAKER_02]: safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And importantly, I mentioned the
Endangered Species Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using a vision-guided sprayer will be a
mitigation strategy for preventing
[SPEAKER_02]: off-target herbicide movement that can
threaten endangered, that can impact,
[SPEAKER_02]: threaten an endangered species or their
critical habitat because we're applying
[SPEAKER_02]: less herbicide to less acres using the
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also working with Terry Bates.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can see the weeds, can we see the
crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've actually been doing work with
Terry Bates saying, you know what,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can actually use this weed-it sprayer
to preferentially treat suckers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't need to have someone going
around either putting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the herbicides on continuously applying
and applying the herbicides where we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need it or having someone with a wand
having to go vine to vine to vine to vine
[SPEAKER_02]: to spray them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on that publication for
Hort technology on our weed sucker
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next step is actually putting our
weed-it system, our spray system on a
[SPEAKER_02]: fully automated little robot, training it
to where all the vineyard rows are and
[SPEAKER_02]: sending it off to do the whole process
automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting into the vision-guided
spraying in our vegetable systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been bothering this company for
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Verdant Robotics, please bring a unit to
New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please bring a unit to New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please bring a unit to New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to test a unit because our
growers are interested in it, but I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: give them guidance if I can't work with it
and see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a really unique vision-guided
spray system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's an AI-based models where
it sees the crops and it sees the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It discriminates between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rather than say like some of the
systems like the John Deere systems that
[SPEAKER_02]: just has a bank of nozzles that turn on
and off, Verdant Robotics actually has a
[SPEAKER_02]: turret that can move and turn and focus to
direct a concentrated stream right at the
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually the Verdant Robotics unit
operating in Organic Carrots out in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bolthouse Farms in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not lasers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually just lights showing you
how the turrets are moving and targeting
[SPEAKER_02]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The little insert here, you can see
exactly in these tiny little dark patches
[SPEAKER_02]: how precise the herbicide application is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have one grower in New York
who is looking to invest in this in 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Verdant Robotics has agreed to
bring a research unit this summer for us
[SPEAKER_02]: to do some trials with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we want to talk about the biggest
of the big of AI technology and targeted
[SPEAKER_02]: weed control, that would be Carbon
Robotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the only commercial laser weeding
company in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were founded in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: They manufactured their units in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They launched in early 22 with their first
version of their laser weeder really
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the large vegetable growers in
Arizona, California, the western United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they use high intensity bed top
lighting to illuminate and remove all the
[SPEAKER_02]: shadows so they get a clear view of all
the crops and the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with their AI deep learning models,
they discriminate between them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they have 150-watt CO2 lasers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their newer additions are now 240-watt
diodes with a millimeter accuracy that
[SPEAKER_02]: just shoot the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a video here that you can see
basically that's scanning the bed top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all the little pinpoints of light,
that is the lasers actually targeting the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual weeds in between the lettuce
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the lower part, you can see basically
the precision of going after meristematic
[SPEAKER_02]: and other tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were very lucky to work with their
research and demo unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one that was in operation in
the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We conducted trials in New York,
in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at laser weeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I purposely looked at beets, spinach,
and peas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We compared laser weeding to a commonly
used pre-emergence herbicide,
[SPEAKER_02]: S-metolachlor, also known as dual magnum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We looked at the laser weeding alone or in
partnership with the dual magnum.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want you to focus on is look at the
difference in the crop sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much the pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this trial, one of the things we were
really able to see is how much under our
[SPEAKER_02]: growing conditions, the dual magnum held
our small seeded crops back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had really warm, temperatures,
and really intense downpours that led to
[SPEAKER_02]: crusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the dual magnum was actually
holding back the beets and the spinach
[SPEAKER_02]: from the emergence, they weren't able to
break out of the crust as easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also took up the herbicide and it
resulted in season long stunting in these
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this isn't necessarily out of the
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't a function of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had several growers who had to replant
fields last year for this exact same
[SPEAKER_02]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that the laser weeding was as
effective as our herbicide applications
[SPEAKER_02]: for early season weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we got that boost in the crop
vigor in the absence of the pre-emergence
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry got similar results in New Jersey
and we're currently preparing this for
[SPEAKER_02]: pest management science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also leveraged this for a moonshot
grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Null, Kristi Hoop Ting, and we're
working with Torrey Farms to see if we can
[SPEAKER_02]: kill many birds with one stone using laser
weeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tories have two commercial laser
weeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which come in at a cool of $1.6 million
each.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, we know that a laser
weeding can affect weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know it can improve crop vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can improve onion vigor by taking
some of the more injurious onion
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicides out of the program,
can we also potentially reduce thrips
[SPEAKER_02]: damage and then the incidence and severity
of stem thillium leaf blight.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last thing I'll talk about is
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology is great, but we have to ask a
lot of questions about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology doesn't absolve us from being
good weed managers, being good farm
[SPEAKER_02]: managers, being good stewards.
[SPEAKER_02]: These tools and technologies are going to
impart selection pressures on our weed
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to be aware of who wins because
someone always wins and it's not us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to think about costs, the units
themselves, but also parts and services
[SPEAKER_02]: and then adaptability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not a small California.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I'll say is we have to
really talk about infrastructure and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory readiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our technology is advancing a lot faster
than say the EPA can keep up with writing
[SPEAKER_02]: herbicide labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to thank my lab and I want
to thank all the funding sources that are
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting our research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
