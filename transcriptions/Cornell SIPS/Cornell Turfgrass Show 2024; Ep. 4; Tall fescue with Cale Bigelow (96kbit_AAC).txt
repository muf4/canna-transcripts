[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you all can see, watching us and
live or the video or listen to us on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast, we're joined by Dr. Cal Bigelow,
professor and leader of the Turfgrass
[SPEAKER_02]: Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the leaders, I think the leader,
certainly in the teaching area of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Purdue Turfgrass Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to tell everybody,
Cal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to make a big deal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say, as we get started,
I'm starting to get worried now that dogs
[SPEAKER_02]: are starting to have to work a fair
amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not really considering them as
the labor force.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you know, Carl, we started out with
a skin machine and then a San Pro,
[SPEAKER_02]: now running robots, changing cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem to be any end to what will
get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're in a mood for a little bit
of calamity, I will, if anybody is willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to take that code down and send money in,
I'll be happy to send a picture of you
[SPEAKER_02]: with me having a pie thrown in my face by
my ag science students, which I know will
[SPEAKER_02]: do it with great love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll also sort of entree into our
conversation today, Carl, about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on this spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And particularly, the story is obviously
wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walked around the beautiful
Lakeshore Golf and Yacht Club yesterday up
[SPEAKER_02]: along Lake Oneida with the Walk and Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw a fair amount of this out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the spring is upon us.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts about the growing
season getting going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we talked about
yesterday, Frank, and we've seen some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of chatter about it on various social
media platforms, is golf course
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendents opening earlier,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this idea that the growing season is
extending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the NRCC folks, they've got some
really good visuals of how this has
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what people could see on the screen is
the last spring frost date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of an indication of, I know for
gardeners who are putting veggies in,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, they got to get them in
after that last frost in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see how this has sort of
shifted earlier into the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that last spring frost is happening a
little bit earlier, about three to seven
[SPEAKER_01]: days earlier, depending on where you're
looking there on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the fall, when the first fall
frost happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sort of last frost in the spring
to first frost in the fall is sort of that
[SPEAKER_01]: growing season we can think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fall, it seems to be extending
even more than the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three to seven days earlier on the
spring, seven to 10 days later in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this means is it's just a longer
growing season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more time that we're managing turf,
whether it's golf course superintendents,
[SPEAKER_01]: sports field managers, or the landscapers
getting out there earlier on the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually for me as a golfer,
the best way to think about when the
[SPEAKER_01]: season starts is, Frank, can I play golf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just tell me when I can play golf?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the growing season starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have data from the pollution folks
who have an algorithm that calculates when
[SPEAKER_01]: is the weather that's conducive to golf?
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 degrees, the forecast has to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be some light out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding is in New York and
in the data we have, we're getting this
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity for rounds, these days when you
can play golf out there in January,
[SPEAKER_01]: in February, in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even upstate here in New York,
these are just three locations for folks
[SPEAKER_01]: watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is indeed getting better,
easier to play golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shoulders of the season,
the golfers want to go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I go prepare the golf course for
the golfers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not, if you get stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like here's a picture of full disclosure,
this is me getting stuck a couple of years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago on the Cornell golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get out there, getting data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, it's ready to go right into the mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes hand in hand with some other
things we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The percentage of rain we're getting
relative to normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these northeastern states there,
140%, 200% of normal so far this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In March, so we got our golfers wanting to
play golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's warm, but we got a lot of moisture
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, should I open?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I let golfers on my golf course?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some cool traffic research out in
Oregon state, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Northwest is sort of right on the
edge of being able to play golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those winter months, they decided
to, hey, we're going to simulate traffic
[SPEAKER_01]: at different levels, 110, 220 rounds,
140 rounds per day on polar greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's see what the turf quality looks
like from January through March.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they found was, hey, even at 110
rounds per day, those polar greens hold up
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once you get to 220 rounds,
it declines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you going to do 220 rounds in the
winter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what this research says is,
man, if I got polar greens, like it's okay
[SPEAKER_01]: if they go on the greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably more worried about tees and
like you showed Frank, a cart traffic,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe our maintenance workers,
or if you got me running around in your
[SPEAKER_01]: golf course, maybe I shouldn't be out
there in a cart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to say, Carl, yeah, this is
really important work because as climates
[SPEAKER_02]: change, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have these longer golfing seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about rounds per day is,
and we've learned this, not everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: studies it the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you got to move the cup around,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able to tolerate this on a
cumulative basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you might have pinch points that
if everybody's walking in the same spot
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time, it might only be 100 rounds
a day or 50 rounds a day that could cause
[SPEAKER_02]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say, Carl, before you move on,
we also saw a fair amount of damage from
[SPEAKER_02]: the workers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The workers themselves getting out there
doing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, you know, from the athletics
point of view, you've also got kids who
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get out there and play their
sports early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: K through 12, you're playing sports in the
fall and the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when growth is low too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 45 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great day if it's sunny to get
out there and kick a soccer ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is the grass growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what you see with community
athletic fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get compacted early on, bare ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: What fills in probably crab grass that
craps out early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you basically never have a safe or
high quality athletic field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran across this, this presentation from
a California school district, Frank,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got these really interesting
numbers on field use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where these came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't find any citations, but they said
in their presentation, they're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: should we have synthetic or natural grass?
[SPEAKER_01]: A perfectly maintained field can handle 10
hours per day of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not every hour for every sport is
equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's football, that's worth like two
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just, you know, softball or
baseball, that's worth an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're basically looking at,
Hey, if I have more than that use,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's perfectly maintained,
I probably need synthetic and not natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's take a look at that in March and
April in New York, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it withstand two hours a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the argument for synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially up here, where we have those
wet conditions when it is warm enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: play, but not warm enough to grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe one of the other solutions,
and this is where we bring in Kale today,
[SPEAKER_01]: is maybe you select different varieties,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some research in the mid 2000s
that you guys did with fertilizer timings,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also the turf varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've certainly seen this over the
years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kentucky bluegrass, often selected on
sports fields, but doesn't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: spring green up or the growth early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not growing as early in the season
there, like a perennial ryegrass or a turf
[SPEAKER_01]: type tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see there in the data,
there's the yield rates over there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: far right-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what you see is April and
May, the yield, the amount the grass is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow is much higher for perennial
ryegrass or turf type tall fescue than
[SPEAKER_01]: Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means it's going to handle the
traffic better, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the, you know,
maybe the solutions, synthetic teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got golfers out there and you
don't want to have divots, little Matt,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe that helps on the sports field side.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a synthetic sort of
swing field to get people to, maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: start thinking about these different
varieties or fertilizing differently in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fall and maybe optimizing that timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some research on that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, Carl, I had this slide,
I'm going towards the end of what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to talk about, set Kale up,
but Carl, since you brought it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Kale, we were raised in the sort
of turf grass world with, this is how cool
[SPEAKER_02]: season grasses grow, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, you know, we're talking
about sort of relative rate of vertical
[SPEAKER_02]: extension and relative rate of root growth
or depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deeper the roots, the more it's
growing, the taller the pulse above,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more it's growing on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we were taught.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to Carl's point about color and yield
and green up, I don't know if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually the same study or not,
but I used it in another presentation and
[SPEAKER_02]: kept the sort of thing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was, I think, some data that you
generated as well, where you were
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting clippings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you see tall fescue and even
Kentucky bluegrass to be more of a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not a multiple pulse of growth,
but rather sort of a most of it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: spring and almost, you know, relatively
speaking, you wouldn't call it a blip in
[SPEAKER_02]: the autumn, you'd call it more of a blip
in the summer, if you were saying growth
[SPEAKER_02]: was surging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start here with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk a little bit about what your
observations have been over the years with
[SPEAKER_02]: tall fescue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'll get to the weather and stuff in
a minute, but Carl set you up really good
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to comment for a second about
this work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, I think, you know,
this, this definitely falls a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends bucket a bit too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that study that, you highlighted,
you know, that was early in my career
[SPEAKER_00]: here, you know, that's, that's a good 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were using improved tall fescue at
that time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you well know, over the last 20
years, the advances on the tall fescue has
[SPEAKER_00]: been tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I think that we saw was,
you know, some of those earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: generations of the tall fescue was they
still had some heritage towards their
[SPEAKER_00]: forage type friends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you had that, that spring pulse
that was happening, but what I,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I also think is important here is the
fact that, you know, you had that growth
[SPEAKER_00]: flush in the spring, but it's also that
sustaining of growth into the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: months, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of our newer tall
fescue and again, you know, the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: that recently graduated with me,
Dr. Palin doing all her work on the Brown
[SPEAKER_00]: patch and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some really good
information there, but she's about to
[SPEAKER_00]: publish a study looking at, you know,
leaf elongation rates and how that affects
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be some really
interesting information that'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature, but those are these most
recent generations of tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that with, you know,
what you're seeing on that big blip in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, that's probably going to come down
a little bit as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing you're seeing,
and ultimately it comes down to those
[SPEAKER_00]: images you were showing as far as shoot
density, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these tall fescue or rye grasses or
whatever you're using, as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining the density, that's,
that's probably going to be a good part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have you back to talk
about, maybe we're going to get Jada to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you need to get Jada on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be happy to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Brown patch thing, because,
you know, that's this thing about
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially regulating growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people have said this from
herbicides and maybe creating problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: having tree barrier down, limiting growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the use of whether PGRs do
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much PGRs we use tall
fescue in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me, let me get to, let me get back
here to the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got some more, we got more tall
fescue to talk about, Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two inch soil temperature back
three weeks ago now was barely creeping
[SPEAKER_02]: into the low upper forties, low fifties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to get all the way down into Cal's
old neck of the woods down to Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: Tech where you were even making it to 60
degrees three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But things haven't started to advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just last week we were in the,
you know, up, you know, mid mid fifties to
[SPEAKER_02]: mid sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this week we've seen a
little bit of a sort of moving North
[SPEAKER_02]: still, but the temperatures are sort of
holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the mid forties to the
North and lows the low sixties in the
[SPEAKER_02]: South.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost feeling like we're a little
bit further ahead next week, last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to watch the colors with these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that use the forecast
website, make sure you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: colors because sometimes they change
depending on what you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's depending on the scale below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is temperature departure three
weeks ago where we were cooler than
[SPEAKER_02]: normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you really started to see a stall
that normal stall we see occur,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially along the coast relative to the
30 year normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now most recently it looks like it's
been warm along the lakes and cooler along
[SPEAKER_02]: the Atlantic coast, but certainly a little
bit above normal when you get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: Philly, you know, Maryland, Virginia,
Delmarva area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's consistently been wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a few weeks ago and now we're
seeing it continue to be a little bit wet,
[SPEAKER_02]: but more wet to the West.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, a lot of the Western part of
the region needed that moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Thad Thompson yesterday came to the
walk and talk from Buffalo and he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got a bunch of rain, so we're good
for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'll just draw attention to one of the
interesting tools Carl has built for the
[SPEAKER_02]: forecast website, looking at dandelion and
clover flowering, this pollinator risk
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment tool, and it's projecting out
to April 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that the pollinator risk
is growing into central New Jersey and all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way into the metropolitan New York
area where dandelions are gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see that the green area is moving
out, which means the risk is growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the old growing degree day model for
spring dandelion control that was
[SPEAKER_02]: developed years ago that we still use sort
of as a marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that where it's red in the
pollinator risk assessment to the South,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see it green for weed control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we might recommend this,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna be very careful about the way we
manage these herbicide applications when
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollinator risk is a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a really important point
to consider when you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: using these tools and making any
application to the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now moving forward, looks like it's gonna
be as Art told us this morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of a carbon copy of the
previous week, a little warmish and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little wetish with sort of the eighth to
14 day bringing us around normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looks like we might get a little bit of
a cool move through in the next few days,
[SPEAKER_02]: but otherwise looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the growing degree day differences are
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is something that maybe
we need to think about changing Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is collecting the growing degree days
basis from March 15th, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we usually start to think we can start
collecting degree days then, but we may be
[SPEAKER_02]: accumulating some before then,
obviously the spring with a very mild
[SPEAKER_02]: winter progresses fairly rapidly,
but it still indicates we're behind last
[SPEAKER_02]: year's accumulation in that time period
and at or near normal, except for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: North Eastern areas that are well behind
the 30s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the year normal, the Boston
area, a lot of Massachusetts, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: in Dutchess and Orange County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So phenological indicators, we've been
staring at the forsythia already for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use this as a measure of
determining crabgrass control,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether we're gonna put our pre-emergence
down and where kale is in Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana, they're well along crabgrass
germination there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still are on the early phases of it,
but I would say in the New York
[SPEAKER_02]: metropolitan area and South, now's the
time to get that pre-emergent down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the pre-emergent model was telling
you to put it out maybe even two weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're at that point now where you
probably should get your pre in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground, but you wanna watch out for all
the water in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we were talking to people this
morning telling us, and I've showed
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures already, we've seen pictures that
you make a mess when you're getting out
[SPEAKER_02]: there trying to work this time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Lee Miller, a new addition to the
Purdue team over the last few years,
[SPEAKER_02]: kale, now continues to send out this
update.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, like I see, the National
Phenology Network indicating that spring
[SPEAKER_02]: is really coming through very early,
20 days in some places.
[SPEAKER_02]: The forsythias are flowering and getting
along.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, this was a picture I think I used
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take these lovely pictures roughly
from the same spot every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you got a mark on it or
something that you keep going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly the same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was last year, and it's been a little
bit of up and down, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I wanted to turn your
attention to and ask you to speculate a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having these fall, spring,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where she warms up and gets going,
and then you get that dump of snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see this in the literature where
we've adopted this name, fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get this extended warming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get vulnerable plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until Eric Watkins,
did some of this work with fall springs
[SPEAKER_02]: and the potential impact it can have on
turf type tall fescues that I started to
[SPEAKER_02]: even think that this was problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that same stuff that we were just
talking about, kale, let's start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts about how the tall
fescues have evolved away from that forage
[SPEAKER_02]: type?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's making it more
susceptible to this kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'd love to hear your thoughts about
the potential injury that these persistent
[SPEAKER_02]: fall springs might have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously it doesn't look like one day is
too much problem, but five days of pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: nasty weather looks like it would set the
tall fescue back significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: An obvious question here, Frank,
would be what was the maturity of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is it the kind of thing that this
was something that was seeded in September
[SPEAKER_00]: and then subject to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have historically here the last several
fall had that extended fall with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: warm temperatures all the way into
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's some folks that
are still trying to seed at that time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the same token, there's individuals
that are seeding in September,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've had that warmer fall and drier
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have irrigation and can't
get that plant established, I could easily
[SPEAKER_00]: see this happening certainly with the tall
fescues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mature stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mature stands probably are not
gonna be as susceptible to what you see
[SPEAKER_00]: there on the far right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen as much of that,
but periodically my program does a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar and species evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a little bit on some ryegrass too a
couple of years ago.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not necessarily, when we're
mature, trading off this potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, some of us, one of the
reasons I think annual bluegrass dies in
[SPEAKER_02]: the springtime is of course it breaks
dormancy and then the temperatures drop,
[SPEAKER_02]: hardening breaks down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just wondering if this is sort of
a harbinger for things, but I know one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the things you've written about for the
sod growers particularly, and even the
[SPEAKER_02]: general public, hey, tall fescue is maybe
a good companion plant in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: plantings, pollinator plantings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also really good for keeping weeds
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you get a good stand, they tend to be
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've talked about and visited
this study that Doug's had going on out
[SPEAKER_02]: there in Wisconsin for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug sold that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk a little bit about sort of
your feelings about, let's start with tall
[SPEAKER_02]: fescue as a sort of pretty good at keeping
weeds out, even at relatively low
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll talk about how it's maybe
good companion planting and pollinator
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, when you start to think
about these lower maintenance lawns and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I did have a chance to visit
this site last summer and saw kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they have been doing for a number of years
there at Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that study is good 10 years old
now, as far as these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you could still see that
that stand of tall fescue that had been
[SPEAKER_00]: planted there, especially, you know,
on the lower maintenance side with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, two fertilizer applications a
year, you know, it was really holding
[SPEAKER_00]: stand density quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm giving an exam in about
two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the questions there
is, you know, how do you minimize,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the reliance on pesticides and
lawns?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes back to cultivate a dense
healthy turf, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so choosing the right plant,
the right place, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: having tall fescue as part of our lawn,
you know, blends or mixes seems to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sense that we've got a lot of
evidence there.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the knocks I tried to get to the
early spring thing, I'm trying to break
[SPEAKER_02]: down some of the pushback I get.
[SPEAKER_02]: How worried about, because you have much
more intense brown patch pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, than we do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really in the transition zone for
all intents and purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The line is getting further and further
where you're included in it pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly all the time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think maybe in the past,
I don't know, but for sure, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with the potential brown patch
susceptibility in the trials maybe that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we getting better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it superficial or is that we still got
some work to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got a couple of things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks in that Southern Indiana,
the Ohio River Valley, that's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, you know, prime time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably almost as bad as a place
like Raleigh where they're trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some nice granular products,
you know, the ones that have the asoxy
[SPEAKER_00]: strobin, those are, you know, almost a
gold standard as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression of brown patch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still comes back to timing of that
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so from the lawn care side,
there are some granular products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, and again,
I strongly encourage, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dragging Jada onto this show to have her
talk about her stuff she did for her PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the range of susceptibility
on the cultivars, I mean, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really highly resistant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so choosing those highly resistant
cultivars, including them in a blend or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of the other things that,
you know, she and I've kicked around is,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you intercede or oversee that superior
cultivar into an existing turf to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: change some of the species dynamics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I genuinely think that's a potential
option for some of these lawn situations.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a couple of things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've obviously looked at this a little
bit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we took all your work, which has
been substantial now, not just with Jada,
[SPEAKER_02]: but other students have come and you've
been evaluating these things for years
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the cells, when I got here to
the Northeast 28 years ago, after being in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Midwest for a while, when I got back
here to the Northeast and I brought tall
[SPEAKER_02]: fescue with me because I'm like,
man, these things look really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, it's looks like it's going
to get drier here in the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not been very dry actually the
last several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, I like the fact that if
you gave tall fescue a halfway decent
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to put some roots down,
it was going to root pound for pound
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper than just about everything else you
could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that rooting is where the resilience
lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk a little bit, start with a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like a turf type tall fescue sod
that's 90-10 with the bluegrass there as a
[SPEAKER_02]: good solid approach to establishing,
generally assuming you got the right
[SPEAKER_02]: place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like that or are you still okay
with just put the sod and then intercede
[SPEAKER_02]: the tall fescue in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been talking to some of these
developers recently, because I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: some situations, some of these new
communities, they're mandating sodding the
[SPEAKER_00]: front lawns, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This company comes in, they buy the land,
they put in the three or four bedroom
[SPEAKER_00]: house and it's about having sort of the
eight, the homeowners association do their
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, a lot of times the sod
growers locally, a lot of them just only
[SPEAKER_00]: have the Kentucky bluegrasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think interceding into that existing
lawn is an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually more of an option than I had
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if some of these developers can
interact with the sod growers and ask for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these tall fescue as a sod,
that's one way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd almost rather see you start with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so wait, now you're bringing up a
better point, because it sounds like you
[SPEAKER_02]: were not hopeful that you were going to
get much establishment from interceding
[SPEAKER_02]: tall fescue in, because we get a lot of
people come with the lawn from hell,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to fix this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering if what you think is
tall fescue is just good to stitch into
[SPEAKER_02]: any cool season grass lawn to maybe make
it more resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I worry a little bit about the
clumpiness of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of the reason you didn't
think interceding was going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it didn't get as clumpy as you
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of it mindset was going way
back to even some of the work that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might have done and Dan Bowman had done
trying to intercede those bent grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: into putting greens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to improve cultivars that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mindset and frame of reference from
that was that it's a numbers game and the
[SPEAKER_00]: existing big bullies of grasses are going
to crowd out any seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different system,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that putting green is a way
different system in this lawn situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you're doing some fall
seedings and those mowing intervals
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly stretch from being seven days to
14 days and giving those seedlings a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential opportunity to establish in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your point about the clumpiness,
that is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is a possibility,
especially if you're doing a 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you commit to a two or three year
type of process, I think maybe that's less
[SPEAKER_00]: of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one and done, you're probably going to
see some clumpiness, potential clumpiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing before we turn it over for
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the water issue that I've got
up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tall fescue, I assume, will hold up
longer with less water than a bluegrass
[SPEAKER_02]: will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've also learned that blue grasses
don't sell them short.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of good blue grasses that
can still hold up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your feeling about, because I see
the bluegrass is improving and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: leave the Pro Vista technology out for
now, but I see the bluegrass is improving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still wonder what your thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is tall fescue pound for pound still a
better manager of drought conditions than
[SPEAKER_02]: bluegrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it kind of comes back to
consumer mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like this study, we had to kind of
settle on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see there, we had 70% digital
green colors, what we were working with as
[SPEAKER_00]: that point where the lawn owner is going
to try and flip on the irrigation system
[SPEAKER_00]: or do something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the right study, I think what
was really cool about this was our blue
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses, they were hitting that 70% green
cover somewhere around 18 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tall fescue were closer to like 40,
42 days before without any irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hanging on staying green for 40,
that's over a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy talk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what I was hoping to
hear you say, because we've seen this
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty consistently that if the consumer
mindset says, I'm not worried about this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing until it's 70%, that's only 70%
green, that changes the game for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think one of the problems is
we've assumed everything's got to be dark
[SPEAKER_02]: blue green, completely weed free.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think now the consumer mindset is
changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think, Carl?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the hour here, our fastest 30
minutes went by in 32 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you like for a question or a
comment before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think Vitas has a good question
and speaks to sort of the application in
[SPEAKER_01]: sports turf fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Frank, I know when you got here to
Cornell, you thought, man, tall fescue,
[SPEAKER_01]: we should be using this for athletic
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have concerns about its wear
tolerance, does it get thin and can it
[SPEAKER_01]: spread?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Vitas is asking, does it have any
laterally spreading ability can it hold up
[SPEAKER_01]: there or do you need to intercede pretty
frequently to sort of account for that
[SPEAKER_01]: wear tolerance?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for you, Cal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna let me take that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna let you tell me if tall fescue
has rhizomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we both know, and we've all seen
the marketing information is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some that are weakly rhizomatous,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they do spread out and that's been
documented that they do spread,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not as aggressive as one of
these improved Kentucky blue grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: that's used on some of these athletic
field mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're just, those are really
aggressive, but they also are higher
[SPEAKER_00]: thatch formers too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you're trading things off sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing on the athletic field side
with a tall fescue is where I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of market confusion
is that you can't take them down in
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting height, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just actually published another paper,
Jada and I published another paper looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at potential fairway grasses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the rock stars in that paper
was we had some type tall fescue at a half
[SPEAKER_00]: an inch in our rain out shelter for
multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea that may be on say middle
school or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they want to maintain a field at an
inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our tall fescue are probably a
reasonable or something in our athletic
[SPEAKER_00]: field mix, tall fescue bluegrass mix at an
inch and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet you could do it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I would worry a little bit about the
canopy opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that already out?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published that about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send it to you and Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else, Carl?
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get them out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got one more from Rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember Cale last year,
last time we had you on, we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: the micro clover mixes and Rich,
I remember sent me Rich Bradley out and
[SPEAKER_01]: Cape Cod sent me a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had 90% turf type tall fescue and 10%
clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it got taken over by the clover
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said the site's 50, 50 sunshade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember asking him, Hey, did you not
fertilize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Oh, fertilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thinks he got too much water there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also got brown patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts on, on sort of what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it could be all over the map,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and even when we've dealt with
the micro clovers here, going back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: patchiness Frank, uh, I think what those
people that are dealing with those
[SPEAKER_00]: clovers, there's the potential for that
patchiness to develop in, in those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the clovers, I think there's a lot we
need to learn about the clovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from pests, you know,
disease and insect pests that could cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the right
conditions, like you said, sort of cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: and wetter and that clover can just,
it's a viney weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could, they could move.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, well let's wrap it up there,
Frank and we got, we could go all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% DGCI last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're measuring that out in our
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I like 60, like, I don't mind
60.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, thanks for joining us,
Cal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make sure to put this on my annual
report engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See everybody next Thursday.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
university on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
We'll see you next time.
