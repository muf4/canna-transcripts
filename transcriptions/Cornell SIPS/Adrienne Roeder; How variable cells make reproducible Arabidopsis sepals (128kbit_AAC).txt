[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bill, for that very kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the microphone on and can you hear me?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a real pleasure to be here today
to tell you about the last five years of
[SPEAKER_01]: work in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's no way I can tell you about
all the last five years of work in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd be here all afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to focus on a couple of
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the real themes emerging from
the research in my lab is the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of variability in plant development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you two stories
about variability today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And variability is something we don't
often think about as biologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we kind of sweep under the
rug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do our experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a number of replicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the average.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the air bars on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope the air bars are small and that's
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the theme emerging from my lab's
research is that the variability is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really important and we need to
pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the fundamental... Maybe we
should... Is that okay with everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we try this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the fundamental characteristics of
all organisms is their size.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the giant sequoia tree to the small
flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the wolfia or the mouse to the
elephant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the organ size needs to follow the
organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a mouse has a very small liver,
whereas an elephant has a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago in Science Magazine,
the question of how do organs know when
[SPEAKER_01]: they've reached the right size and decide
to stop growing is one of the fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: mysteries in developmental biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fundamentally, organ size is really
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's controlled by the number and size of
the cells in the organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, in theory, if you just increase
the cell number, you'll get a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you increase the cell size,
you'll get a bigger organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as probably most of you know,
reality is nowhere near this simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closely related species often have
different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Arabidopsis thaliana flower and
here's Arabidopsis lyrata flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that they have the same organs
in the flower, but the sizes are different
[SPEAKER_01]: since the Arabidopsis thaliana petal is
much smaller than the Arabidopsis lyrata
[SPEAKER_01]: petal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been said that size is the
material that evolution largely works on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the field's really in the dark about
how this happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know the mechanisms of how size
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since it's worked on by evolution,
it means that there has to be some genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: control, which gives us a handle to get in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a single species, size is very
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are Arabidopsis thaliana petals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see they're all the same size
and shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're thinking about plants,
we think about organs like floral organs
[SPEAKER_01]: as petals, sepals, stamens, carpals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the fundamental questions is how
do organs form with a reproducible size
[SPEAKER_01]: and shape?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very broad question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It applies to us humans and it applies to
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as humans, you can think about your two
arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your two arms are the same length with a
precision of 0.02.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about when you're
developing, when you're a small child,
[SPEAKER_01]: your arms are also the same length.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you become an adult,
they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout that period, they maintain
the same length.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing is true in plants in
sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sepal is the outermost green
leaf-like floral organ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing the sepal does is grow
and protect the floral meristem and the
[SPEAKER_01]: developing reproductive organs inside the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are four sepals on each
Arabidopsis flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those four sepals have to be the same
size to enclose the flower and protect the
[SPEAKER_01]: bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start out very small and they have to
maintain the same size throughout their
[SPEAKER_01]: growth as the flower is developing from
the young sepals here in the middle to the
[SPEAKER_01]: older sepals out here to maintain this
closure and protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's four sepals from a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see they're really very similar
size and shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes the reproducibility of organ
size particularly mysterious is the
[SPEAKER_01]: finding in many organisms that cells are
highly variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we take sepals as an example,
sepals have highly variable cell size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got this beautiful pattern of
giant cells, which I've false colored here
[SPEAKER_01]: in red, interspersed between a whole range
of smaller cell sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a ton of variability in cell
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a ton of variability in
growth rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I'm showing you a heat map of a
young developing sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to show you a bunch of heat
maps throughout the talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, red is growing fast and blue
is growing slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see there's a ton of
variability in these cells and their
[SPEAKER_01]: growth rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got cells that are growing fast
right next to cells that are growing very
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we think about plant cells,
their growth is regulated by the cell wall
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics and the turgor pressure inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we also have looked at cell wall
mechanics and find that they're highly
[SPEAKER_01]: variable as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in collaboration with the Rezki Boulud
and Matil Douman, we did atomic force
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopy to look at the cell wall
mechanical properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another heat map.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, red is stiff and blue is
soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've traced the outlines of the cells
here in black over the AFM data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that we've got soft,
stiff patches right next to soft patches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a ton of variability in the
cell wall properties as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the cellular level and even
subcellular level, we see a ton of
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we go from this cellular
variability to get regular organs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Arabidopsis sepal is a
particularly good model system for looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at this question, particularly because
it's relatively invariant to environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the future, of course, we want to
understand how the environment actually
[SPEAKER_01]: regulates growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to start, we need to understand growth
to begin with without the input of the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So floral organs are relatively invariant
to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower is also particularly good
because it has four sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows us to compare organ size
within a single flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, there's 60 to 100 flowers per
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can really get a statistical
analysis of sepal size within a single
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, it's accessible for live
imaging and manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the experiments that we love to
do in my lab is live imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take our living plant, attach it to
a slide, stuff it under the confocal
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, and take an image.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it back in the growth
chamber, let it grow for another 6,
[SPEAKER_01]: 8, 12 hours, depending on the experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it back on the microscope
and image the same sepal again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's just an example of a few cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the nuclei marked in gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plasma memories are really faint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're also in gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's three cells here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And six hours later, this cell has divided
to make two cells here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cell has divided to make these two
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this cell has just grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can track what's going on in each of
the cells over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of that live imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the sepal is growing
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nuclei are moving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cells are dividing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in collaboration with Gerardo Tariello
and Petros Komozakos, we developed a
[SPEAKER_01]: method for tracking the cell lineages,
so tracking each cell and all of its
[SPEAKER_01]: descendants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've colored each cell and its
descendants by the same color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here that this giant cell
that formed never underwent any divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all one cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this purple patch here went through a
lot of divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's many cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We incorporated this into the
Morphographic software package that
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Smith developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been published in eLife.
[SPEAKER_01]: as part of the Morphographic software
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main question is, how does cellular
variability give rise to organ regularity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two sides of this question
that I'm going to look at today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is, what mechanisms generate the
cellular variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the work of my graduate
student, Heather Meyer, who just defended
[SPEAKER_01]: her PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second question is, how do
variable cells produce uniform organs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the work of my postdoc,
Dr. Leland Hong.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so let's start with this first
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get this cell variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to look at this as a typical
patterning question and ask particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: about giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get the pattern of giant cells
interspersed between small cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we think about this in a
developmental patterning setting,
[SPEAKER_01]: we think about we've got a small immature
sepal primordium where the cells are all
[SPEAKER_01]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does a single cell decide it's
going to become a giant cell or it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to become a small cell?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone always asks me, what's the
purpose of giant cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an effect on organ curvature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a wild type sepal, we've got
interspersed giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sepal straighten up when the
flower blooms and protect the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have plants with too many giant
cells, then the sepal splay outward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they open up too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that developing flower bud is not
protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not protecting the base here
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have sepals with no giant cells,
they have a very subtle inward curvature
[SPEAKER_01]: defect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're curved too much inward.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not straightening up as the flower
blooms to sit nicely along the base of the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we have a double mutant that loses
giant cells, then the sepals start to roll
[SPEAKER_01]: up on themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's completely rolling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of this, it's not protecting
the flower very well either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So giant cells have a role in sepal
curvature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've previously shown that giant cells
form through a specialized cell cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: called endoraduplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the normal cell cycle, cells grow
in G1, replicate their DNA in S phase,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in G2, and then divide in M phase and
keep on going through the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: During endoraduplication, cells exit the
mitotic cell cycle and grow, replicate
[SPEAKER_01]: their DNA, and grow and keep on growing
and replicating their DNA, becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: enlarged and polyploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you get these big giant
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we measure DNA content using flow
cytometry to measure how many endocycles
[SPEAKER_01]: is undergone, we can see we have two C
diploid cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They replicate their DNA once to four C,
twice to eight C, three times to 16 C,
[SPEAKER_01]: or four times to 32 C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's these 16 C and 32 C cells that
are the giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at the relationship between
DNA content and cells area, we find that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's linearly correlated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the giant cells are the 16 C cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from our previous live imaging data,
we've seen how these giant cells form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we take two, and I'm going to show
you a very simplified model here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take two C diploid cells in our
sepal primordium, they replicate their DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: to four C during the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these two divide, they go back to being
two C diploid cells, whereas if this one
[SPEAKER_01]: underreduplicates, it becomes a four C
cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now once a cell underreduplicates,
it generally cannot go back and divide
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to underreduplicate again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this four C cell underreduplicates to
be an eight C cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cell maybe decides to
underreduplicate and become a four C cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the rest of the cells might decide to
divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the next cell cycle, this eight C cell
is going to become a 16 C giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This four C cell is going to become an
eight C cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this cell underreduplicates to
become a four C cell and the rest divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you can see here is that the
pattern of cell sizes develops just based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the time at which each cell decides to
underreduplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it decides to underreduplicate very
early, it becomes very large and becomes a
[SPEAKER_01]: giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it underreduplicates late, it does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we've got one answer to our
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get this variability?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by variability in the timing of
underreduplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still leaves us with another
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does an individual cell decide whether
it's going to divide and become small or
[SPEAKER_01]: underreduplicate and become large?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start to get at this question,
when I was a postdoc, I started a mutant
[SPEAKER_01]: screen, and we finished this mutant screen
in my lab, looking for mutants that affect
[SPEAKER_01]: giant cell formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've pulled out quite a number of
mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a cell cycle regulator that we'll
come back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of mutants in the
epidermal specification pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was quite a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one mutant with ectopic
giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's involved in subcellular trafficking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the work of my first graduate
student, Shen, and he published a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: plant physiology paper on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today I want to focus on the ATML1
gene and the ATML1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the ATML1 mutant completely
lacks giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATML1 encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper
transcription factor, and it's involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: epidermal specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the protein structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a homeodomain, a leucine zipper
domain, and a start domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATML1 is expressed throughout the
epidermis, including in young sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a young sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's expressed in all that
outer layer of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATML1 is well-known for its role in
epidermal specification based on the work
[SPEAKER_01]: of Avi et al, who found that ATML
mutations in ATML1 and its sister gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: PDF2, cause a loss of epidermal identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wild type, we've got a scanning
electron micrograph, and we're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: down on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see here's the epidermis,
and it's been peeled back to reveal the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesophyll cells underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ATML1 PDF2 double mutant,
the poor plant has its mesophyll exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no epidermis overlying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's amazing is that those plants
will actually germinate on soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they desiccate and croak.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty bad not to have an epidermis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, if you overexpress ATML1
throughout all the cell layers,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you start to get epidermal cell types
forming in the internal layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a wild type cotyledon, and you can
see here's the epidermis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the epidermis, there are these
stomata, which are stained dark blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: which allow for gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: When ATML1 is overexpressed in all cell
layers, you start to get stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: developing in the internal mesophyll
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really toxic to the plant,
and these guys die, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, dead or dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question we have is, since ATML1
is expressed in every cell in the sepal
[SPEAKER_01]: epidermis, how is it that it only
specifies some of them to become giant
[SPEAKER_01]: cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know from the ATML1 single
mutant, it still has an epidermis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yet it's completely lacking these
giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a question that fascinated
Heather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we have to ask is,
what happens if we overexpress ATML1 just
[SPEAKER_01]: in the epidermis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not overexpressing it in the
inner cell layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not talking lethality here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get this spectacular phenotype,
and this is in collaboration with Rita
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanvento and Gwyneth Ingram.
[SPEAKER_01]: These sepals are completely covered in
giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just overexpressing ATML1 in the
epidermis, just increasing the levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: is sufficient to make sepals with all
giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tells us that levels of ATML1 are
really important in this patterning
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Heather explored this further and asked
the question, how do different genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of ATML1 influence the number of
giant cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just showing you the ATML1
overexpression makes sepals with all giant
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we reduce the level of ATML1 by making
the transgene heterozygous, we find still
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of giant cells, but now a few cells
escape and become small cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reducing ATML1 reduces the number of
giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take this a step further by
removing the endogenous ATML1 by crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: this into the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see that in that case,
we still have ectopic giant cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: but even fewer of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final test is, if we look at a
heterozygous mutant that should have less
[SPEAKER_01]: ATML1 than wild type, we should get fewer
giant cells, and that's exactly what we
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a beautiful dosage dependency
of the number of giant cells on the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic level of ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we wanted to verify this not just
with imaging, but with another mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Heather did flow cytometry to look at
the endoraduplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, giant cells are highly
endoraduplicated, so we're only looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the highly endoraduplicated cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see a very nice gradation in the
number of 16C giant cells on these lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the overexpression homozygous has a
lot, and it goes down to the mutant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has very, very few.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's even more remarkable is that the
overexpression line actually increases
[SPEAKER_01]: endoraduplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start to see 64C cells with an extra
endocycle that we don't see in wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly the dosage of ATML1 is really
important for controlling the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: giant cells in the sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this raises a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In wild type, where we've got some cells
becoming giant and some cells not becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: giant, they all have the same dosage of
ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wild type plants, they've got two
copies of the ATML1 gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple possibilities here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either the cells exhibit varying responses
to the same ATML1 concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: or ATML1 concentrations vary between
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now to test these two possibilities,
Heather generated an ATML1 fluorescent
[SPEAKER_01]: fusion protein reporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's got the whole upstream promoter
region, she's got the m-citrine
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent protein fused to ATML1,
and the downstream 3' UTR region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she transformed this into ATML1 mutant
plants and selected lines where it rescues
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild type number of giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important because this
tells us that this transgene is
[SPEAKER_01]: functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ATML1 here is the only ATML1 that's
making the giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also tells us that this ATML1 is
expressed at the right level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we see is going to accurately
reflect producing the wild type number of
[SPEAKER_01]: giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what do we see in this line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we see that different cells have
different concentrations of ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the ATML1 fluorescent fusion
protein reporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nuclear localized because it's a
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're seeing here, all these dots
are different nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that some have very high
concentrations of ATML1, very bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And its neighbor is a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here there's a really bright one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one that's so dim you can barely
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely different
concentrations of ATML1 in these different
[SPEAKER_01]: epidermal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a point at which giant cells,
this is before giant cells have been
[SPEAKER_01]: established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is before the specification has
taken place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does one cell get higher levels of
ATML1 expression than its neighbor?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this made us think about the fact that
gene expression is stochastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of studies showing that
gene expression fluctuates up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hypothesized that maybe ATML1
concentrations fluctuate in each cell
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe this is the patterning
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if ATML1 is fluctuating up and down,
if it passes a threshold, maybe that cell
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on to become a giant cell,
whereas another cell that never crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: that threshold goes on to become a small
cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fits with our genetic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we increase the expression of ATML1,
we're going to bump all this fluctuation
[SPEAKER_01]: up above the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now everything's going to become a
giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ATML1 mutant, now everything's
below the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing's going to become a giant cell
because there's no ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so now we need to test this by live
imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Heather live imaged these ATML1
reporters every eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the movie showing you the
development over eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every eight hours, over many hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we collaborated with Henrik Janssen,
James Locke, and their post-docs Jose
[SPEAKER_01]: Telles and Pau Formosa Jordan at the
Sainsbury Laboratory at University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cambridge to quantify ATML1 in each cell
over time and to create a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Heather actually flew over to Cambridge
and worked with Jose on developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: quantification pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a real tour de force.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take the raw image.
[SPEAKER_01]: They segment every single nucleus,
which means detect each one individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take different time points and align
them using Alt and then contract the cell
[SPEAKER_01]: lineages over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the 16-hour time point in red
and the 24-hour time point in green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the nucleus is yellow, that means
that it's the same nucleus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's divided, then they track which
one's descended from which.
[SPEAKER_01]: And measure the ATML1 concentration in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put all this data together so
that we can track individual nuclei how
[SPEAKER_01]: their ATML1 concentration fluctuates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we have two predictions to be
tested from the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that before a cell becomes
giant, ATML1 levels should be above the
threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second is that if a cell is going
to remain small, then ATML1 levels should
[SPEAKER_01]: not surpass the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the key here is that this should all
happen before the fate is decided so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's predictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so here's what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all the cells in the sepal
epidermis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giant cells are in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small cells are in blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see, first of all, that it does
fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hypothesis is less clear, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that, in general, the giant
cells tend to reach high levels of ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's ATML1 concentration,
high levels, over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the blue cells actually reach
very, very high concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some small cells are getting way up
here in the concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then Heather thought about this a
little bit more and asked, is there any
[SPEAKER_01]: cell cycle dependence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because end reduplication decision is
probably made during G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she determined the cell cycle by
looking at the nuclear area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a cell that goes through G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's large.
[SPEAKER_01]: It divides.
[SPEAKER_01]: G1 nuclei are smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the graph showing a nuclear area
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's large in G2, divides to smaller
nuclei.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use the nuclear area to
determine the stage of the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throughout, I'm going to show you G2
in light blue and G1 in yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look at a couple cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we've got a cell that starts out in
G1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got very high concentration of ATML1
in G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes on to end reduplicate and
becomes a giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plot this on the graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we derive a threshold for ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that this cell crosses the
threshold and then becomes a giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's another cell that has lower
concentrations of ATML1 during G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never quite makes it past the
threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it divides and goes on to become two
small cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another cell that is above the
threshold in G1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also above the threshold in G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes on to end reduplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this cell crosses the threshold in
G1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't have any effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: In G2, it's below the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes on and divides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing a clear cell cycle
dependence.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cells in G2 and the ATML1 crosses
the threshold, then it becomes a giant
cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to quantify this using
receiver operator characteristic and find
[SPEAKER_01]: the threshold this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at all the cells in G1 and
we take the peak ATML1 concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: before it makes a decision, so the top
one, we can plot it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see we've got fairly overlapping
distributions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do look at the true positives
versus the false positives, it basically
[SPEAKER_01]: follows the range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a random line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get a 54% predictivity,
which basically means we have no
[SPEAKER_01]: predictivity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not predictive in G1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if we look at G2 phase,
so we've got, again, the peak ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that now this distributes
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The giant cells tend to have a higher peak
ATML1 than the small cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we plot true positives versus false
positives, then we get 82% predictivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this one is predictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So G2 phase, ATML1 concentration in G2
phase is predictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, we've got the ATML1
concentration in G1 phase doesn't tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in G2 phase, if ATML1 is low,
it's going to go through mitosis and
[SPEAKER_01]: divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if it's high, it's going to go on
and reduplicate and become a giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put this into a model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is developed by Pao Formosa Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ATML1, in every single cell,
we've got ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a concentration that changes in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on production, there's a production
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Degradation, degradation term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a positive feedback loop that we
hypothesize because ATML1 has its own
[SPEAKER_01]: binding site in its promoter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out in the model,
it can work whether we have or do not have
[SPEAKER_01]: this positive feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put stochastic noise into
every single part of this equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is a little bit random.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we think that ATML1 must
control some downstream target gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: given that it's a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be activating something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that downstream target gene is going
to regulate the cell cycle only in G2
[SPEAKER_01]: phase to promote endoraduplication and
inhibit mitosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got this cell cycle timer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just oscillating up and down to
give us cell cycle time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the behavior of ATML1 versus the
target is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it produces a soft threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the target has to cross a threshold
during G2 to make a cell endoraduplicate
[SPEAKER_01]: and become giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It generally follows ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of stochasticity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes ATML1 will cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got ATML1 concentration target.
[SPEAKER_01]: If ATML1 crosses its threshold,
but the target does not, then the cell is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to divide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if the target crushes the
threshold, but ATML1 does not,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the cell is going to endoraduplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might explain this 82% prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got soft threshold here.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so how does the model look?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it looks very much like the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got ATML1 concentrations
fluctuating up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they surpass a threshold in G2,
then the cell goes on to endoraduplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if the cell does not pass the
threshold in G2, it's going to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: dividing and dividing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it passes the threshold in G1,
it keeps dividing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got ATML1 fluctuating up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the target fluctuating up and
down following ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just doing the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we've got the cell size pattern
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the ploidy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the 2C is in yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 4C is in blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it endoraduplicates, it becomes
red, and then purple, then green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's play that movie again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can watch the ploidy and see that
the cells are going to 4C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're dividing, going back to 2C.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then sometimes they decide to
endoraduplicate and become red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those cells endoraduplicate
further and become giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the model is developing a pattern of
giant cells interspersed between smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can the model reproduce our beautiful
dosage series?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just varied the ATML1 production
rate, we can get the whole range of
[SPEAKER_01]: different numbers of giant cells from all
giant cells down to a few giant cells like
[SPEAKER_01]: wild type down to no giant cells in the
mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in conclusion, we've really discovered
a new patterning mechanism based on
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuations of a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATML1 fluctuates up and down in the cephal
primordium cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the high state during G2,
it promotes endoraduplication and causes
[SPEAKER_01]: the formation of a giant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if it's low throughout G2,
then the cell divides and becomes a small
[SPEAKER_01]: cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really fascinating because
modeling has long predicted that there
[SPEAKER_01]: should be slight fluctuations of the
activators of sulfate to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: patterning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's a regular pattern,
they need to be initiated by very small
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a model based on the formation
of trichomes, or hair cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got the activators very
slightly fluctuating randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sets up the regular pattern of
trichome spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are now seeing very much amplified
fluctuations that are doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: patterning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the work of Heather,
as I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she just defended her PhD in the
papers in revision for eLife.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this is not the end of the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of future questions,
which are, what genes does ATML1 regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce giant cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do these genes respond to
different concentrations of ATML1 to enact
[SPEAKER_01]: the threshold?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about the others?
[SPEAKER_01]: What other epidermal specification genes
we found involved in giant cell
[SPEAKER_01]: development?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they upstream, downstream,
or possibly in a feedback loop?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lila Luna just joined the lab,
and she's working on these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is work funded by a five-year NSF
career grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also looking at LEGO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned LEGO in the very beginning
as one of the other mutants that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any giant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEGO encodes a cell cycle regulator that's
involved in inhibiting cyclin-CDK
[SPEAKER_01]: complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it promotes endoraduplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question is, does LEGO follow
the predictions in the model for the
[SPEAKER_01]: target?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dana is working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One prediction is that LEGO should be
dosage dependent, like ATML1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what Dana sees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get the gradation from all
giant cells to no giant cells by
[SPEAKER_01]: modulating the genetic dosage of LEGO.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to come back to the question of
organ size here and ask, how does cell
[SPEAKER_01]: size affect organ size?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was our original hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you can see, the number of giant
cells has absolutely no effect on organ
[SPEAKER_01]: size whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go from very few very large
cells to many small cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sepal, so here's sepal area and
here's the different genotypes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all basically exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the work of Dana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this brings up the mystery of
compensation, which is well known in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When some perturbation happens and there's
fewer cells, they increase their size to
[SPEAKER_01]: get nearly normal organ size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if there's more cells,
they decrease their size to get nearly
[SPEAKER_01]: normal organ size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, organ size is much more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've seen is that the way this
happens is in part because growth does not
[SPEAKER_01]: depend on cell division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gerardo and Heather published a very
nice paper in plant physiology where they
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzed the growth of sepal cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's a single cell lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grows like this over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each cell division event is marked
with an orange arrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that cell division has
absolutely no effect on the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at all the cells in the sepal
and look at, OK, the red is all the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple is the non-dividing and
reduplicating cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And green is the dividing cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their growth curves are essentially
exactly identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter if a cell is dividing
or end reduplicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you get this trade-off
where end reduplication versus division
[SPEAKER_01]: does not affect sepal area.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we have completely not answered the
question of sepal size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we need to look at how do variable
cells promote these uniform organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is the project worked on
by my postdoc, Dr. Leland Hong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a question that fascinated an
international interdisciplinary team.
[SPEAKER_01]: A team of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a Human Frontiers grant to fund
this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're the biologists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we work together with Oreski Boudoud,
Olivia Hamant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Olivia is a cell biologist, and Oreski is
a physicist in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with Richard Smith, who I
mentioned before, who created the
[SPEAKER_01]: morphographic software in Cologne in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chun-Biu Lee and Tamiki Komotsuzaki in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are all in Germany drinking five
liters of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made it through more than one of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, this is funded by Human
Frontiers program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question that fascinated us is the
same question we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go from cellular variability to
organ regularity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as geneticists, if we want to know
what controls the process, we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to find a mutant that disrupts
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to know what creates
regular organs, we need to find mutants
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have regular organs,
that have variable organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we screen for mutants with variable
sepal size in the same flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really novel screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has done this before, screening for
variable organ size in either plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have screened for bigger or
smaller, but never variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the first screens to
actually look for variability at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a few previous screens in
yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leland found this spectacular mutant
called FTSH4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And FTSH4 completely nails variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got everything going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our wild type flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got its four same size sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's three different FTSH4 flowers from
the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is perfectly normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one has one normal sepal here and a
couple smaller sepals here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it also affects the other
floral organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this flower has all four smaller
sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at earlier stages, where the
sepals in wild type close the flower bud
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're all the same size,
we can see, again, there's some normal
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some flowers that are open
because it's got smaller sepals,
[SPEAKER_01]: some normal sepals and some smaller
sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland quantified this to verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got sepal area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wild type has a very small variability
in sepal area, whereas FTSH4 mutants have
[SPEAKER_01]: a much larger variability in sepal area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next question is, when does the
defect arise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a problem in growth or is this a
problem in initiation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland looked at very early sepal
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sepals arise as primordium,
the flanks of the floral meristem here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the four sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rapidly grow and start to cover the
floral meristem and they completely cover
[SPEAKER_01]: it and enclose the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in FTSH4, the sepal primordia arise
normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start to grow normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's when they're trying to close the
flower that you start to see problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower's not quite closing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sepal's lagging behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not catching up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sepal's lagging behind and leaving a
gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, another gap is forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problem is not in the initiation
but in the growth of the sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to think about this from a
modeling perspective and ask the question,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how does cellular variability
give rise to organ regularity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to think about what we should
look at here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started with some modeling and
we based the modeling on our atomic force
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopy data looking at variability in
cell wall stiffness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Reske and Mattel made a model where
they've got a mechanical sheet of tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: and they put different stiffnesses into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So black is stiff and gray to white is
soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they replicate this variability based
on the atomic force microscopy data and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh oh, we got a nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely not a sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we run this model again and again
from different starting conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: we never get a sepal out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might get a drosophila wing or like a
wing disc or something, but we never get a
[SPEAKER_01]: sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly, this model that has
variability in space does not produce
[SPEAKER_01]: regular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we thought, what if we make
variability in space and in time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea here is that each element is
changing its stiffness in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that sometimes it's soft,
sometimes it's stiff, and that's producing
[SPEAKER_01]: very regular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we run it again and again, we get lots
of regular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So variability in space and in time leads
to regular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these are pretty extreme models.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't represent wild type or
mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are extremes, but they give us an
idea what to think about and what to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for in the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this virtual sepal, we see that
cellular variability in space plus
[SPEAKER_01]: cellular variability in time gives us
regular organ morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, is that what happens
in the real sepal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland did live imaging where she's
watching the sepal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's got a plasma membrane marker so
she can track every cell in its growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the mutant, the FDSH4 mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it's having its typical
problem where the sepals aren't closing
[SPEAKER_01]: because the growth isn't quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if she uses morphographics to
analyze the growth in every cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've got a heat map here with red
fast growth and blue slow growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see in wild type there's
considerable variability in growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the mutant, it looks also fairly
variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took a very close look at the
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first we know we need to analyze the
variability in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we take each cell and look at all
of its neighbors and assess how variable
[SPEAKER_01]: is this cell relative to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How variable are neighboring cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do that throughout the sepal and we
get an average variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got wild type plotted in blue
here, mutant plotted in pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so going from low variability to high
variability over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is actually wild type is
more variable than the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now initially without the modeling,
this would be a huge surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is more variability giving rise to
more regular organs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And less variability gives more screwed up
organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here's the average wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely above the average mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we know we need to look at
variability in time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next part of the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at a cell and how much does its
growth rate change at the next time point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one changes a lot and this one
changes very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see that the wild type and
mutant are largely overlapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's high variability to low
variability on the y-axis and time on the
[SPEAKER_01]: x-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the blue wild type
and the pink mutant are maybe the mutant's
[SPEAKER_01]: a little less variable but they're
overlapping enough that we'll call it
[SPEAKER_01]: even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally we looked at variability in cell
wall mechanics, cell wall stiffness using
[SPEAKER_01]: atomic force microscopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking at how does each spot
relate to its neighboring spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: In wild type versus mutant, so we've got
variability here and wild type is more
[SPEAKER_01]: spatially variable than the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again the mutant has reduced
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in wild type we've got high variability
in space, high variability in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it produces regular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the mutant we've got low
variability in space, about the same
[SPEAKER_01]: variability in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is producing irregular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to test this in the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we reduced variability in space,
do we get more irregular sepals like what
[SPEAKER_01]: we see in the mutant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our normal sepals with high
variability in space and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we reduce the variability in space,
and that means making each of these spots
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're seeing here,
bigger spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reduced variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get more irregular sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see these are not as regular,
got slightly different sizes and different
[SPEAKER_01]: shapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is much more like the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just reducing variability in space can
produce more like mutant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we ask how do you go from
cellular variability to regular organ
[SPEAKER_01]: morphology with the cellular variability
in space and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leland looked at the principal
direction of growth, which is the main
[SPEAKER_01]: direction the cell is growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take this green cell and it
grows to be this red cell, it's growing
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly in this direction, so we've got a
little line here indicating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's shown by the white lines here on
each cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over each 24-hour period,
you can see there's quite a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: variability in growth direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a ton of variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's remarkable is if we look over
the whole 48-hour interval at the growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see that now suddenly it's aligning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these growth directions of these
cells over 48 hours have aligned,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that the sepal is growing much more
normally over a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how this happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cell's pointing a little bit to the
right, then it's pointing a little bit to
[SPEAKER_01]: the left, and that averages out to point
with the overall growth of the sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cellular variability is undergoing
spatial temporal averaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a concept from physics that we're
now seeing in biology to produce organ
[SPEAKER_01]: regularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the mutant?
[SPEAKER_01]: The mutant's variable and variable,
but it doesn't do this spatial temporal
[SPEAKER_01]: averaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: After 48 hours, the directions are still
highly variable, and if you go longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still doesn't average.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this cell's growing quite to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still growing a bit to the right,
and at over 48 hours, it's growing a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not averaging properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what causes the failure of spatial
temporal averaging in FDSH4-immunes?
[SPEAKER_01]: We used positional cloning, cloned the
gene, and found, much to our surprise,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a mitochondrial protease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this protease has an ATPase domain,
and a protease domain, and it sits in the
[SPEAKER_01]: inner membrane of the mitochondria,
and it's a bit of a garbage collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's degrading unfolded proteins,
particularly in the ox-phos pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also help proteins fold,
so it's doing both sides of quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really mutates to this variable
organ-sized phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leland pulled out six different alleles in
our screen in this gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: FDSH4 is highly conserved across kingdoms,
so here's the conservation from
[SPEAKER_01]: Arabidopsis to human to yeast to E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, and you can see in the ATPase domain
underlined in red and the protease domain
[SPEAKER_01]: in green that it's highly conserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we go from this FDSH4 mutation
generates mitochondrial defects to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: spatial temporal averaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one possibility is increased
reactive oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitochondrial defects often cause the
accumulation of reactive oxygen species,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly superoxide and hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland stained looking for reactive
oxygen species, and she found greatly
[SPEAKER_01]: increased hydrogen peroxide accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's very darkly stained
compared to wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she also saw superoxide accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's wild type that's got a little
bit, and here's the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it's got very early and very
much increased and fairly variable
[SPEAKER_01]: superoxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sepals are very darkly stained,
while others are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's the reactive oxygen species in
the mutant causing the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we should be able to reproduce the
phenotype by treating plants with hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, in fact, exactly what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Leland dips wild type plants in
hydrogen peroxide, she can get out
[SPEAKER_01]: variable sepal size, particularly smaller
sepals, just like the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, conversely, if it's really the
reactive oxygen species, we should be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to remove reactive oxygen species from the
mutant and rescue it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if she overexpresses catalase,
which degrades hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: she can rescue normal sepal development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just give you a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: These sepals look even larger than wild
type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is ROS doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: ROS affects a whole lot of signal
transduction mechanisms, so it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that it could be doing is
causing cross-linking of the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we looked at stiffness of the cell
wall, and we find that, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mutant cell walls are, in general,
stiffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a heat map again, where we've
got stiff and red and soft and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the mutant is overall
stiffer than wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this makes us ask, do reactive oxygen
species actually regulate wild type sepal
[SPEAKER_01]: development?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I looked at this, I was really
excited because I saw that reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: species were accumulating in the wild type
in a tip-to-base gradient as the sepal
[SPEAKER_01]: matures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that reminded me of the growth
pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in young sepals, they're growing
rapidly throughout, and then they start to
[SPEAKER_01]: slow from the tip, this blue slow growth,
and it descends toward the base,
[SPEAKER_01]: very much reminiscent of this pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can ask, is ROS a mechanism of
maturation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to ask this, what we should see in the
mutant is that the mutant matures early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that it's starting to mature
from the tip, just starting to,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the mutant is blue pretty much
throughout the sepal at these later time
[SPEAKER_01]: points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's maturing early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if ROS is really acting as the signal
terminating growth in wild type,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should increase sepal size if we remove
the ROS in wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take our wild type plants and
overexpress either ascorbate peroxidase or
[SPEAKER_01]: catalase, and we can get larger sepals
just by reducing the reactive oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: species in wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if we overexpress RBOHD,
which is NADPH oxidase, produces too much
[SPEAKER_01]: ROS, then we get smaller sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to conclude, we found that variability
produces regularity, which is really kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a remarkable thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cellular variability undergoing spatial
temporal averaging gives rise to organ
[SPEAKER_01]: regularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reactive oxygen species inhibit spatial
temporal averaging, and they seem to form
[SPEAKER_01]: a major signal inducing the maturation of
the organ and termination of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland published this in a beautiful
paper in Developmental Cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the future, we want to know,
how does ROS affect spatial temporal
[SPEAKER_01]: averaging at a more mechanistic level,
following up on the mechanics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What mechanism produces ROS in wild type
to terminate sepal growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what other genes contribute to sepal
growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Leland's pulled out additional mutants,
the variable organ size mutants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and is following up on a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I particularly want to mention the
variable organ size two mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gene encodes a MIB domain
transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is being worked on by Minyuen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's wild type with its four equal
size sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the mutant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see variable sepal size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting because it is
affecting the primordium formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got defects where the primordium
don't form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, the sepal primordium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's affecting the other end of the
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw FTSH4 is affecting termination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And VOS2 is now affecting initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping we can put this all
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to summarize everything,
we've got our spatial temporal averaging
[SPEAKER_01]: of cellular variability to produce organ
regularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've found a new patterning mechanism
where fluctuations in 18.01 surpass the
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold during G2.
[SPEAKER_01]: That triggers end reduplication via LEGO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads to proper organ curvature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reactive oxygen species inhibit
spatial temporal averaging and induce the
[SPEAKER_01]: maturation and termination of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to mention a few other
collaborations going on with SIPs in
[SPEAKER_01]: future directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Dena's also looking at the
relationship between polyploidy with whole
[SPEAKER_01]: genome duplication and endopolyploidy and
how that relates to cell size and organ
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really an extension of our work
in a new direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in collaboration with Jeff
Doyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joe is a joint graduate student with
Mike Scanlon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's looking at asymmetric division in
the moss apical cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leland's been collaborating with
members of Joss Rose's lab looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics of cuticle ridge formation on the
sepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a paper in revision for
molecular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Leland's also worked with Thomas
Bjorkman looking at ROS in broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks very much like Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's accumulating the same way in the
sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd really like to thank the members of
my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, Leland did the work on
organ size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Heather did the work on 1801
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Xian was my first graduate student and did
the work that I didn't have time to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about in sec 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've told you what Minyuan and Dena
and Joe and Lila are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work's been funded by the NSF and the
Human Frontiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fantastic collaborators,
particularly Henrik Jonsson and James
[SPEAKER_01]: Locke and their post-docs Jose and Pau.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Oreski, Olivier, Richard, and Chumbu
Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to say that this is really
the result of the hard work of my lab and
[SPEAKER_01]: the inspiration of their lab and their
ideas all coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's my lab over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want to thank my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great working with you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look forward to all the future
results we're going to have, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to thank our
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: These collaborations are really intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We meet every two to three weeks on Skype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We email all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys feel like lab members.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're always talking to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even meet in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's in Singapore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been really great
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's allowed us to do things that we
couldn't do just as a lab by ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: because we've got these different
disciplinary perspectives coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to just finish by thanking Plant
Biology and the Weill Institute for being
[SPEAKER_01]: my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last five years, and hopefully the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have taken a small look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we looked at is Sec24 promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at that because we had it
available from our Sec24 work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And HM01 definitely has more differences
between different cells in Sec24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's exactly what the reviewers have
asked us to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've asked us to look at different
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Heather, it is currently growing a
bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think either way it comes out,
it's still interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we've found a fundamental
property that transcription factors are
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuating all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the first part, I'm going to be
showing the mini screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's obviously a pattern in time of
how many cells are entering inward
[SPEAKER_01]: duplication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is changing in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's particularly complicated by the fact
that at the end, we've got still model
[SPEAKER_01]: development happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those cells are not inward duplicating
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start to undergo asymmetric
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a key point is that if
a giant cell forms, a stilano cell cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: form because it takes the cell out of the
patterning process before it can get
[SPEAKER_01]: stilano.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rate does change in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some quantification of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the periodicity of the cell cycle
change for giant cells versus the regular
[SPEAKER_05]: cells?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't actually know the answer to
that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I'd really like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the hypotheses is that
inward duplicating cells may cycle faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is we need a good cell cycle
marker that still cycles in inward
[SPEAKER_01]: duplicating cells the same as in non
inward duplicating cells, divided cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't yet have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we might have a lead on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question is, do other mutants
that have ROS accumulation also lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: this variable phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this actually is a very interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: FTSH4 is particularly variable because the
RS accumulation is also variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've seen is that that leads to
the variability in size in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just ROS accumulation leads to much
more variability in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, when we overexpress the
NADPH oxidase and increase accumulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: ROS, we tend to get equally smaller
sepals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have much more variability in
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the subtlety that I didn't mention in
the model, when we decrease spatial
[SPEAKER_01]: temporal averaging by decreasing
variability, we get more variable shape in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it fits with this spatial temporal
averaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a key role in shape and a
smaller role in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is slightly more complex,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, is it necessary to
have the downstream target also have a
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold?
[SPEAKER_01]: We propose a downstream target because
beta-mol is a transcription factor acting
[SPEAKER_01]: something downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that it's necessary for the
target to have a threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really does give us nice dynamics
that look very much like our data with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soft threshold in 18.01.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really something we're going to
have to test for the future, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: whether LEGO has some kind of harder
threshold like this or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, really, is LEGO the
target or is it something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there many steps between 18.01 and
LEGO or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know genetically LEGO is downstream.
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible that the FTSH4 ROS effect
is actually regulating 18.01 as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I notice that 18.01 has this start doping,
which usually binds cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oxidation of cholesterol is well
characterized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder if we're regulating the
activity of the transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, is ROS regulating
18.01?
[SPEAKER_01]: A very interesting hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, we don't see any obvious defect in
giant cells in the FTSH4.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see a connection in the
patterning there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The start domain is fascinating because,
as you say, in animals, they often will
[SPEAKER_01]: bind cholesterol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what it's actually doing
in plants except that it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been a lot of people trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping they're going to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been a big mystery for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if you think of the ROS signal
as being an intercellular signal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like mosaics between FTSH4 and
wild-type signal, do you actually see the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is ROS an intercellular signal or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's thought is that hydrogen peroxide
can move and superoxide can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also produces very interesting
ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not yet tested that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also seem to be one of our reviewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that we said we were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not trivial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think there is something
interesting going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are each of these different
species moving, and does that contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to things or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big question for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
