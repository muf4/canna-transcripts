[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to go through a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about farmscape ecology, the two way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do farms provide for nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does nature provide for farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting people to the ecology of their
landscape, understanding the people's
[SPEAKER_00]: side, and then very briefly outline a
study that we're thinking of trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I guess, a bit low for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work at Hawthorne Valley Farm,
which is in Columbia County, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York County, which is basically the
border with Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a biodynamic farm about two hours
north of New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our regular staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the center of operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of us kind of come along
for the ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to give you a little bit idea who
we are so that you can understand what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can or can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a botanist, a plant ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anna is actually an anthropologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she works with us with the people part
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle, who's here but in the insect
collection today, is our technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's been working a lot with ants and
the patterns in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our son is really into dragonflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's a lot faster, has a lot better
eyes than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our dog is always with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I tend to shuffle paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can, which makes me more happy,
I'm actually a wildlife ecologist,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Emily said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawthorne Valley Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into a whole lot of
detail about what biodynamic farming is,
[SPEAKER_00]: partially because I'm not all that
experienced in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of why it's relevant or works
with us, a form of organic farming that
[SPEAKER_00]: views the farm as an individuality,
closely tied to its social and ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: surroundings, and ideally largely
self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of its nutrient flows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of that philosophy is,
what I'd say, ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we fit into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to connect with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of our work is connecting with
the community, the people in the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which fits into this philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do as a program, the Farmscape
Ecology Program, is try to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: informed compassion for our local working
landscape, its people, and other life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with research and we work with
outreach to try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really trying to get enthusiasm,
trying to help people be curious about
[SPEAKER_00]: their landscape and help inform them at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do try to do original research,
but we're not in an academic setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our audience is not really our
scientific peers, but it's the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the county, the farmers we interact with,
the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that affects how we do our work,
for better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the heart of what we try
to do, Farmscape Ecology, I think we try
[SPEAKER_00]: to think about it in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to think about what can farming
potentially provide to nature conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: in our landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking, I don't know the global
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the reverse, what can nature
potentially do for farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you tend to have a tendency to look at
a landscape like this either as being
[SPEAKER_00]: production, the pasture, the gardens,
the pasture, et cetera, or from the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective of nature conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, it's really a combined
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we try to emphasize,
both in our research and as we interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that all go together?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we found helpful in
trying to communicate with farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: other people about what can farming
provide to nature is an idea that builds
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what Hawthorne Valley could
be any place, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looked like, say, in the year 1400,
lots of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might have been some native
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were probably a lot more beaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hillside probably burned,
not every year, but regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: May have looked something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had certain organisms existing in
that landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that landscape evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had, this is maybe what it looked
like in 1870, same landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same section.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on aerial photographs and other
historical evidence, this is sort of what
[SPEAKER_00]: it looked like in its most open state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today, and that would be what the
landscape looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today, I'm jumping ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had various organisms existing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today, it looks more like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question becomes, this is
today's landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got more roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forest has come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have some fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our question is, OK, those native
organisms that existed in this landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: or perhaps in this landscape, where do
they find space in today's landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we try to think of that
are through analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I imagine this is probably actually a
simile, but I'll say it's an analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we try to think of ecological
analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we mean by an ecological analogy
is it refers to a human-shaped habitat
[SPEAKER_00]: which, while not the ones that the given
organism co-evolved with, offer enough
[SPEAKER_00]: similarities or analogies to be
ecologically functional for that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example is, this is what a forest
looks like after it has burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this brush coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a lightly grazed pasture
that also has a lot of brush in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to claim it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain species that
occurred here for which this analogy
[SPEAKER_00]: works.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beaver pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cow pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certainly things in here that
are not in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, some of the dragonflies
that like these edges that are like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be there and they'll be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say this works as an analogy just
for those species of dragonflies for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to come back to that question,
where do they find a home, the answer is,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, where do they find workable
analogies?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what our challenge is, how can
farming encourage such analogies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we do is try to work with
farmers to help them understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: history and the ecology of their landscape
from the perspective of understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: story and those analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some work we did for Roxbury
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you know Roxbury Farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could be at a seminar today
where you actually hear Jean-Paul from
[SPEAKER_00]: Roxbury talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you came here, you're not going to
hear him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do ecological maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we try to think of each of these
habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to imagine what might the
analogies be and how could those be
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another map.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Hawthorne Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A habitat map for a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then don't worry about the small
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the type of information that
we would give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have that habitat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for each of those habitats,
we talk about location, nature
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation value, how it might interact
with agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suggestions for management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the farmers know a lot better than
we know how that land should be farmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sharing our ideas for better or
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this camera on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I keep feeling like I must be
getting my ear filmed or something as I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: standing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to run through some of
these habitats so that you get a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of an idea of how we're thinking about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mature hay fields were the ecological
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the species of conservation
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for some species, the analogy might
be between prairies and hay fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this works as a structural analogy
for these grassland nesting birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's a fairly common
example that's brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our county, this is the trajectory
of open area in our county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those birds have certainly gone through
a real decline in habitat availability
[SPEAKER_00]: since the 1880s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was not all that much to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you bring into the
question when you're thinking about those
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, what makes that work as a
habitat for grassland birds is,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, when does haying happen relative to
when the young birds get out of the nest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're haying it before the birds
are out of the nest, then it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: as an analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just some historical work we
did looking at date of haying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, that's the black space behind this
versus various historical data we have
[SPEAKER_00]: from the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point is, haying is occurring
earlier in general than it occurred
[SPEAKER_00]: historically, which makes that analogy
less viable for some of the grassland
[SPEAKER_00]: birds because they fledge sort of in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if most of the haying, for example,
the shakers were doing most of their
[SPEAKER_00]: haying after the middle of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beginning of July, whereas today,
a lot of it's happening before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it more difficult for those
birds to get their young off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important when you think about
analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not reconstructing prairie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That analogy doesn't work for butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it doesn't work for
butterflies is they're much more
[SPEAKER_00]: botanically picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caterpillars of butterflies need to
find like a monarch, goes out after the
[SPEAKER_00]: milkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to find the particular plants
they're looking for, which aren't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a hay field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same analogy doesn't work so well for
butterflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old fields and poor meadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another habitat you find on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the analogy is we do have grasslands
in our area that are hilltop, rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: grasslands, some native grasses up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were organisms historically that
survived there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of those actually come down
into these old fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work that my wife did looking
at the botanical diversity of pastures,
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive pastures, drier hill pastures,
showing that there are more species in
[SPEAKER_00]: these dry hillsides, plus more of them are
native.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a place where you're going to have
conservation of native plant species,
[SPEAKER_00]: these dry hillsides are quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In part, perhaps, because there were
sources in the landscape that had species
[SPEAKER_00]: already adapted to those kinds of
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing is it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like butterflies, so you got to bear
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work for these butterflies because
you do have those native plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their caterpillars can feed on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the analogy works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shrubby fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked, this slide should still be
familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one with the burn over and the
post cow shrubland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the analogies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have, who do you find there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how many of you know the Eastern,
sorry, the New England cottontail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The New England cottontail is actually
being considered for endangered species
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sylvalagus, so it's the same species
as the Eastern cottontail, but it's one
[SPEAKER_00]: that has essentially used to be the only
cottontail east of the Hudson,
[SPEAKER_00]: a shrubland species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's declined dramatically, and one of the
areas are these shrublands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the species you could
potentially find in such an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shrubland birds are also important,
and many of them have been declining
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just giving you a quick kind of
rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the details,
but just give me a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: overview for what some of these different
habitats might offer, potentially can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other habitats that we've been
looking at is the old farm woodlot and its
[SPEAKER_00]: role as being actually an ancient farm,
as ancient forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about ancient,
I mean forest that has long been in
[SPEAKER_00]: forest, although extensive logging or
other uses may have occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is a primary forest is
obviously one that's sort of basically
[SPEAKER_00]: never been, almost never been touched,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas an ancient forest, the idea is
it's been in forest for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: although many of those trees may not be
particularly old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a primary forest is ancient,
but not all ancient forests are primary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the interesting thing when you look at
the history of the landscape, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the earliest aerial photographs we
have for our region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see lots of farmland, but you see some
of these areas that were left in forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: partially because they're rocky,
but partially because all farms needed a
[SPEAKER_00]: woodlot for building barns, for wood,
for that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now today, yeah, it just all looks like
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, forests like this have some
special things because they were never
[SPEAKER_00]: taken out of forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, never in the past 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working in a farmland setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another habitat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dark areas here are plots that
we've realized were probably some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways we did that, we were doing
soil samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were looking at the depth of the
organic layer, because when you plow
[SPEAKER_00]: something, that gets all mixed up,
and you don't have that deep organic
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use soils to help us find which
areas are ancient forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go into an ancient forest
like this, you find a variety of old
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, old shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, none of these are particularly big
trees because logging has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil conditions are such that you
get something like rattlesnake plantain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know rattlesnake plantain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that sounds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife's the botanist, so I'll take your
word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could well be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an orchid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost never saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, we were walking
through these old forests, these ancient
[SPEAKER_00]: forests plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some special things going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some studies with floodplain
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the forests along creeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at ancient versus not
ancient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you find, we categorized those
forests into different forest types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, we were comparing
cover by invasive shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that, indeed, the more recent
forests, not surprising, are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the highest amount of invasive shrubs
in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the older ones, one of the
interesting things to think about is,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say floodplain forests,
can you picture this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the areas along the streams that
regularly, maybe once or twice a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: get flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really disturbed areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if all that forest is taken off,
then you have this great inoculation of
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species coming down the creek and
going in and being able to set up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, in the past 50 years, you cleaned
it up completely, then you have this big
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's been in forest, then those
invasive species are much less able to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you also see a higher
diversity of native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go into that too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have meadows and ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a wet meadow on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a farm pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analogy, as we mentioned before,
might be a beaver pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting things to think
about is that beaver have this huge impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ecology of our landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were a lot of beaver like in the
1500s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this is is an estimate of the
amount of pond surface area in Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: County versus year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that there was
probably a huge drop off in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: pond because the beaver were all trapped
out for fur around 1600, 1700.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you started to get mill ponds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just now, with all this, I don't know
if you have it here or not, do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion for ponds in this area,
new houses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of what this accounts for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is they're not the same
ecologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some work with ponds,
both on farms and off farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an index.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at various animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an index of overall
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the surrounding land use,
agricultural, residential, mixed,
[SPEAKER_00]: or neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was about 95 ponds that we looked
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that the agricultural
ponds actually were more diverse than the
[SPEAKER_00]: residential ponds, which you might,
if you think about the typical residential
[SPEAKER_00]: pond, you know you might understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of them, or many of them,
are mowed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to keep them crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what life wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these, now these aren't
loafing ponds in the middle of a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these might be ponds in grazed areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are much more loosely managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're more diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another analogy might be vernal pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually do find some of these
vernal pool amphibians in those farm ponds
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have a lot of fish in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet meadows, again, are quite diverse
areas, have quite a few native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, probably a lot of native species,
relatively speaking, because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the natural landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some pretty flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wet meadow flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful flower, if you know
this, cardinal flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, got to bring in some
butterflies, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: butterflies, the bronze copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Baltimore checkerspot with its food
plant, turtle head.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what does nature provide to farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some of you who know much
more about this than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have started to try to look at it
in part because as we were working with
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, that's very much a question
that's important to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're interested in ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, what can it do for them in
production-wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an either or, but it's how do
you also respect their perspective and
[SPEAKER_00]: help them try to understand this aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have questions about that
part that I just went through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are actually still awake,
so that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, ecological services.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel a little bit hesitant saying
services because it's kind of like saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that my wife gives me marital services or
something like that, or that I give her
[SPEAKER_00]: husband services, in the sense that I
think there's more to it than just the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitty gritty of the monetary effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, bees are one of the very
often talked about providers of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these ecological services.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was some work we did, actually a
student working with us, very basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different kinds of insects
that come and fertilize on some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes, honeybee, but maybe it's only
about a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these other ones, many of these,
are native species that are providing
[SPEAKER_00]: those pollination services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was, again, that generality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was looking at different crops and a
number of native bee visits for some
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, like cucumbers, mainly honeybees
were pollinating those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then for some other ones, like the
wild flowers would make sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe like broccoli rabe or up here,
the raspberries, they were getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated by the wild bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this builds into our consideration of
landscape because of something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is not our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Rufus Isaacs at Michigan
State University looking at bees that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, this is the blueberry
flowering period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the flight periods of the
different pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question that this poses is,
OK, great, you provide them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry crop, but how are they staying
alive the rest of the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to provide something for them
out here if you want to have those native
[SPEAKER_00]: species around pollinating your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a little bit related to that,
going back to that floodplain study I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any of you been in a floodplain early
in the spring, say in May?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wild flowers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know like bloodroot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen bloodroot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's some other one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trout lily?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely trout lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue cohosh, maybe something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's before the trees leaf out,
you have this big burst of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great place for bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we looked at was the bees on a
farm and an adjacent floodplain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was that about a quarter
of those species here were ones we found
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spring on the floodplain and then
later in the year in the farm fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just starts to give you this picture
of how the landscape is supporting what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in those crop fields,
some of those surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another way of looking at
some of these, the amount of flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: around a vegetable garden and the amount
of bees we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not surprisingly, more flowers,
more bees, except I didn't show you this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that screws up the
statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This observation up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was interesting was when we went
back and looked at that, that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 19 different farms in the
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: This farm was the sandiest farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that explain the result?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground nesting bees, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have bees really like to be able
to, some of these individual bees nest in
[SPEAKER_00]: sandy areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have sandy soil, it's just a
much better habitat for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it adds, yes, flowers and food sources
are important, but as well recognized,
[SPEAKER_00]: nesting sources are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just, how many of you,
have you ever seen jumping spiders?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, they're fun spiders
because they're the spiders that look at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hold them in your hand and they
follow you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an orb weaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know these ones, the big
argyre piece that you see in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a crab spider waiting for somebody,
some unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look up, I forgot the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be an amurubid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we did a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our tropical fish slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually an aerial view of
Hawthorne Valley Farm main gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where the crops are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little bit of a historical
picture now because they've changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangement of the farm and not so much of
the area where this is in crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are surrounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a riparian area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wetlands here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we just followed the
insects, both in the center part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and also in the surroundings,
or insects and spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit, this was an initial work,
just to try to understand how does that
[SPEAKER_00]: change?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the flow of these invertebrates
over the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the example here I'm going to show you
is spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white areas, we couldn't study all of
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have the person power.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the darker the green, the more
abundant were the spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just going to go through the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is May.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's June, July, July, September,
and then September, October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pattern, I think, which is sort of
summarized here, is that early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, the wilder areas and the drive
strips, which are the uncultivated areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: they tended to have the most spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas by the end of the year,
the crops and the crop edges had the most
[SPEAKER_00]: spiders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to know this better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little bit of a just so
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can picture that there's a flow
going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps the spiders earlier in the year
coming into these more central crop areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasps are another important provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the tomato worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well parasitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the wasps do to tomato
hornworm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're actually a control of the
tomato hornworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not this wasp in particular, but another
much smaller wasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was just the relationship between
the amount of forest at each of these 19
[SPEAKER_00]: different farms and the amount of,
in this case, wingless wasps that we found
[SPEAKER_00]: in our trapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a significant relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more the forest you have, the more of
these wingless wasps you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very gross information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to look at it in more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But suggestive of a relationship between
the landscape and the amount of these
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my other family.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have a chance to work with insects,
this is what I work with a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ground beetles, the crabbids.
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting group, some of which are,
I have to confess, summer pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of them, hopefully the majority
of them, are actually beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be both pest predators and weed
seed predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just start to look at the patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these communities of beetles
distributed on the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a study we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the beetles that we found in
the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we were just looking at
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the surrounding grassy areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just ask the question, how are these
communities related?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at veggies, grassland,
and woods, is it all essentially one
[SPEAKER_00]: beetle community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it something like this, where
they're each completely distinct beetle
[SPEAKER_00]: communities?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as most ecological answers
are, the answer is sort of, or kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: or somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, we ended up with data like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are different ground beetle species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of captures in the
cultivated edge areas in the wild are
[SPEAKER_00]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are basically only in the
cultivated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them spread out more widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go further with this, you'd have to
understand which of these are really most
[SPEAKER_00]: important in terms of those
agro-ecological services.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's just trying to look at the
patterns of life on the landscape relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to the services they might provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to ask, OK, if we look at these
three areas, we look at the veggies,
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at the woods, we look at the
surrounding grassland, what are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that are most related to each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just looked at correlations.
[SPEAKER_00]: How closely correlated is the abundance of
ants, spiders, and ground beetles in
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies versus ants, spiders, and ground
beetles in woodlands?
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the higher the value,
the more closely correlated the two
[SPEAKER_00]: communities were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grass and wood, more than a third of
the cases were significantly correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than a third of the different insect
groups we looked at, whereas woods and
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies were not so closely correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so diagrammatically, that's
represented by woods and grassland,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite similar in community or relatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grassland and veggie, somewhat veggie and
woodland, not quite so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This I just put up there in case our
technician came.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking at ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kyle, the technician I showed you,
has been looking at ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the same sort of thing,
but for different ant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into ants, I can show you that
slide in more detail later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to understand, this is some of
the work that Emily did, not this in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, but this whole theme of soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how has the landscape changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How has soil life changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that affect what can happen
today on the landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some historical data on organic
matter in cropland hay pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forest in New York state, I couldn't
find something specifically for our
[SPEAKER_00]: county.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from our county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not be a completely valid
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the forest value is around seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is the amount of
organic matter here versus apparently how
[SPEAKER_00]: much it has decreased over that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What effect has that had on soil life?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the answer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of our attempts to look at
it, and it's just all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even try to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily did some work on the Hawthorne
Valley Farm, where she looked at fields
[SPEAKER_00]: that had been in haying, pasture,
and veggies over quite a few, at least 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had actually individual data on how
much was coming in and out of those
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: What effect did that have on the soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: We did grow outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to Emily about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a somewhat messy picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although interestingly, when you grew
soils, when you grew plants, in these
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, it seems like the actual height of
the plant did correspond to what you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: predict very roughly from our budgets of
nutrients in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily is nodding reassuringly that I'm not
talking complete nonsense when I'm up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to look at, ecological
services that people don't always think
[SPEAKER_00]: about, is these are some of the pastures
at Hawthorne Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a grazier, you'll look at
this and say, oh my god, they're grazing
[SPEAKER_00]: on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't sheep, they're cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that people have started to
look at is actually the role of,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me just go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role of fields like this in
self-medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, cows have been shown to
self-medicate to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means they go out and they find
different plants in their landscape that
[SPEAKER_00]: might help them if they've got a high
parasite load.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a milk effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might be another service that the
botanical diversity is providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Want to get to butterflies again?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously how these different
habitats are arranged around the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also what you do on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wildflower strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this farm happened to be surrounded by
wetland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this amazing diversity of
actually fairly rare wetland butterflies
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in and nectaring here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a nice combination of how
this farm was actually interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: its landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on to a little bit other aspects of
our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do work with farmers, but we work a lot
with the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia County is two hours north of New
York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means we have a lot of second
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some towns, more than a third of the
homes are second homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What proportion of homes are second homes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody got an idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, about a third or second homes,
we have people coming up on weekends,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have people coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often coming in with ideas about
how they want to manage the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of our program is how do you sort
of help them slow down and look at where
[SPEAKER_00]: they are without telling them,
this is bad, this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just how do you help them realize a
bit better where they are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little picture I put
together a long time ago, but I still like
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually came out of talking to
somebody who was a post-doc over at
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Resources, who was a designer of
parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, look, if you're going to have
a park and you want people to come,
[SPEAKER_00]: you design it so that the greatest
diversity of people come to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what I call a park of local
knowledge and caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it doesn't exist as a
physical park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is, if you want people to
connect to their landscape, how can you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some people get connected with food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some love history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some love nature appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some want to go through formal schooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some love technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you have to do a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is, as we try to connect
people to the landscape, how can we
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify these different ways that they
can enter that landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our attempt at ecotourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join the craze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a really one that took a bit of
explaining to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was our pond study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why exactly do you want to go out in
the middle of my mucky cow pond with a
[SPEAKER_00]: canoe?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing sediment cores.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we've had nobody take us up on
this offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to communicate the idea of history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people like to be part of a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was one thing that really hit us
that we hadn't been expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in and we gave this ecological
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave this little bit at the
beginning about history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got done with the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody asked ecological questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all fascinated with the history
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to try to do is,
we don't want to forget about the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But help people understand where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sort of say a big sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where history is at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: History is going to keep running.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened in the past?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that affect where we may be
going?
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually happens to be different
animals in Columbia County.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the sheep boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have looked at agricultural
history, it was a big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some really high class
espionage associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually the merino sheep,
the Spanish sheep, were a very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: very valued part of the European wool
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were all these covert actions to
get sheep out of Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this is just agricultural
history in Columbia County over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different types of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's interested in ag history,
I can go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just trying to give you the feel
for what we communicate to people to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them feel like they're part of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also want to help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're interested in ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're interested in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how might that translate into the
communities that they're living in,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they're not farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the percentage of the
Columbia County workforce in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: service and retail, and manufacturing over
about 200 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives people, we're here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a huge service retail component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying you want to go back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it shows you what has happened on the
land and what might conceivably be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do want to talk about land cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amount of forest over time,
the amount of farmland, the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: shrubland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just trying to say, OK,
here's the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how does that translate into the
ecology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work in terms of how we get out and
work with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just some of the ways,
some of the people we've worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have interns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who are part of a natural
history participatory research group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rice farmer from up in Vermont
who just really loves dragonflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes down and spends a couple of days
with us each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just how we reach out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with some of the regional
conservation organizations, many of whom
[SPEAKER_00]: have farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we help them with management plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really neat, if any of you are
into shakers, this is a really fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: story of ecology and culture in New
Lebanon, which I could go into more if
[SPEAKER_00]: people were interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we appear at various events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do nature walks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure we did do some
work with students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get them out there on the coldest,
rainiest days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it makes you feel is it
makes you feel old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there I am out there bundled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was somebody in a t-shirt and
shorts, a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, some metabolic change has
happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, and we try to go online.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our soon to be launched,
redesigned web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that trying to think of,
again, it's that park idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never did Facebook until I had that
thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people told us a lot of younger people
do have Facebook pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a group of people we haven't
connected with well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our main projects right
now, the Living Land Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of this is we're putting together
a field guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a landowner, you can go out
and say, OK, what sort of forest do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: in my backyard?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we also want to look at
the cultural aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question becomes, OK, you have this
kind of forest in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do your neighbors perceive that
forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: How might a farmer think of that forest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not trying to say, that's the
right perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wrong perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how do the people around you
perceive of that landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we use this approach to help
people understand not only where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: culturally, but also ecologically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to have another butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big spring salamander,
a beautiful orange tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little orange bright salamander like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hadn't found in the county,
my son said, what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding more orchids around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these sort of pictures are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, who are we communicating
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're communicating with people who like
the pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be more interested in the
pictures than in a graph, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have the graphs to back up our
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how we're going to reach
people is through their heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just a little bit about what
Anna's work has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it already has to do with
connecting people to the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Anna has done a lot of fun work
looking at the food system in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not going to go into this
in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can give you links.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can connect you with Anna.
[SPEAKER_00]: She did a whole project on the Columbia
County food system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because farmers that asked us,
how does this work economically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she did, again, you're not expected
to read the small print unless you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up and try to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CSAs, how do they relate to the
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CSAs in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CSAs up in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do the perceptions that people have
and what they want to get out of it differ
[SPEAKER_00]: based on where they're from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the prices?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do people want to get from their
farmer's market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that kind of a study that helps us
understand how people are using the
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a fun project she did on new
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it's the same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably got quite a few new farms
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Columbia County, that's also the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she interviewed many of these
farmers, put together profiles of each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different farms, and put together this
is a map of, again, Columbia County.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get familiar with this
shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the different new farms
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And partially, again, it gives us an idea
of how people are using the ecology of
[SPEAKER_00]: people on this landscape, I guess you
could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also asked some more specific
questions about their relationships to the
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we try to communicate some of those
ecological maps I was showing you earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, yeah, we can stand up here and tell
or share what we feel is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to understand what the
people, what they feel is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to understand their perspectives
on the landscape can help us share ours
[SPEAKER_00]: more and also help us design our research
so it's most useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part of the living land
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we call the special places
display.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically, there it is again,
Columbia County.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big board where you get to come up
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're at a farmer's market,
you come up to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to, you can put where are
your special places on this map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go to hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go to look for nice views?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go when you want to go
swimming or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, some of this is secret and
people don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is you come out with a map
like this that starts to show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural topography of your landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the places that are really neat
to people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how, again, do you build that interest
into helping them connect with their
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe spreading that interest out,
but also honoring the places that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to visit or feel that are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hardest slide to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the most boring one to look
at too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, these are just sort of the
generalities that I would say we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: at this for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecologically, I think it still continues
to surprise me how much land use history
[SPEAKER_00]: has an effect on what we're seeing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something new, but again,
it's just what personally we learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fine scale patterns of the
unseen world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, to go onto these some
forests and go, like Kyle, who's the ant
[SPEAKER_00]: biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's found an ant that's common in
Columbia County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only other place it's known is
Iowa and Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it not known from New England?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's these sort of mysteries and
patterns that you realize, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: going out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're responding to aspects of the
habitat that we don't see or understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe that agriculture has the
potential, I'm not saying it's automatic,
[SPEAKER_00]: to create important nature conservation
benefits through those analogies we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ebb and flow of farm-relevant life and
the importance of understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is those agricultural services
that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding where are these
creatures coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's affecting how far they travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's affecting the habitats they need
for overwintering or what have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of those commuting strategies
relative to the agroecological services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can we associate biodiversity
actually with benefits in production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big if.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's sort of the core of really making
this relevant for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sociologically, one of the fun things I
had not worked with farmers before,
[SPEAKER_00]: going out and interacting with farmers,
a lot of them are really just keyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't come in in a situation where
you're doing this wrong, this creek is all
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more, let me just show you what's in
your creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids play in the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes wait in the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to know more about the nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the farmers were really
interested in that, although they might
[SPEAKER_00]: not have the time to do much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like to be part of a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find a substitute for
individual interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put together, and this is what
funding agencies want you to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to put together pamphlets to
give to farmers to tell them what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's value in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interacting with the farmers
individually is a much smaller group of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you have a much bigger,
potentially much bigger impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The range of ecological knowledge among
people is alarming and awe-inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you find people that you wouldn't
expect it, and they go, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other places where you go,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, you don't have any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of a realization is always
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ecological humility is a learned
trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things,
as people come up and want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: landscaping, they have this vision of what
they want to do with their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to convince them to take a year
or two to understand where the land is at
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that humility is sometimes
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is just sort of a summary
of how we view what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to build compassion and
stewardship for the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people love the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you love something, you have
curiosity about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask questions, which leads to
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you build knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you know about something,
potentially the more you love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of how we view what we do
as a program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last, very, very last proposed
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is short, so don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still following me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are maps that we did not do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is scenic Hudson recently came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relates to the study we're thinking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently came out with what they call a
food shed conservation study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they looked at is the farms that
sell in New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they located?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Hudson Valley, this is where
those farms are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they prioritized areas based on
where those farms are in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, OK, let's go the next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is production conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not nature conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you take a map like that and
then start to translate it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, how can that farmland production
conservation also have an important nature
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation component?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what role can Hudson Valley farming
play in regional nature conservation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the diversity of landscapes in the
valley, how can farming best support
[SPEAKER_00]: native species?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the sub-region specific target
ecological analogies?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you know, this is what we
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up in here, for example, we have a lot of
fens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the Cacarius wetlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms play a role in preserving fens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that may be irrelevant over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be some other habitat that farms
are playing a more important role in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to understand the distribution
of those target conservation communities
[SPEAKER_00]: is one aspect of what we want to try to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What role can nature play in supporting
Hudson Valley farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's going into that other part
of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can these natural areas also help
provide services to the farms themselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's technical questions in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we measure those services in a
relevant way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of what we're trying to work
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in collaboration with some people
here and some people at scenic Hudson and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
