[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be presenting on the work I've done
for the last three growing seasons here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with Justine Vanden Heuvel,
with Thomas Bjorkman and Anna Catherine
[SPEAKER_00]: Mansfield, also on my committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work here for my masters has centered
around using undervine cover crops as an
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide replacement in cool climate
Riesling vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go quickly over the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I even bothering to look at this?
[SPEAKER_00]: For my materials and methods, I did all my
experiments at two fields sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll go over the design at both of
them, my different results, and at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day, what can we say about this
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, it is pretty commonplace to
use cover crops at some point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season between vine rows, but it is almost
universally kept weed-free or
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation-free in the zone directly
beneath vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bare soil strip is maintained with a
combination or selection of herbicide and
[SPEAKER_00]: or cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done because growers perceive that
it would be a very negative effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: vines having vegetation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much support in the science
literature, but it's definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: perception, and that is why it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a risk when you
introduce an herbicide to a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are you increasing your chances
of resistance in the weed community,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're always offering the opportunity
for these herbicides to leach out or run
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of special concern when you're
growing vineyards above length,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in this region, and if you're worried
about contaminating your groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of whether you're using
herbicide or cultivation, bare soil is a
[SPEAKER_00]: big risk in terms of your soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of bare exposed soil is going to
be subject to crusting during a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall event, which leads to further
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get soil structure degradation,
decrease in organic matter, and also it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very subject to erosion any time soil is
left bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is of great concern when you have
vineyards planted on hillsides,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very common not only here in the
Finger Lakes, but worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all coupled with the fact that
if you look at kind of the state of the
[SPEAKER_00]: union of vineyard growth habits in this
region, we have a lot of very excessively
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growing vines, for lack of a
better phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that picture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shoots have not only well extended
beyond the trellising, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to grow into the next row.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have frequent rainfall throughout the
growing season, so water is rarely a
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many vineyards are planted on what just
happened to be very deep and fertile soil
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, so that's not a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also just have selected,
due to commercial and production reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: some varieties that just have a
particularly vigorous growth habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of this sort of creates the perfect
trifecta of growing more like jungles than
[SPEAKER_00]: little vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This excessive vegetative growth is a
problem because it is associated with very
[SPEAKER_00]: poor resulting grape and wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaded buds are less fruitful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the desirable aromas we want in
our wine are correlated with sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have 15 bazillion leaf layers
blocking them, you're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those conditions are really ripe for
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that leaf area is going to contribute
to a higher relative humidity and just
[SPEAKER_00]: make it harder to get into the canopy to
manage your fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, given that deleterious effect on
the vines from this excessive vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, we spend a lot of time and money
in vineyards maintaining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through it pretty much right from
the time shoots burst and have to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take out shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leaf thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll drop excess clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll drive tractors throughout the entire
season to hedge off those tops of shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all costly and takes lots of
time to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also, at the end of the day,
just treating the problem, not the source
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been successful research in
other humid climates that have this
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive growth problem in New Zealand,
Long Island, and Virginia that have shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you replace using herbicides
directly under vines and instead plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: very intentionally planted under vine
cover crop, not only are you eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide use, but you're actually getting
a positive, de-vigorating effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as this Californian can tell you,
the Finger Lakes is pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we aren't as warm as these other
regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have sort of a different management
practicality to work around.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the winter, we mound up a lot of soil
around the graft unions of vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European grapevines you guys are going
to be familiar with, including Riesling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what my research is done on,
are all planted on root stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we ever had a really hard freeze,
these vines would kill to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you're going to be left with is
your root stock, which isn't going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce your fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're pretty much back to square one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by hilling up this dirt all over those
graft unions, you're ensuring the survival
[SPEAKER_00]: of some scion buds, which come the spring,
you hill back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow up your Riesling or your
cabfronk or whatever it may be from those
[SPEAKER_00]: surviving buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not back to square one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have some work ahead of you,
but you're not devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, at the end of the day, crop
insurance requires growers to hill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of whether you're going to
take the chance or not, you're pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given this need to hill up vines in the
winter and hill them back down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, we have to operate on a kind of a
different system, vineyard floor
[SPEAKER_00]: management system, than these other
regions, which showed success with looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at permanently established perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my objective for my master's
work was to look at annually established
[SPEAKER_00]: undervine cover crop species as an
alternative to herbicide in Finger Lakes
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesling vineyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hypothesize that given this very common
excessive vegetative growth habit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Riesling grapevines in the region,
that there will be no deleterious effect
[SPEAKER_00]: by introducing this undervine cover crop
vegetation with the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, if anything, predict that
there would be a positive outcome by
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing this vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my data sort of stemmed on two sides of
looking at the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was looking at different
measures of vegetative growth right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and subsequently taking some rough
measures of vine nutrient and water
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: For water, I looked at midday and pre-dawn
stem water potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about those later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a quick moment, because I'll
mention it several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enhanced Point Quadrant Analysis,
or EPQA, is a way of quantifying the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, canopy characteristics,
the number of leaves, the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, those sorts of things,
and the light environment within the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Jim Myers did for his PhD,
a former student of Justine's.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now a postdoc for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's building upon his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then petioles were collected at
Verizon for nutrient analysis for that
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't just watch the vines grow all
season, but I do, in fact, harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different measures at harvest are
taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the subsequent juice is analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks is our measures of sugar,
so the soluble solids in the juice,
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar is really important, because in
fermentation, sugar goes out to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: TA is short for titratable acidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really important for your
perception of acid in the wine and juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, not only is it related to acid,
but really important for microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: stability in wines, so we don't have bugs
that we don't want growing in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: tainting your wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yan is short for yeast-assimable
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important, because yeast are
biota, a living organism, and we want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to do our bidding of converting sugar to
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to provide them with enough
nutrients for them to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have low nitrogen values,
fermentations can get stuck and sluggish,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting off aromas, and at the end of the
day, not completing your fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's an important value to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also subjected these wines to a
sensory analysis, looking at differences
[SPEAKER_00]: perceived in wine aroma, which I'll also
talk about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you an idea of the abbreviated
season we're working with, in May,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get bud break.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when grapevines are de-hilled,
that soil is pushed back down from the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also when I begin to establish my
underbine cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: By bloom, which occurs in mid-June,
you can see that's the second picture at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not pretty like the apples,
but it happens nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cover crops have emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also typically when growers will
start having to manage any kind of excess
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start going in and shoot thinning,
they might adjust cluster crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also when I start looking at the
water potential readings, and I start
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking shoot lengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verazan is a really critical time in our
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verazan is the fancy word we have for when
ripening really starts to accelerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when sugar starts to rapidly
accumulate in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid levels start to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In red varieties, you get the green to red
color shift change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the whites, you do get a color
shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes from those bright, hard green
berries to the skin soften.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Riesling, it turns a nice kind of
bright yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest roughly happened late September to
most likely early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when all the fruit's taken off the
vines, I take different yield components,
[SPEAKER_00]: I crush the fruit, analyze the juice,
and the juice is then put through
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation to be completed wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: By November, we are hilling our grapevines
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of would be the end date
then for my undervine cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have a giant cultivation
operation underneath the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, the vines have pretty much
gone dormant and have leached up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're preparing to hibernate in the
winter like I wish I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I do make wine from the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of a standard white wine
fermentation procedure that in general was
[SPEAKER_00]: held for both of my lots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to note here is that for
each treatment, there are duplicate lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of wine made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole idea is, since this is a
viticultural trial, I'm trying to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: hands off as possible in the oenological
process and try to allow characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: in the vineyard to be carried through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using a yeast that doesn't throw
off a lot of interesting aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chaplize or add sugar to a standard
sugar level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I supplement the yeast or the yam level to
make sure these yeast are going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to co, and I do ferment these wines to
dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the multi-dimensional sorting
analysis by wine aroma, the big fancy word
[SPEAKER_00]: for my sensory tests, in short,
all the duplicate lots were presented to
[SPEAKER_00]: panelists, and they were asked to sort
wines by similarity into groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found a wine to be similar to
another wine, you put them in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you found them to be different,
you put them in different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets a lot of grouping data that's
then run through SAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can give you a visual
representation of the differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'll be showing you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two field sites that I did my
research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first was a commercial vineyard on the
east side of Seneca Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: These vines were older, almost 20 years
old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted on a honey always silt loam,
Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to note here is it's a
Scott Henry training system, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is both an upper and lower fruiting
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because we'll often do
this in vineyards that have sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this already has been done at this
vineyard, and we were still seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying cover crops were originally
planted in 2011 and carried through
[SPEAKER_00]: through this year in a randomized complete
block design with four replicates per
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My four treatments were as such,
annual ryegrass planted in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: May.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a later establishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: While planted in the middle of May,
it doesn't really get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed the most biomass
accumulation much later in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as July, August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grows well through October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat, that beautiful white flowering
plant, seeded in late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting about buckwheat is it frost
kills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'd be ideal for a kind of
abbreviated time frame that we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat also has a lot of notoriety
right now because work out of Berkeley and
[SPEAKER_00]: work by Gray Globe here has shown that it
could potentially increase the incidence
[SPEAKER_00]: of generalist predators in the vineyard
and increase rates of parasitism of
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of interest around
buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural vegetation, polite word for it,
for wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow them to grow throughout the
season, whatever may be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our control is the traditional
glyphosate spray applied one to two times
[SPEAKER_00]: a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The underlying cover crop treatments were
mowed as needed to keep them from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up being one to two times a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second site is the Cornell Orchards at
Lansing in one of the recently blocks that
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of inherited from Ian Merwin's old
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, these vines were originally planted
in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: It once again is a two tier flat bow,
which is a double canopy fruiting system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that picture that I used on the slide
about excessive vigor came from this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can assure you that there's a lot of
excess vigor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These treatments were originally
established in 2012 and carried up this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This site's a little complicated,
so I'll do my best to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undervine cover crops were planted down
the entire lengths of rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each cover crop was planted down four rows
in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is then an overlay of irrigation at
this site that allows me to irrigate half
[SPEAKER_00]: of a given row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which half is irrigated alternates down
the rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole site is in total just under one
acre to put that size into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I initiated irrigation when the average
midday leaf stem water potential exceeded
[SPEAKER_00]: minus eight bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rough threshold for when vine
water status tends to be inhibiting
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where that number came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, we irrigated three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, it never actually got that dry to
need to irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did analyze it in case there was any
kind of a carryover effect with the
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was just simply the case this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three undervine cover treatments here
was the buckwheat, which I talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same glyphosate sprayed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did here was look at chicory,
which is sort of a different growth habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the rest are pretty much straight
annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicory is a biannual, which often acts as
a short-lived perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its first year, you can see it had that
nice, low-growing rosette form established
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, even though I reseeded and
there was a complete cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, obviously some survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shot up all these, not only the
low-growing rosette form, but all those
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to note about the chicory
that makes it sort of different is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest tend to be relatively shallow-rooted
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chicory is this nice, deep taproot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were taken very early in the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was doing soil sampling just a few
weeks ago, I found chicory roots going
[SPEAKER_00]: past even 20 centimeters in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just looking at a very different
growing habit of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question, were my cover crops
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I look at this question if they
weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, in short, at all three sites,
the cover crops established.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, at my first site, I had mowed once
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they have much lower values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's of interest to note.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case a grower was ever worried about it
going out of control, mowing does
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiently decrease a lot of the biomass
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: In both other years, you can see antlerye
grass and buckweed established well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with a fair amount of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in all years at both sites,
the control was essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the biennial growth habit of
chicory reflected in the biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: with it being relatively low in that first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it was present this last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buckweed was relatively consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my first measures of vegetative
growth was looking at cane diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a bit of a Goldilocks story.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to prune in the winter,
we don't want a cane that's too thick or
[SPEAKER_00]: too thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rough ideal that some people argue
is about pencil thickness, or six
[SPEAKER_00]: millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: At my first site, there were never any
significant differences made on cane
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at my second site, in this last year,
chicory actually did significantly reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the cane diameter down to six millimeters
from just around seven compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might not be a big difference,
but it definitely was a lower value that's
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to what we would consider more
ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I tracked shoot lengths and
could subsequently calculate shoot growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rates throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my first site, there was never an
effect in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this last year, natural vegetation
actually did have a greater shoot growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate in the early July time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at my second site, there was never any
significant effect on shoot growth rate by
[SPEAKER_00]: the undervine cover crop treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this EPQA I was talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the first site, the annual ryegrass,
the buckweed, and the natural vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: never affected any of the canopy
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for the first year at site
number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in this last year, chicory did
significantly affect canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduced the total number of leaf layers
in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduced the occlusion layer number,
which means the number of shade producing
[SPEAKER_00]: layers in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not surprisingly, if you have
fewer shade producing layers and fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, it actually increased the cluster
exposure flux availability, which is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase for the light exposure on clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph here, as you move left to right
on the x-axis, you're moving from deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: shaded fruit to highly exposed fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our world, we tend to want more
exposed fruit for disease management
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the tall blue bar and the
yellow bars are the control treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they by far and large were dominated
by deeply shaded fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you come and look over here
at the more exposed regions, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: two chicory treatments that had much more
exposed fruit than the buckweed was,
[SPEAKER_00]: yet again, in an intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we prune in the winter, we'll
calculate all that growth from the last
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first site, there was no
significant difference among pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011 and 2012, 2013 data will be
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't have that for you yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at my second site, what's
interesting here is that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a significant cover crop by
irrigation interaction effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the irrigated control yielded a
significantly higher pruning weight than
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-irrigated buckweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only definitive relation
that really came out in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pre-dawn water potential, which at this
point I think almost everyone in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: has heard me complain about, is when I go
out to the vineyard at 3.30 in the morning
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is no transpiration on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when the vine water status
will have equilibrated the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm getting a rough measure on soil
moisture where the rooting zone grape
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, there were no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, there was one significant
difference at my first site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control was significantly slightly
less water stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more negative the value, the more
water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would just like to point that
negative one and a quarter bars to
[SPEAKER_00]: negative half a bar is hardly what we
would call water stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, minus eight was the limit that
we began to see in inhibition of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just essentially very
well-hydrated vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same goes for site number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were never any significant
differences in this pre-dawn water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going from the least amount of stress
to the most amount of stress a vine is
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, mid-day stem water potentials are
taken at solar noon and kind of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum potential water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: For site number one, there was never any
significant differences in the mid-day
[SPEAKER_00]: stem water potential among the cover crop
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: For site number two, there was never any
significant difference in the mid-day stem
[SPEAKER_00]: water potentials among treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those black arrows indicate when
irrigation was initiated in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see by the graph,
2013 was just a much wetter year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just never received that level of water
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those vines were very well-hydrated,
even with the presence of an undervine
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at, see if there's a potential
nutrient effect of having these undervine
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops right there in the rooting
zone of the vine, we took petiole tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: at Verizon, sampled and submitted for
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013 data is still pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the data from 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall story here is that there is no
overall story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no consistent effect that I
could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, annual ryegrass actually
increased the levels of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the herbicide control and
increased levels of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the second site, there was no effect on
any of the nutrients except for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see yet again, there was this
interaction effect where the irrigated
[SPEAKER_00]: control had significantly more nitrogen
than both the buckwheat treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at harvest, we look at different
measures of yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at the total number of clusters per
vine, so a lot of counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we weigh these total clusters on
a per vine basis to get a yield per vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then calculate an average weight
per individual cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from those clusters, I take
individual berries and weigh them out so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can get an average weight per berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, you can calculate on
average how many berries there were per
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my site number one, there was never
a terribly consistent effect except for
[SPEAKER_00]: that annual ryegrass did influence the
number of berries per cluster,
[SPEAKER_00]: having significantly fewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the cluster weight was slightly
smaller, but significantly so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually the buckwheat treatment,
but no terribly consistent effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a moment here to explain what
the Rivas index is too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very common measure in the grape
and wine community to help evaluate the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of reproductive to vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is on a per vine basis,
take the total yield in fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how much that fruit weighed in
kilograms, divided by the pruning weight
[SPEAKER_00]: we harvest that subsequent winter from the
vine in kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it essentially ends up as kilograms or
over kilograms or a unitless ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what exactly the ideal ratio is,
that's a wonderfully debated subject,
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say anywhere between four to
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say 10 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see here there was no
significant effect on this ratio at this
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual ryegrass, buckwheat, control for
the glyphosate and nat short for natural
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I did see fewer berries per
cluster and in one year I saw a reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: For site number two, in 2012 there were no
differences in any of these components,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in 23, chicory did have a pretty
consistent effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the total number of clusters per
vine was not affected, the yield per vine
[SPEAKER_00]: was significantly reduced with chicory
present under the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do that math, it's not too
surprising to figure out that the cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, the individual clusters weighed
less when the chicory was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subsequently also the berries were smaller
for the chicory treatment and the total
[SPEAKER_00]: number of berries per cluster was smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get back to you on if there was
any difference in 2012 for the Rivas
[SPEAKER_00]: index, but there wasn't for 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this fruit is then crushed into juice
and analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For site number one, the annual ryegrass,
buckwheat, and natural vegetation compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the glyphosate spray control had no
significant differences on the bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the sugar content, our titratable
acidity, the pH, or the yeast-dissimable
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen of the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For site number two, for 2012,
what was interesting is at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season the buckwheat actually had a
significantly lower acid level,
[SPEAKER_00]: lower titratable acidity than the
glyphosate control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the end of the season at harvest,
it was actually the chicory that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduced titratable acidity
by just under one gram per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was never any cover crop effect on
the sugar, the pH, or the yam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wine aroma sensory.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, once you do all this grouping
data, you get a visual representation of
[SPEAKER_00]: how people found the wines to be similar
by aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closer two points are together on
these graphs indicate the more similar by
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma they were found to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, you can see that while buckwheat
and natural vegetation were found to yield
[SPEAKER_00]: more similarly aromatic wines,
all the underbine treatments were found to
[SPEAKER_00]: be different by aroma than control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2012, that same trend kind of
continued with the buckwheat and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: being found to be pretty damn different
than the control by aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my second site, here I'll note that
actually at the previous site there were
[SPEAKER_00]: eight wines presented to panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, duplicate lots of wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were four treatments, so eight wines
were presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this site, there were 12 wines
presented because I have six treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat irrigated and non-irrigated,
chicory irrigated and non-irrigated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my control irrigated and
non-irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: 53 panelists participated, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you were asked to sort them
between one and six groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I could have created a
more equidistant point graph than what the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's potentially a trend here with the
control and buckwheat non-irrigated at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom being kind of similar in a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, you want to analyze these
graphs by groupings, but it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: rough here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, the control irrigated and
the chicory irrigated potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, what is interesting to note
is that these wines were found to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different aromatically and that the
irrigation and cover crops were the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that made them different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note that these
underbine cover crops did yield
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different amounts of above
ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important if you're looking to
adopt this as part of your vineyard floor
[SPEAKER_00]: management system, understanding that
these cover crops are establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: different depending on species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, underbine cover crops did not
significantly impact measures of vine
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two exceptions being that in this last
year, natural vegetation essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: doubled the shoot growth rate at one point
in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that chicory, in its second year of
establishment, reduced cane diameter and
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of leaf layers in the canopy
which resulted in greater cluster exposure
[SPEAKER_00]: to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underbine cover crops were not found to
significantly affect pre-dawn or mid-day
[SPEAKER_00]: stem water potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly, there was no consistent
effect on the petiole nutrient content
[SPEAKER_00]: taken at Verizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These points are important to note because
the whole premise of why growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: spending a lot of money and a lot of time
to keep a vegetation-free zone under vines
[SPEAKER_00]: is they fear there will be some kind of
water or nutrient effect on the vines,
[SPEAKER_00]: which my work has at least preliminarily
shown and confirmed with past work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this just isn't the case, at least in
this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underbine cover crops, on the whole,
were not found to also impact harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important if a grower,
especially a lot of growers here,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not making tons of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their costs of management are quite
expensive for any of the viniferas,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Riesling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they cannot take a hit in yield
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to note that for most
of the species tested, there were no
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one major exception being that
chicory, in its second year of
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment, significantly reduced vine
yield and cluster size by 25%,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the berries per cluster and berry
mass was reduced by 14%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will interestingly note, though,
that viticulture is not the business of
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the business of optimizing
whatever the winemaker perceives as the
[SPEAKER_00]: wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is often a notion that too much
yield will have detriment to wine quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, many vineyard managers pay
lots of money to have crews go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: drop crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this reduced yield actually may not be
quite the deal breaker most people are
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of in our industry that could
actually be saving you a pass in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard with your crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, some people do prefer smaller
berry size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this reduced berry mass could be
beneficial if that's what you were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to achieve in your vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, underbine cover crops were not
impacting your juice composition,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the exception being that chicory at
harvest did reduce titratable acidity by
[SPEAKER_00]: one gram per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're happy with your juice
characteristics, then hey, it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: underbine cover crops probably won't mess
with that, except for maybe chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, too, I would argue that a one gram
per liter reduction could be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone here has tasted our
wonderful Finger Lakes Riesling,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes they can be a little acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropping this by one gram per liter could
be desirable to certain winemakers' goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a few of my data measures,
including the pruning weights and petiole
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, there was a significant cover
crop by irrigation interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of interesting to note
because it's indicating that these
[SPEAKER_00]: underbine cover crops could have varying
effect in different soil moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding your specific site and
any variability in your site could be
[SPEAKER_00]: really critical if you're looking to adapt
this to your vineyard floor management
[SPEAKER_00]: plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one consistent effect that we saw year
after year was that wine aroma was
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by the presence of underbine
cover crops in all years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I just talked about a lot of how my
data was not significantly impacting
[SPEAKER_00]: measures of vine growth or water status or
nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few theories on this,
so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That EPQA measurement I took that
evaluated the canopy characteristic and
[SPEAKER_00]: light penetration of the canopy,
I took once at Verizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, I took nutrient status of the
vine via petiole tissue sampling once at
[SPEAKER_00]: Verizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is known from work out of our lab,
Misha, who just graduated with a PhD from
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavin Sachs in food science, he did work
with Justine that showed the timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster light exposure can dramatically
affect concentrations of TDN.
[SPEAKER_00]: TDN is that very characteristic petrol
gasoline aroma that Riesling is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: famous for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did the timing of cluster
light exposure impact these important
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma precursors in Riesling, but the
overall cluster light exposure,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Myers from our lab just put out a
paper showing that very important aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors in the fruit that create a lot
of characteristic Riesling aromas are
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by the quantity of cluster light
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only looked at these differences in
cluster light exposure at one point in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, at Verizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were differences earlier in the
season or later in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could have had dramatic effects on
aroma precursors and I was simply unable
[SPEAKER_00]: to detect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same idea with nutritional differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there were a nutritional difference
early in the season or much later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season than Verizon that was affecting the
biosynthesis of these aroma precursors in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grapes, I wouldn't have been able to
detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are sort of our biggest theories,
especially when it comes to the cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: light exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing not to rule out is that
green volatiles could be impacting wine
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am introducing a lot of vegetation
directly underneath the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very preliminary work from Justine
and Dr. Gavin Sachs has shown that hedging
[SPEAKER_00]: materials directly under the vines can
impact certain characteristics of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of taking it the next step further
too, we also know that decomposing plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues do give off green volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've introduced a lot of it
into the vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is that potential interaction
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do I go from here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent three growing seasons studying
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've actually just received a
Northeast SARE graduate student grant to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue my work at my second field site,
the site at Lansing, looking at if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a potential more long term, four plus
years of effect of under-vine cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to be able to continue that
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, since we do know that these
wine aromas were perceived as very
[SPEAKER_00]: different when under-vine cover crops were
present, doing the more chemical side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, looking at potential compounds
that could be responsible for these
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further preference testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I can tell you from those graphs is
that the wines were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you if that was a good or bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So preference testing would allow me to
better analyze that and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: potential consumer reactions of being sold
wine that was grown without herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we're still sort of on the
search for the holy grail of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trickery is showing some promise,
but an under-vine cover crop that could
[SPEAKER_00]: compete on a level to actually see this
reduction in vegetative growth would still
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to be a goal since we do still
have this excessively vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: habit in the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, understanding how your
vineyard floor management decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: including using herbicide compared to an
under-vine cover crop, are affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: iota of your entire agro ecosystem could
be something that would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are works cited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all in science stand on the shoulders
of the giants before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, there's so many people I'd
like to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially want to thank Eric and the
Cornell Orchards crew and John Wagner out
[SPEAKER_00]: at Wagner Vineyards for allowing a
graduate student to run amok in their
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards and making their life,
I know, more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without their hard work, I wouldn't
have been able to do any of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to especially take a moment to
thank the Cornell Drearer Committee,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I am the fortunate recipient of
the Frederick Drearer Award this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm basically counting the days till I
will be leaving for Marlboro, where I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be going off to Sauvignon Blanc country
for quite a while, where, of all things,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be doing some under-vine cover crop
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also accepted a lab tech position
with Indavan Wine Company to work the 2014
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've accepted continuing on for my PhD,
working here with Justine, to continue on
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of the work that I've done here
and presented today to you for my
[SPEAKER_00]: master's.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, I'd be happy to take any
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, everyone, for listening.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was in relation to the
fact that the annual ryegrass treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibited higher levels of phosphorus and
iron and had certain yield effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't bring it up at all in your
conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not a predominant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of berries per cluster was
significant, but not on a level that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have been shot from the rooftops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only the one year that we saw a
reduction in cluster size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my sort of response is that,
yes, we certainly think the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota and all that could be
dramatically affecting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil side of the under-vine cover
crops is more the project of it was Becky
[SPEAKER_00]: Sirianni and Adam Karl in our lab has
taken over and looking a lot at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely, it's something to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's unique in this situation
that could be dramatically affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil biota is the fact that we have
hilling up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially doing a giant
mulching of these decomposing or cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops into the soil every winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're mixing it all up again in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's potentially where you're
getting some of these interesting effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how these plants are decomposing too
could have some dramatic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly, it's something of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, those results were a little
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still waiting to get results back
from our Cornell Nutrient Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get those, I'll be able to
further see if this is a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: year-to-year effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is about training of the
sensory individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, they weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this sort of study, you do not want
trained individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are given an explicit set of
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are allowed to ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can expand on the procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is that I am looking for a
just normal white wine consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one limitation was that, on average,
you drink white wine about once a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for wine drinkers,
not just anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this wasn't what you might be thinking
of, which is called a descriptive analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: panel, where you have explicit training on
the different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have training on what you think the
characteristics are in this type of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then subsequently, the standards of
lemon flavor or standards of acid flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not supposed to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about your own perception of the
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking to identify aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's however you perceive them to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You group them accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, is there a tendency in
difference testing to find more
[SPEAKER_00]: differences than may exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the risk when you're asking
someone to find differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be prone to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say they are presented with the
option of putting them all in one group,
[SPEAKER_00]: which people did if they found that there
were no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it is always a problem,
there's always a problem like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, with almost any sensory test you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some bias that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this test was pretty
representative of being able to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said at the end of the day,
all I can say is differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell if they were preferred or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively, they might have been different
from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, compared to all the wines in
the world, they weren't that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that, because I didn't have
any other externally tested wines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a balance that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about mycorrhizal
biomass and where I'm having these cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, potentially a nutrient effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not looked at that in any kind of
scientific form for me to actually say
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a difference or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing quick research on these cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that potential, especially with
chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely know just doing my soil
samples, I saw them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still waiting to get some of the
research potentially back this year about
[SPEAKER_00]: the chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in short, I just don't know if that's
on the soil side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely a direction that
would be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would I recommend to the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say if you're a grower who is
looking to reduce their inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think every viticulturist should
be doing, and if you are relatively happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with your vineyard, I think looking at
these annual undervine cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially something like buckwheat,
which was pretty well controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weeds were relatively low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It established very consistently year to
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just was not seeing effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say why not try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why risk using herbicide over and over,
destroying your vine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Destroying your soil structure,
destroying your soil health when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then potentially something like
chicory, which was showing that potential
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial reduction in yield,
which is a weird phrase to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's how our industry is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say why not try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of perception that
people are really afraid of the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops getting close to the fruiting zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely mowed at the first site
because it was a commercial vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did not touch anything at the second
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it grow, including those
flowering stalks of chicory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while maybe management-wise,
it wasn't pretty and offered a little few
[SPEAKER_00]: more difficulties, at the end of the day,
though, that was about as minimal
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance as I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still a pretty well-established
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say from growers is that
it's unlikely you're going to be seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatic effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not try it and see what works for your
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are growers ready to
change practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: The world of viticulture is notorious for
its the slowest rate of adoption curve
[SPEAKER_00]: ever in terms of any agricultural field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are based in history, rules on how we
grow things, how we make our wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally law on how you make your
wine in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are growers ready to change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's always early adopters who
benefit from this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely one grower in this
region who plants buckwheat not only as an
[SPEAKER_00]: interrow cover crop, but just everywhere,
under vines, in rows, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's willing to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll always have those people who are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's stepping away a bit of
that perception of that very nice-looking
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyard of how having vegetation free and
stepping more into maybe more of the agro
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem management perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, vineyards are also
places where people host weddings and
[SPEAKER_00]: those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always hard for me to remove that
when I'm, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: asking a grower to do something a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the chicory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think even though the resulting vine
water status isn't that different because
[SPEAKER_00]: these are own-rooted vines that,
while grown with some irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think these roots are going
incredibly deep, as we can see off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe while the whole vine
water status isn't being that affected,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are having to rely on drawing water
from those deeper roots than the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the roots where the cover crop
is actively growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there might be some of that
just physiological differences that are
[SPEAKER_00]: causing some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, it is known that pre-verazen
water deficits will significantly impact
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mark Matthew's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe there were just some
differences, but just so slight that
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically they weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't really have a great
answer to that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it has a lot to do with just
the sensitivity of my measurements and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some physiological processes going
on in the vine that I'm not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I establish my cover crops by hand seeding
and hand cultivating over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that glorious, but it was
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sufficiently emerged every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was to be adopted on a larger
scale, we understand most growers are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be willing to walk over their
acres and acres of vineyards with hand
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's interest and potential with a
few of our collaborators in the extension
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things that have been coming up
with different ideas of how to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: this on a vineyard level scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I know that right now is just
me, myself, and I have labor of hand
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the questions about the site to site
differences, which there certainly was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, I think there were differences
by the nature of the age of the vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, that first site was almost
20-year-old vines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second site here, these vines are
younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just a little less
fertile, a little less deep soil of a
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting to know, though,
the one carryover cover crop of buckwheat
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much had no significant effects at
either site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of my take home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more and less vigorous
sites here in the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have vineyards planted on the whole
range of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, I was trying to
take a step back from what I can say at
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what could I say about the general
trend of using underfine cover crops as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there certainly were site
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something to consider for any
grower if they were looking to change up
[SPEAKER_00]: their vineyard floor management is how
their site may differ.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both these sites were relatively
fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both sites were exhibiting excessive
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they were so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please help yourself to any food
remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm up here if you want any further
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
