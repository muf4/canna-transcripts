[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I think after a long day,
now it's time for me, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: to entertain you for the next hour or so
and try to keep you awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I thought what I should do is
share and discuss with you our more recent
[SPEAKER_00]: work on microbial association with healthy
plants and also proposed functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: of these microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since this is very much an emerging
research field, I thought it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate to give a brief introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so personally, I believe that really
one of the more profound discoveries in
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular plant-microbe interactions
during the last decade has been the
[SPEAKER_00]: observation that healthy asymptomatic
plants in nature live in association with
[SPEAKER_00]: a rich diversity of microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in simple terms, the sum of the
microorganisms that live in association
[SPEAKER_00]: that colonize healthy asymptomatic plants,
that's what's called the plant microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important that really for
association of healthy plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that we see association with
different microbial classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see, for example, association with
bacteria, we have association with
[SPEAKER_00]: protists, and we have also associations
with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbes that live in association
with above ground plants, that's often
[SPEAKER_00]: called the phyllosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbes that live in association
with below ground parts, particularly the
[SPEAKER_00]: root, this is called the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what I thought would be useful to
structure my presentation today,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'll do is in the first part of my
lecture, I will tell you what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned about the bacteria bacterial plant
microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the last maybe 10,
15 minutes, I'll tell you some recent
[SPEAKER_00]: findings of association between healthy
plants and root-associated fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this might be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get started with the bacterial
root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's now widely accepted that
essentially all flowering plants in nature
[SPEAKER_00]: are densely colonized by bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy asymptomatic plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally millions of bacteria
colonize the leaf surface and the
[SPEAKER_00]: interior, and it's very similar to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find zillions of bacteria that colonize
the root surface and also the root
[SPEAKER_00]: interior.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is slightly more controversial is the
source of inoculum of these
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf-associated bacteria, because leaves
thrive in a natural open environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very clear that there are
multiple sources for these leaf-associated
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is quite different from the root
microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now also, I think, widely accepted
that bacteria that live in unplanted soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: that those bacteria defines the bacterial
start inoculum for the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has some experimental advantages
that I will explain to you later during my
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are proposed microbiota functions
for the plant host?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these include nutrient mobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly strong evidence that
many root-associated bacteria help plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to mobilize nutrients for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant growth promotion has been
repeatedly reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's evidence for indirect pathogen
protection, and I will report on that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aboardic stress tolerance and increased
fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost too good to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one has to be really skeptical,
because many of these claims are
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, many of these claims are
based on mono-associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one microbiota member plus one host
under laboratory conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the community context is frequently
missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one needs to really take these claims
with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our long-term questions that
we would like to address for our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can healthy plants establish intimate
associations with microbial communities?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can plants discriminate between
beneficial and pathogenic microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is not understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, how do plant-associated
microbial communities promote plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really what guides our research
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's have a closer look into the
root-associated bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known actually since more than 100
years that roots growing in natural soil
[SPEAKER_00]: live in intimate association with a
diverse range of soil-borne bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's some evidence now that
it's really organic compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: actively exuded by roots into soil that
those serve as chemical cues and attract
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-borne bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these bacteria then become
enriched on the root surface, and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them also make it inside the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are bacterial root endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two numbers that I would
like you to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first number is really that soil,
so unplanted soil, is an incredibly rich
[SPEAKER_00]: compartment on this globe for bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one gram of soil contains between 10
to the 7 to 10 to the 9 bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, roots are growing in a
bacterial broth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a remarkable observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second important number is that about
10 to 20 percent of carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric carbon dioxide, that is fixed
by the Kelvin-Benson cycle in green
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, is extruded as organic carbon by
roots into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's substantial organic carbon
sequestration by plants into soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you ask, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do plants invest so much energy into
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Conceptually, I think the root is
analogous to the digestive tract of
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may ask why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the argument for this is both
organs, the digestive tract as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, are organs that are dedicated for
nutrient mobilization and nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is between the two systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a closed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an open system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, you can look at a root,
you know, as a digestive tract where the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside is turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I thought it might be useful,
if this works, to briefly explain to you
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we measure these root-associated
bacterial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, in a cartoon, explains the
fractionation of the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: root-associated bacterial microbiota,
which is now more or less a standard
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we grow our Arabidopsis
plants in natural soil, but in otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environmental conditions in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow them to bolting stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we harvest about three centimeter
long segments of Arabidopsis roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wash the roots and collect the soil
particles that physically adhere to the
[SPEAKER_00]: root surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is then what we call the
ricosphere compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And subsequent to the washing,
we apply a sonication step to deplete
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining epiphytic bacteria from the root
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we end up with these washed and
sonicated roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We homogenize the roots to release
bacteria that thrive inside roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is then what we call the root
compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a subsequent step,
we compare the bacterial communities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root compartment with the bacterial
communities in the ricosphere compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a control, the bacterial
communities present in unplanted natural
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you molecularly characterize
these bacterial communities?
[SPEAKER_00]: We and essentially most other groups in
microbial ecology use the bacterial 16S
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the most widely used DNA
sequence for taxonomic assignments of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's technically a relatively simple
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just use various PCR primer
combinations to amplify segments of this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the PCR amplicons are subjected
to pyroaluminal sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's relatively standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: What becomes important is the
computational or the bioinformatic
[SPEAKER_00]: processing of these 16S sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this, we developed a customized
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use at least 10,000 high quality reads
per sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the first step, there's a read
alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is perhaps the most critical
step, which is called complete linkage
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering, where all of the 16S RNA
sequences that share greater than 97%
[SPEAKER_00]: identity are used for the definition of a
strange term, which is called an
[SPEAKER_00]: operational taxonomic unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacterial OTU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea of the taxonomic,
of the resolution power of these OTUs,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is roughly between the bacterial
genus and the bacterial species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to keep in mind
this technology fails to discriminate
[SPEAKER_00]: between different strains of one and the
same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can resolve, in the best cases,
different bacterial species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get two types of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you examine a compartment, you can
define the number of different OTUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also obtain the relative
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know which one is abundant,
which one is a rare one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two informations are then used
for multivariate statistic analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we have a look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into our early work that was published now
some time ago, where our goal was to
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize the structure of the
Arabidopsis root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this purpose, we've grown our
plants in natural soils, but under
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've compared the root
associated bacteria with the bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in the rhizosphere compartment
and in the unplanted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is typically how we visualize
these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ternary plot, and I need to explain
to you how to read these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each dot represents a bacterial OTU,
as defined by its six in a sequence tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size indicates the relative
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say large dots represents
abundant bacteria, small dots,
[SPEAKER_00]: low abundance bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: More important is the position within this
triangle, because the position of a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular bacterial OTUs indicates the
relative abundance of a bacterium in these
[SPEAKER_00]: three compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've color coded here are
those bacteria that become enriched in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis roots relative to unplanted
soil and the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do the taxonomic assignments
of these root-enriched bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: root-enriched OTUs, they essentially
define three bacterial phyla.
[SPEAKER_00]: They correspond to three bacterial phyla,
which are called actinobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: protobacteria, and bacteriodates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relatively, at this high taxonomic
rank, a relatively simple taxonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major take-home message from
independent experiments carried out by
[SPEAKER_00]: Davide Bulgarelli and our lab in Cologne
and by Jeff Dangles' lab, by Derek
[SPEAKER_00]: Lundbeck in the US, really using soils
from two different continents in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: and US, is that soil type is the main
determinant of root-microbotic
[SPEAKER_00]: composition, how its genotype contributes
limited variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relatively simple take-home message.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since that time, when we examined
really the structure of the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: root microbiota and also some Arabidopsis
relatives, there were a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: additional studies now published.
[SPEAKER_00]: These include various crop plants,
barley, maize, grapevine, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite recently, we've done a
meta-study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply wanted to know how similar or
dissimilar is the root-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota in all of these different plant
species that span about 150 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result is actually shown in this
projection, where each of the dot
[SPEAKER_00]: represents a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proximity of the dots represents
the taxonomic similarity of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that essentially
the taxonomic structure of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota from these different plant
species is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we compare the taxonomic
structure of the root-associated bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota with the human gut microbiota,
there's essentially no overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although, as you recall, both the
vertebrate gut and the root are,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, physiologically equivalent
organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very clear the bacteria that
populate our digestive tract or of any
[SPEAKER_00]: other vertebrate are totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the major lesson from this is there's a
conserved taxonomic structure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial micro-root microbiota at phylum
rank, proto-bacteria, actinobacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteriodatus, and phimicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a highly conserved plant trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, about two years ago, we weren't
entirely satisfied with the type of work
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we felt we were really reaching a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what we were doing is we were
doing case control studies or time series
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied the 16S RNA gene community
profiling that I've explained to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've applied metagenome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we inferred from these results
hypotheses that are based on statistics,
[SPEAKER_00]: on advanced statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you really look closely in our
publications, these are correlations
[SPEAKER_00]: between multiple variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I'm trained as a geneticist,
I'm somewhat, I'm not satisfied if you end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with correlative observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt that there might be an
opportunity on the long run to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: new branch of plant microbiota research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this branch might involve really
systematic cultivation of the bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: plant microbiota, so high throughput
bacterial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if this were successful,
then we could design synthetic bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that we call SYNCOM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could add them to germ-free
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could test the hypotheses from
these experiments and make scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusions that are based on causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a potential caveat is that when we
were talking with our colleagues from
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental microbiology, that they told
us, well, whatever environmental sample
[SPEAKER_00]: you take, if you want to cultivate the
bacteria, you can only cultivate barely 1%
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that were true, then, of course,
you could say, well, is this entire
[SPEAKER_00]: approach realistic?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were reasons why we were
skeptical with the claims of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental microbiologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we therefore, about two or two and a
half years ago, we started to establish a
[SPEAKER_00]: reference culture collection of the
Arabidopsis root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work is now in press in the
British weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this involves, initially, we collect
roots, again, from plants grown in natural
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wash them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We homogenize the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just plate the root homogenates on agar
plates or on 96 microtiter plates with
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, by these two methods,
we've now been able to isolate more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 root-derived bacterial colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we determine just by sequencing
the 6S RNA gene sequences from all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these 5,800 bacterial colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why we call our culture
collection sequence indexed rhizobacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: libraries that are stored at minus 80
degrees and can be used then for
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequent experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, again, to remind you that our
root culture collection, these 5,800
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, that they are isolated from
Arabidopsis plants growing in cologne
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in parallel with our collaborator,
Julia Vorholt, at the ETH Zurich,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've also isolated leaf-associated
bacteria of Arabidopsis, about 3,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that these leaves were
harvested from Arabidopsis populations
[SPEAKER_00]: growing either surrounding Zurich or in
the vicinity of Tübingen, so at a
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in the next step, this is really
the most critical one because what we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed, what we had to do is to
cross-reference our culture-independent
[SPEAKER_00]: community data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 6S community profiling with a
culture-dependent approaches to really
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate what fraction of the root
microbiota can we actually recover as pure
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's shown on this slide,
where the inner circle, all of these small
[SPEAKER_00]: dots, they represent bacterial OTU,
root-associated bacterial OTUs from
[SPEAKER_00]: cologne soil-grown plants that we can
resolve by the 6S community profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the outer ring, these black
squares, they indicate hits in our culture
[SPEAKER_00]: collection from these 5,000 to 8,000
culture collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is shown here for the
leaf-derived bacterial culture collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, we've now recovered more than
60% of the root and the leaf-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is clearly not a perfect culture
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have some gaps, but it's
certainly way more than the 1% that the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial ecologist wanted us to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question then was,
so from these thousands of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: root and leaf-associated bacteria,
we've characterized really and assembled a
[SPEAKER_00]: core collection that is maximized for
phylogenetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's shown by these phylogenetic
trees in the center of these slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this represents the color code is
really according to bacterium phylum
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see actinobacteria,
bacteriophimica, and protobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we wanted to compare these two
culture collections, and we wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how similar or dissimilar are the bacteria
that associate with healthy roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is shown in the outermost ring by
these green arrowheads or by the brown
[SPEAKER_00]: arrowheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this denotes a strain from our
culture collection from leaves that shares
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 97% identical 6S sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, it's the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were quite surprised to learn that
40 to 50% of the root and leaf-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial isolates share greater than 97%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, are the same sequences and
the same bacterial species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this is notable because
recall, our root and leaf-derived culture
[SPEAKER_00]: collections were generated from plant
material of populations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically widely separated,
500 kilometers apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind for
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in the next step, we thought it
would be useful to determine whole genomes
[SPEAKER_00]: of all of our root and leaf-associated
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we generated whole genome assemblies
and also annotated the genomes of 432
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota members and then inferred a
whole genome phylogenetic tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is shown here, which is largely
congruent with a phylogenetic tree that is
[SPEAKER_00]: purely based on the bacterial 6S ribosomal
RNA gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is mainly archival, but I think
that genome sequences are, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very powerful resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that we were, of course,
interested in having now access to these
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome sequences is to study
genome-wide functional diversity between
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota members of the root and the
leaf microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we used for these experiments
were really keg-annotated genes or
[SPEAKER_00]: keg-annotated pathways, and then simply
compare how similar or dissimilar are
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes in these different genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is shown in these projections is
each dot represents a bacterial genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've color-coded the dots such that
the red dots represent root-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and the green dots represent
leaf-derived bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, proximity is a measure of
functional similarity or functional
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we noted is that we can clearly
resolve different clusters, functional
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, functional capabilities of these
bacteria in our culture collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the functional clusters, they mainly
correspond to bacterial phylogeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a strong phylogenetic signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you will see, in most of these
clusters, we find both root-associated and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf-associated members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be a strong functional
overlap of members from the root and the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually only very few
clusters where you can see a separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this level, we observed only weak
signatures for niche specialization at the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ruben Garido, he decided to take
this analysis one step further and to look
[SPEAKER_00]: really for differential enrichment of
functions at individual functional
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, for example, involves
carbohydrate metabolism, membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are high-level functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is shown here, this is the sheet
map and the relative proportion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are annotated to these
high-level biological functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the upper part, Ruben calculated
for differential enrichment between the
[SPEAKER_00]: root and the leaf microbiota members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he noted was there were two
functional categories, carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism and, I think, synobotics,
biodegradation, and metabolism,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we see a highly significant
difference between the root and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this level, we see clear evidence
for niche specialization at individual,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least at two individual functional
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, this might become
important later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I would like to come back to this
scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I've convinced you that we have
a decent culture collection from the root
[SPEAKER_00]: and the leaf microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the whole genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought now we're in the position
that we can use this culture collection
[SPEAKER_00]: and design synthetic bacterial
communities, add them to germ-free plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to then test a particular hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we call microbiota
reconstitution experiments in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this purpose, I need to introduce
to you calcine clay, which is an inert
[SPEAKER_00]: matrix for colonization of germ-free
aeratopsis plants with defined bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use this sterile calcine clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you inoculate the calcine clay
with defined input syncombs,
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously with a sowing of surface
sterilized aeratopsis seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you close the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow the plants together with the
microbes in a closed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a magenta box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple experimental system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was actually originally developed this
system by, in the Lotus Japonicus
[SPEAKER_00]: community by Jens Stugart in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after seven weeks, you determine
output syncombs of calcine clay without
[SPEAKER_00]: host roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you determine the output syncombs
in the roots and leaves using 6NS
[SPEAKER_00]: community profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to familiarize you how to read
these data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically display them by heat maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an experiment where we've added a
root-derived, 188-member syncombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from our culture collection,
these are all root-derived to curia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the input syncom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the numbers indicate biological
replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each row indicates a bacterial
replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each line represents either a single
bacterial strain or group of bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the color code indicates the relative
abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Color code is relative abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try for the input community inoculate
the bacteria at a one-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, after seven weeks, if we look at
the root output community, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a marked community shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this community shift can either be
dependent on the host, but it can also be
[SPEAKER_00]: host-independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to discriminate between those two
possibilities, we also incubated the input
[SPEAKER_00]: community for seven weeks just in
unplanted clay in the absence of the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see also a marked community shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you then compare the output
community in unplanted clay in roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you will note numerous changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the relative abundance of
this bacterium increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one barely grows in unplanted clay,
but in the presence of the root is really
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically enriched.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bacterium, which is dominant in the
absence of the host, becomes depleted from
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see really significant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the surprise came when we also
analyzed leaves from these bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seven weeks later, because we noted
that now many of the root-derived bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: can also colonize Arabidopsis leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an ectopic localization,
an ectopic colonization of these
[SPEAKER_00]: root-derived bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was somewhat surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the nice thing about this
experimental system, it's quite flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow those Arabidopsis plants
for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can open the magenta boxes and
you can spray them with a leaf-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you incubate them, co-incubate
them for another week, and then do
[SPEAKER_00]: community profiling after seven weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this slide shows the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a highly complex community,
226 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the input communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have only leaf-derived bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the root ones are negative,
are black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And expectedly, and we were quite pleased
about this, most of these leaf-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria can abundantly colonize leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not so surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the surprise, again, is if you now
look at the roots, then you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial proportion or subset of the
leaf-derived bacteria can ectopically also
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria from roots go up to leaves and
bacteria from leaves go down to roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have to quantify these
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we use a bit more
quantitative analysis of these community
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are principal components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analysis of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: In principle, each of these, or in simple
terms, each of these dots represents the
[SPEAKER_00]: community from a single magenta box with
four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've color-coded here,
this is the input community where we added
[SPEAKER_00]: the root-derived bacteria to the calcine
clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the output communities,
output communities in the absence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the root-associated output
community and the leaf-associated output
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clear that the root and the leaf
output communities are different,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also different from the output
communities in the absence of the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the host-independent community
shift, and this is the host-dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: community shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the second experiment that I
explained to you, where we spray inoculate
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf-derived bacteria to leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the input community,
output community on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ectopic colonization on roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take-home message from these
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root and leaf-derived syncoms colonize
cognate host organs, but they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of ectopic leaf and root
colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that was rather
unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summarize this part of my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We interpret these data such that the leaf
microbiota appears to be a derived form of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think really the major inoculum source
for leaf-associated bacteria are derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from root-associated bacteria and from
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based on an extensive species
intersection between the leaf and the root
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota using this culture-independent
community profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's also now support on
the basis of whole genome drafts,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 400 isolates, that reveal this
large overlap of genome-encoded functional
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities, but also significant
differences at the level of individual
[SPEAKER_00]: functional categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is now most strongly
supported by our microbiota reconstitution
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments showing that leaf and
root-derived syncoms colonize cognate host
[SPEAKER_00]: organs and are capable of ectopic leaf and
root colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this really raises the
possibility that bacteria from roots make
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to above-ground parts and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's an unexpected dynamic
between the leaf and the root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some evidence, I don't have
time to go into details.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also now strong evidence for
microbiota specimens crystallization to
[SPEAKER_00]: their respective niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that in the next five or ten
minutes I'd tell you a little bit more how
[SPEAKER_00]: we now take advantage of our culture
collections of the root microbiota to test
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed functions of the microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the proposed functions from an
early time point was really indirect
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now again a bottom-up approach
where we use this reconstitution
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments to test this function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this purpose, I need to introduce
to you Fusarium oxysporum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure many of you will be aware of this
fungal pathogen of Arabidopsis that
[SPEAKER_00]: severely inhibit Arabidopsis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow Arabidopsis just axenically
on agar plates, this is how it looks like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for germ-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you add Fusarium oxysporum,
the plants really grow very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one can actually visualize growth of
this Fusarium fungus by lectin staining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium oxysporum is a soil-borne
vascular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the fungal hyphae that surround
the Arabidopsis roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fungus also makes it into the
vasculature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this results in this severe
disease symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were wondering is,
and these are experiments from Yang Bai
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ke Hiruma, what would happen if we
co-inoculate our roots with Fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: oxysporum spores and individual root
microbiota from our culture collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the presence of this B1 bacterium plus
Fusarium oxysporum essentially rescues
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see also some rescue in the
presence of this bacterium, but this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium has no antifungal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this correlates, indeed, if you look
microscopically, the Fusarium hyphae in
[SPEAKER_00]: the presence of these bacteria are highly
distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in almost all cases, the fungus cannot
any longer enter the vasculature of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we had to do this more
systematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yang and Ke, they tested about 50 of
our rhizobacterial strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quantified the protective activity
of these bacteria against Fusarium
[SPEAKER_00]: infection by measuring shoot fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you incubate Arabidopsis plants
with Fusarium alone, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you grow them axenically,
this is the shoot fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the shoot fresh weight in
these ternary interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the host, the bacterium, and the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a range of infection
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can broadly define three categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: One category is these rhizobacteria where
there's unrespected Fusarium hyphae
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's intermediate growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these bacteria are really
strongly protect Arabidopsis against
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you overlay on these results,
those bacteria that are highly root
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched, you will note that in this
class, we find almost only bacteria that
[SPEAKER_00]: are highly root enriched members of the
microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are taxonomically quite diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our hypotheses on the basis of
this result was that evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: selection might have favored root
microbiota members with strong protective
[SPEAKER_00]: activity against soil-borne pathogenic
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stefan Hakar, a post-doc in the lab,
he decided to test this hypothesis by
[SPEAKER_00]: extending our work from Fusarium oxysporum
to another soil-borne, really economically
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant pathogen, viticillium dali and
Plectrospirella cocomorina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another root-infecting colitotrichum
pathogen, colitotrichum incarnum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he decided, rather than using this
time-consuming and really complex
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment with the fungus, the host,
and the bacterium, just to test binary
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just co-incubate the fungal pathogens
and the individual rhizobacteria from our
[SPEAKER_00]: culture collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he tested a total of 90 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he developed a quantitative
readout to measure fungal growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these co-cultures, so this is all done
in 96 micro titer plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results of these testing,
the interactions of these individual
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobacteria with these four different
fungi, the results are shown in from
[SPEAKER_00]: triplicate experiments for each of the
four fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are visualized by a heat map
where the cool blue colors indicate fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: growth inhibition and the red colors
indicate growth promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we could see is that the individual
phylogenetic lineages of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiota that confer a strong protective
activity against all of these four fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, these arpobacter,
then the pseudomonas here, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mesorhizobium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other ones, the
streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very potent against Fusarium
oxysporum, but their activity against
[SPEAKER_00]: Plectrospirella cocomorina is lousy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so based on these results,
and when we compare the results from these
[SPEAKER_00]: binary interactions screen with these
tritrophic interactions system,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will note that there's clear overlap
between the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we conclude from these experiments
is that specific taxonomic lineages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial root microbiota, it's a direct
inhibitory activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily need the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And against a wide range of soil-borne
pathogenic root colonizing fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we infer from these experiments
that indirect protection against
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-borne fungal pathogen is a major
physiological function of the Arabidopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially it looks as if Arabidopsis
really recruits a subset of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that many of these root-associated and
root-enriched bacteria help the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect itself against attack from these
soil-borne fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could still criticize us and you
could say, well, you know, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've just tested one fungus,
one bacterium and one host.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not in the community context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really now, I think,
going in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we've now tested, this is in the
calcine clay system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just focus on this one,
these are germ-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when we add 30 of our bacterial
rhizobacteria that we've tested also in
[SPEAKER_00]: the binary or in the tritrophic
interaction system, the plants still grow
[SPEAKER_00]: happily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is if we really incubate the
plants with our deadly mix of four
[SPEAKER_00]: soil-borne fungal pathogens, then the
plants essentially die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you add then the fungal community
and the 30 microbiota members,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see this rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this suggests really that the
protection against the soil-borne pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: also can be reproduced under laboratory
conditions in a community context.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, do I still have, yes,
I think I still have 10 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I promised that during the last
part of my presentation, and also because
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria is in the audience, I mentioned in
my introduction that the root,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant microbiota does not involve
only bacteria, but there are also
[SPEAKER_00]: association between healthy plants and
fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this illustrates the beautiful
biodiversity of fungi, root-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi that we've isolated from Arabidopsis
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all fungal endophytes
that we've isolated from surface
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized Arabidopsis roots grown in
natural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one difficulty with the fungal
endophytes or with the fungal microbiota,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, is that plant-associated
fungi are hyper-diverse in natural plant
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is fundamentally different from
the bacterial root microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recall, I mentioned to you, there's a
highly reproducible taxonomic structure
[SPEAKER_00]: consisting of this protobacteria,
actinobacteria, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for fungi, this is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just isolate too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it difficult to
discriminate between stochastic encounters
[SPEAKER_00]: and associations that have
eco-physiological relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to overcome that limitation is
that you sample over successive years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this illustrates you how we've done
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to discuss with you,
this is work that is now in revision,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, how we do those experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we isolated this fungus, which is
called colototrichum tofielde,
[SPEAKER_00]: from healthy asymptomatic plants in
natural Arabidopsis populations of the
[SPEAKER_00]: central plateau of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see these are four different
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really an endemic fungus in the
central plateau of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We examined habitats from Germany and
France, and we could not detect this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, it's really persistent over
consecutive years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one other reason why this fungus
attracted us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the pathologists may know
this, because almost all characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: colototrichum fungal species cause plant
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tofielde, these are some of its
cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cause diseases on fruits and
leaves and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, why is this fungus, is it capable
to engage in association with healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: asymptomatic plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something that we wanted to
understand in greater detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one important clue really came from a
closer look at the natural habitat where
[SPEAKER_00]: you find this fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know whether any one of you had
ever had the chance to visit the central
[SPEAKER_00]: plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a harsh environment,
and the soil is very low in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, it's low in phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these poor Arabidopsis plants,
they really have a hard time to survive in
[SPEAKER_00]: these Arabidopsis populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we thought is to better
characterize, sorry, I need to go back,
[SPEAKER_00]: to better characterize the system that we
again apply our reductionist approach that
[SPEAKER_00]: I explained to you before with a bacterial
microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this plant fungus interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we generated a transgenic GFP
expressing colototrichum tofielde.
[SPEAKER_00]: We inoculated it with the germ-free
Arabidopsis plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Arabidopsis plant expressing a
plasma membrane marker protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed this fungus really forms
dense extra radical hyphae surrounding
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take a cross section through a
root, this is really remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus ramifies within the root
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all fungal hyphae.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find them between Arabidopsis root
cells, but also inside root cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really extensive colonization of the
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without causing visible symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the lab, the plants stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of these habitat features and
the low nutrient conditions, we wondered
[SPEAKER_00]: what will happen if we grow Arabidopsis
under defined nutrient limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested phosphate nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are four week old Arabidopsis
plants grown under low phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, 50 micromolar.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this condition, Arabidopsis initiates
the phosphate starvation response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are stunted and there's reduced
shoot biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what happens when you add this
colototrichum tofielde.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots are elongated and there's an
increase in shoot biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can quantify the shoot fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mock control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you add the tofielde fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a growth promotion activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important control.
[SPEAKER_00]: He killed fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another important control.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we add the cousin of tofielde,
which is the pathogenic incarnum,
[SPEAKER_00]: root colonizing incarnum fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, of course, a reduction in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, under high phosphate
levels, so sufficient phosphate level,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you add the fungus, there's no increase
in shoot biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not only that this fungus
promotes Arabidopsis growth under low
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate, but it also increases the
fertility, so the reproductive fitness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can measure that simply by
counting the number of fruits of
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very clear there's an increase in
the fruit number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does this fungus promote
Arabidopsis growth under phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we took advantage of the
tools that have been developed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way how we conduct these
experiments, we grow Arabidopsis plants on
[SPEAKER_00]: these large agar plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside the agar plates, we place a
small petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the small petri dish, we add the
fungal spores and we add P33, so auto
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate, radioactively labeled auto
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens is the fungus growth
outside of this inner compartment
[SPEAKER_00]: establishes connectivities with the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measure radioactivity in the
shoots after three weeks of co-incubation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the results, the kilobacorel,
you know, per gram dry weight in
[SPEAKER_00]: individual plants is shown in this plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you agree with me that there is
really a remarkable amount of phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: that is transferred from the fungus via
the hyphae, via the roots to the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, if we now use the
pathogenic cousin of Coletotrichum
[SPEAKER_00]: tofieri, there is a very minor transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find even more remarkable,
under high phosphate conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: so phosphate sufficient amounts,
then this beneficial fungus tofieri cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer any longer phosphate to the
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this tells us is that the transfer
of phosphate is strictly regulated on
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate availability in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wondered, of course, what is the
genetic control of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned before that Arabidopsis in
all plants have developed a complex
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic system to monitor phosphate
availability and then to adjust growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to phosphate starvation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the phosphate starvation response
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wondered, you know, whether this
growth promotion that we see in wild type
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, whether that is dependent on these
genetic components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows you one result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the PHF1 gene that is actually
necessary to release phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: transporters from the ER to the plasma
membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look into that mutant,
clearly the plant growth promotion is
[SPEAKER_00]: impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find more interestingly,
if you now measure fungal biomass in this
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant only under low phosphate
conditions, then you see excessive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this very sophisticated beneficial
interaction is impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in the next step, we were
interested in examining at the transcript
[SPEAKER_00]: tome level changes, transcriptional
reprogramming induced by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for this purpose, we've carried out
time resolved RNA-seq experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noted that in Arabidopsis roots,
there's a large number of genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 16 pairwise comparisons,
very complex data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to pay your attention just to
this cluster of genes, cluster nine genes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are specifically upregulated in the
presence of sufficient amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate and in the presence of the
beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not upregulated in the
presence of the fungus and phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look, you know, what do these
genes encode?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are strongly enriched in genes that
are involved in innate immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks as if Arabidopsis activates
defense gene expression and innate immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to the fungus specifically only
in the presence of sufficient phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not under phosphate deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was one cluster of genes from
these cluster nine genes that attracted it
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically because these are genes that
encode for indole and tryptophan metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a particular reason for this
because several years ago, we had shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that this class of compounds and these
genes encode indole glucosinulates,
[SPEAKER_00]: a class of secondary metabolites in
Arabidopsis, that these confer potent
[SPEAKER_00]: immune responses to fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wondered what will happen if we
deplete Arabidopsis plants of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis of these secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that in Arabidopsis by
using a double mutant of these P450 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants in the absence of the
pathogens, they just grow like wild type
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you add the beneficial fungus,
it kills the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now in the absence of these compounds,
the beneficial colitrotrichum tofialidae
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus becomes a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what this tells us is that
these secondary metabolites that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed to have antibiotic functions
against pathogens, that they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: novel functions and they clearly are
necessary for the establishment of an
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with a beneficial root
associated fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's somewhat thought
provoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So end of data slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd like to zoom out and just like
to put this work a little bit into a
[SPEAKER_00]: broader context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what this slide really shows is
the increase of fertilizer consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed you that this beneficial
fungus really provides phosphate to its
[SPEAKER_00]: host and helps the plant to mobilize
phosphate from soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also clear that phosphate is just
one of the three nutrients that we use in
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic fertilizers next to nitrate and
to potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also clear that these synthetic
fertilizers help to feed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roughly 50% of the plant productivity is
due to the use of fertilizers and 50% is
[SPEAKER_00]: plant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess you will also agree with me
that the excessive use of fertilizers has
[SPEAKER_00]: detrimental effects on the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition, global sources for
phosphate in fertilizers are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this certainly fuels interests in
isolating novel bio-fertilizer microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant microbiota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but leaving apart this translational
aspect, I hope I've been able to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: you that really what plant microbiota
research is about, it's about studying
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions between soil, microbial
communities and plant genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this offers unique
possibility, creates new interfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: between disciplines of writing and of
science that are traditionally more
[SPEAKER_00]: separated, terrestrial microbiology,
plant science, geochemistry and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is really where we operate
and where I would like to extend our work
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next five, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see how long, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've come to the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most important slide is really to
acknowledge a fantastic underground group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've mentioned most of them in
passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should perhaps really give credit to the
computational scientists, Ruben Garidour
[SPEAKER_00]: or Geri Srinivas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, to our collaborator on the
leaf microbiota, Daniel Müller and Julia
[SPEAKER_00]: Vorholt from the ETH Zurich and a number
of funding agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a number of other
external collaborators, Alice McCarty,
[SPEAKER_00]: Julia Vorholt, I mentioned before,
Jeff Dengel, of course, Simona Ruddle-Poy
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cornelia Petersen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the manuscript, of course,
we shied away from any mechanistic
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, if you look into the
literature, Frank Desoe actually in the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has done experiments with GFP-tagged
rhizobia, where he had shown, inoculated
[SPEAKER_00]: them to rice roots and he had shown that
these rhizobia then over time can be
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered from above ground parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how they get there, whether they
make it via the transpiration stream or
[SPEAKER_00]: outside on the root surface, that is
entirely unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the other way, so from leaves
back to roots, I think this happens more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every rain shower will wash off
leaf-associated bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely possible that
leaf-associated bacteria makes it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and then recolonizes the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I think, really a connected
system of leaf and root-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, in this closed compartment
system in the calcine clay, we watered
[SPEAKER_00]: them initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make sure we water them at maximum
water retention capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to re-water them once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we open the magenta boxes on the clean
bench and then carefully add sterile water
[SPEAKER_00]: just to avoid any perturbation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, Ellen, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done those experiments because
we always feel that it is important to do
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in a whole organism context.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think somewhat similar experiments
have been done by Noah Fira here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he implanted organic carbon sources
into unplanted soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very clear that organic carbon is
the most important rate-limiting step for
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of soil-borne bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in unplanted soil, organic carbon is
always rate-limiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think one of our hypotheses
indeed is that this whole process of
[SPEAKER_00]: community establishment is initiated by
organic carbons that are released by root
[SPEAKER_00]: exudation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that initiates a substrate-driven
community establishment process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is hand-waving at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it becomes experimentally
tractable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these are really important
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I showed only a small part of
the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, it becomes a pathogen if
we deplete all of these branch pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, of course, also genetically
depleted this branch pathway, the Pantou
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you specifically impair the plant
growth promotion, but the plant is still
[SPEAKER_00]: doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one hypothesis is that actually these
metabolic products may have even a
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling role in growth promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know when we deplete chamelecin
production, there's no effect whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one interpretation is that these
secondary metabolites constrain the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: or limit the growth of the fungus to a
certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you deplete them, then there's
excessive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's consistent with the fact that
at least in the sub-79b2b3 mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, I think, six or seven-fold
increased fungal biomass compared to wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks as if the fungal colonization
is uncontrolled in the absence of these
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we've used, we've used a
reporter line for plasma membrane,
[SPEAKER_00]: marker protein, a chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can clearly see that the hyphae
that grow inside root cells are surrounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by a plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're quite confident about that.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're testing, of course, many,
many more mutants in this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think there's much more that can be
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I haven't done those experiments,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've taken, indeed, we've taken
cross-section through different regions of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see colonization really from,
yeah, from, almost from the root tip to
[SPEAKER_00]: highly differentiated roots, including
secondary growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's no, we cannot really
pinpoint at the moment a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental stage of the root where this
fungus would establish these associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is actually a disadvantage of
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's unlike in mycorrhizae where
you have these beautifully abuscles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is really, yeah,
the fungus is ramifying throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: root cortex and occasionally even makes it
into the central cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is really only on rare occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mainly found in the root cortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought if this were true,
it's too bad I don't have the slide with
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested Arabidopsis relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, Kadamene Hissuta,
which is a relative of Taliana,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Kadamene Hissuta is naturally lacks
the capacity for Camalexin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned before that if we
genetically impair Camalexin production in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis, we see retained growth
promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in Kadamene Hissuta, also this
fungus colonizes Arabidopsis and promotes
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we tested Capsular rubella,
Capsular rubella is one of the very few
[SPEAKER_00]: Brassicasia that has lost the capacity for
Indoglucosinulate production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Capsular rubella looks like a
CYP79B2B3 double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kills Capsular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is relevant because in Spain,
Capsular rubella and Arabidopsis taliana
[SPEAKER_00]: share the same habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of our hypothesis is that
these secondary metabolites are actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: host range determinant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, at least that's what the data
tell us so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is one of the central
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a minimum complexity community?
[SPEAKER_00]: What determines the taxonomic structure,
this highly reproducible taxonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course now having access to this
culture collection enables us to test
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have 206 root derived bacteria,
the number of combinations you can test is
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have some strategic plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: One possibility is you can deplete
particular taxonomic lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you take away the protobacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is you can take away the
bacteriodates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another possibility is it's realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can test in binary interactions,
interactions between the bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one route that we are pursuing
because we believe that antagonistic
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions, bacteria-bacteria
interactions, are very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: microbolta establishment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are ongoing, very important
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do experimental evolution in the lab
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use our culture collection and then
we apply a defined nutrient stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, low phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we incubate them with the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we isolate the synthetic community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we re-inoculate for a second
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are now, I think, at generation six
or generation seven on the host side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacterial, of course, these are
thousands and thousands of bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is really, I don't know
whether this will work, but that's one
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that you can apply experimental
evolution strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can test whether there is a
real-time evolution to support plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's something for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another, I think this is why we
tend to say in Cologne, we are facing the
[SPEAKER_00]: candy shop problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less, you can start so many things
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start too many things,
you can feel really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one needs to prioritize very,
very carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remind me again that... Yes,
yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we are now,
that's a project that we've started
[SPEAKER_00]: actually in a collaboration with Sheng Yan
He, not far from here, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now, we do barcoding of our bacterial
culture collection with a TN7.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barcode them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can add, because the
fundamental question about resilience of
[SPEAKER_00]: the community is... I think the major
function of a community is that it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the sum of the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are emergent properties that you
cannot explain on the basis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a very popular theory in
ecology is that a community, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: community of organism, is resistant to
invasion of alien members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do now with our barcoded
root-derived bacteria, that we add them to
[SPEAKER_00]: a preformed root microbiota of plants
grown in different soil types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can test their invasion and
persistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this is a very rare event that
really a bacterium can intrude,
[SPEAKER_00]: can make it into a preformed community.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molecular basis of this, I think that
is, again, it's years of research ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly something that is of
fundamental importance to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's in part, it's already
during establishment of these bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that these bacteria must be
competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must out-compete all of their
competitors that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zillions and zillions of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they must have a very high
competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, again, very important
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, now we have, as I tried to
explain, our core culture collections and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the whole genome sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to infer functions of the
microbiota is you use metagenomic
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a major limitation of metagenomic
approaches is that only 20 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences could actually be annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we use our whole genome
sequences, it looks like as if,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the number of genes that we can
annotate on the basis of metagenome
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches is really dramatically
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I hope that with the whole
genome sequences that our future
[SPEAKER_00]: metagenome approaches will become more
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also believe that or at least one
hypothesis is that the adaptation or the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional adaptation is not in the core
genome, but it's in the accessory or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pan genome of these bacterial
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may explain why we have this
highly reproducible taxonomic structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And irrespective of whether we grow,
you know, plants, you know, in the US or
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe or in Asia or whatsoever,
we always end up with the same taxonomic
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, looking at the whole genome
level, there may be signals of
[SPEAKER_00]: biogeography and there may be adaptations
to particular environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my hypothesis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, again, it's a long term question
that I think through increased
[SPEAKER_00]: availability of whole genome sequences and
hopefully many, many more systematic
[SPEAKER_00]: culture collections, we can address this
systematically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This
[SPEAKER_03]: has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
