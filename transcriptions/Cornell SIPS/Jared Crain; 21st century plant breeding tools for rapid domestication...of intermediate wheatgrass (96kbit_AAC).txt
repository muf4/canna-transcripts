[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to acknowledge that I'm getting
to share the work today here, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of other collaborators, PIs,
that have helped bring this work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it definitely doesn't happen alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of the people that I'll
mention today, Dr. Steve Larson is a USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: research scientist at Logan, Utah,
Dr. Jesse Poland, started some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: work when he was at Kansas State and is
still a collaborative on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dr. Lita Hahn is the breeder for
the intermediate wheatgrass at the Land
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he does a lot of the hands-on field
work, providing the data that I get to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze and work with and show you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the talk for today just really,
four different parts provide a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of introduction for intermediate
wheatgrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it is, what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll spend most of the time on
this breeding for crop development,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the intermediate wheatgrass
breeding cycle and some of the results
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, conclude kind of with some
population genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do with the data and where
we're trying to go in the future with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing, and I know there is
actually research at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_01]: with Thinopyrum intermediate, but most of
the time, most audiences, the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is just, what is this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's intermediate wheatgrass,
so Thinopyrum intermedium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grain is being marketed under the name
Kernza.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually use IWG, but if I say Kernza,
we're talking about the same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grain there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a perennial plant that we're
looking at a neo-domestication for
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like reduced nitrate leaching,
reduced soil erosion, increased carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: capture that you can do with these
perennial root systems compared to our
[SPEAKER_01]: annual crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just looking a little bit at what do
you do with this grain, some different
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patagonia has released this long root ale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this one is on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if Patagonia has released an
East Coast version of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cascadian Farms, so a subsidiary of
General Mills, one of the largest cereal
[SPEAKER_01]: makers, released this limited edition
cereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of small scale breweries,
bakeries are making products.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Pennsylvania, there's Columbia County
bread and granola making these sprouted
[SPEAKER_01]: Kernza crisp or little chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different utilization
of the grain, everything from breads to
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at where all of this started,
just to get a brief timeline, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1980s, a lot of the ideas started at the
Rodale Institute in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: They evaluated over 150 different
perennial species looking for what they
[SPEAKER_01]: thought was the main target that could be
more easily domesticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And intermediate was the chosen species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2003, that work moved to the Land
Institute with Lee DeHaan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Lee completed about six breeding
cycles from 2003 up to 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2017 is when we started genomic
selection up to today, going from cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: seven this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're in breeding cycle 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at breeding intermediate
wheatgrass, the four big traits we look
[SPEAKER_01]: at, non-shattering, free-threshing seed,
seed size or seed mass, and then grain
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, intermediate's about 10% of
annual wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really needs to be increased to be
a viable crop for farmers to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as breeding, it isn't actually an
out-crossing heterozygous perennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genome is a little bit smaller than
bread wheat, but it's still 12.6 GB,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also a perennial as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before genomic selection, the
traditional phenotypic breeding cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: would look a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would take your parents in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could cross those, intermate those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would get seed off your parent plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fall, you could start seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the summer of year number two,
you would collect phenotypic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd take that phenotypic data back,
analyze it, and go figure out which plants
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted to bring back in and make your
next cycle of selection with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this takes, at a minimum, two full
years per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one equation we'll really look at
today is just rate of genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to look at it with
letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to get into numbers or
calculating, but just in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know that rate of genetic gain is the
intensity of selection, the accuracy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the genetic variation, all divided by the
time to complete the breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this example, it takes us two years
to complete the breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a perennial plant, maybe we want to
know how does that plant respond in years
[SPEAKER_01]: two and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to do those evaluations,
then it just adds more time to the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding cycle, driving your genetic gain
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first three cycles at the Land
Institute were three years per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how, from 2003 to 2010,
to 2016, there were only six cycles of
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started this work really in fall of
2016, looking at how do we implement
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my task as a postdoc,
is we want to implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of the schematic we came up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks a lot like your phenotypic
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting out, you can cross your parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get seed off of those parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the fall, when you start those
individual seedlings, those get tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: sampled, genotyped, and we can predict
right away on those seedlings that are
[SPEAKER_01]: only a couple weeks old which ones we
think are going to have the best trait
[SPEAKER_01]: values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we start about 4,000 seedlings,
100 are selected each year for parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go in and grab those 100 that
you want for parents, move them to the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, and right away they can be
intermated, forming seed for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there is a second component with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can complete the breeding cycle,
but we want our genomic selection model to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep being updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second part is we take the
non-selected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take those out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be evaluated the second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third year, and all of that data can
go back into forming the predictions for
[SPEAKER_01]: the following cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our training population is always at
least one cycle behind what we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But following this scheme, you can get
your breeder's equation, the rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic gain, just down to the intensity,
the selection accuracy, and genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: variance because we're down to one year
per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about how this works,
again, just the breeder's equation,
[SPEAKER_01]: those various components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under phenotypic selection, we can vary
each part of this equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one area that we work on is selection
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under phenotypic selection, Lee would plan
out 10,000 plants and then select the best
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an eye value.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an eye value of 2.65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under genomic selection, just based on
cost constraints, we only genotype about
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000, and we still select about 100 for
the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our eye value is 2.38.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, when we look at genomic
selection to phenotypic selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at 0.87.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not actually selecting as hard on
the population with genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we are under phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's selection intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our big gain is in selection
accuracy, where we complete that breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle in half the time, which should give
us essentially double the gain compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can simulate this and all of these
different variables, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity and time, that's the two things
that we can really manipulate with genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can put together kind of a curve of
where we think we can end up for
[SPEAKER_01]: particular traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on this figure, the time axis,
that's the genomic selection divided by
[SPEAKER_01]: the, excuse me, phenotypic divided by
genomic selection time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the last slide, we were at 0.05.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were at half the time of phenotypic
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The y-axis is intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this particular case, we were at
0.89.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our relative efficiency or
relative gain of genomic selection to
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic selection is where we are on
this response surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using the values from the last slide,
and this trait is for just grain yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: spike yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our selection intensity is a little bit
lower under genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're still doing that in half the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should get to about a two and a half
time, two and a half relative efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: gain using genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do look, this response curve
actually doesn't set directly on this
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming from a little bit of
gain in accuracy I've used as just a fixed
[SPEAKER_01]: variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we have our genetic markers,
when we're making our field adjustments,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can actually make a better prediction
of that plot than we could with pedigree
[SPEAKER_01]: records alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we get a little bit coming
off of the main line there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do this with each trait,
looking at different hair abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is basically what we put
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought for free threshing,
we could get a relative gain of three,
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.8 times our phenotypic selection,
something that's highly heritable,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spike yield, this is one of our
lower heritability traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is affecting spike yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still get about two and a half times the
relative gain compared to phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that work, that was kind of the
setup to move toward genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a training population that had been
phenotyped and genotyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the slides before, the data was
built on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew what our trait hair abilities
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we went to application and how did
we apply this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just the overview of the
breeding cycle, getting that entire cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: into one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually think the breeding cycle
starting in about October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is at the point that we've
selected those parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those seedlings are growing bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have multiple ramets of each
individual genet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by genet, I mean a plant that is a
single plant with a genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one single heterozygous plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could clone that genet into multiple
ramets where each ramet is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the greenhouse, these ramets,
they're cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're vernalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're intermated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then around April to May, all of these
breeding populations, you can thresh the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the seed for the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second part, again, is keeping that
training population up updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time that the greenhouse work
is going on, the validation or the
[SPEAKER_01]: training population is out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's being vernalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overwintering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the summer, starting in May to
July, all of the phenotypic data can be
[SPEAKER_01]: collected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final aspect, what I work on
particularly, is the genomic selection and
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction, which occurs from about the
1st of August to the 1st of October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just zooming in on that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the top, we have August at the far
end, October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the basic steps of the
breeding program, everything that has to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the number of days
approximately that each one of these steps
[SPEAKER_01]: takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time that the data is still
being recorded, it's still being compiled
[SPEAKER_01]: and checked, this is going on until
mid-August.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seedlings are already started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get all of the data, Lee DeHaan is
handling all of this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's a pass off to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we start running it through our
statistical models, trying to get the best
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction as a training population to
predict on those new seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tissue collection on about 4,000 plants
over a couple, about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have two weeks or so to do GBS
library preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those are sent off to a sequencing
center, two to three weeks later,
[SPEAKER_01]: we get data back, a lot of quality
control, check in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we call SNPs, impute the
data, we're ready for the genomic
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I like to describe it,
the genomic predictions, that's my one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I have to do each year,
and it's only one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work one day a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is nothing can go wrong
about one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spend the rest of the time making
sure one day is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those predictions are made,
I pass all that data back to Lee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at the end, like I said,
it's a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't handle the entire process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have things divided up with
what we can do very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he uses the breeder's eye and
makes selection indices and selects those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that go into the greenhouse for
mating and updating the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started this, we did publish this
in the Plant Genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the graph we published.
[SPEAKER_01]: So TLI cycle six, this was the last year
of phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then starting in 2017, we had cycle
seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was published in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've updated the figure a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2023, we've got the third year of data
from cycle 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, this is a little bit out
of date.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is today's breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same thing we saw on the last
slide, we've already got cycle 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last year of data is just collected a
couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then starting this year, we've moved
to a rapid cycling to get two cycles per
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're at cycle 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: We completed that back in March and we're
working on cycle 14 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has really allowed us to move
instead of discrete generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle six and then planting cycle seven
for one, two or three years and then cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go through multiple generations and
we also have multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're never at the same plant age,
but within one calendar year, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring multiple generations,
how that plant's responding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have hope that in some evidence that
we think this is making our prediction
[SPEAKER_01]: models better, that we're doing better at
incorporating all the G by E elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned speed breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the timeline sets up much the
same way, only the breeding population,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really condensed that under red and
far infrared light, we can grow these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and get them to tiller in about
three weeks after putting a lot of red
[SPEAKER_01]: light on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can start in October like the
normal breeding cycle, by February
[SPEAKER_01]: threshing seed, by mid-March, the
selections have been made and now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up on completing that cycle again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just about 10 days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Land Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is cycle 14, the entire breeding
cycle that's been started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And genotyped, there's Lee and Sussell
Staffett is a postdoc with the Land
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the very end, I'll share some of the
work that he's been leading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the far red lights that
we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get data back, those plants will
go under right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two cycles per year, this is the
proximate timeline we're following.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our first year, but it looks like
we're on track to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time that cycles are
advancing in the greenhouse, we still have
[SPEAKER_01]: the training population growing in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's multiple moving parts at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the implementation of genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other part of my job then is
convincing the breeder that what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've spent a lot of time looking at
different measures and how can we tell if
[SPEAKER_01]: our selections are working or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things we did was we
had this predicted value on the seedling,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we had the training population,
about a thousand plants that go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, okay, how well does this
predicted value actually measure the field
[SPEAKER_01]: data that was measured seven, eight months
later?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is free threshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cycle seven, on the X axis is the
predicted value that we made in the fall
[SPEAKER_01]: of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Y axis is the observed value
from the field in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is year one, we get a correlation
of 0.76 at multiple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the same cycle, same plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using the same predicted value that
we made, but in year number two,
[SPEAKER_01]: so in 2019, so almost two full years after
we'd made that prediction, we still get a
[SPEAKER_01]: very strong correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is free threshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably have the better results for
free threshing shattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the lower results is spike yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're trying to increase yield,
a lot of emphasis here, the correlation is
[SPEAKER_01]: only 0.25.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in year one, and then in year two,
again, using our predicted value,
[SPEAKER_01]: predicted value from 2017 and seeing how
it looked in 2019, a correlation of 0.21,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is low, but there's still a trend
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that we looked at then was
we had these hundred parents that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: intermated, had been selected ideally as
the best individuals to move that
[SPEAKER_01]: population parameters forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the same generation, a thousand of
those plants that were not selected as
[SPEAKER_01]: parents went out to the field,
they are training model.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since it's a perennial plant,
once these plants, the parents were
[SPEAKER_01]: intermated in the greenhouse, they were
still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was an idea, okay, let's put
those parents out beside the unselected of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're seeing here is a
histogram of a free threshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in at least the second year,
because the first year those parents are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the greenhouse, then they've been
planted right beside the same field.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some statistical issues,
the parents aren't randomized,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ideally the better parents are on the
edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for free threshing, if we make a
histogram of the entire population,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the black bars, the mean of the
population is the vertical black bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at this, those hundred
parents, those have been colored in in
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mean of the parent population for free
threshing ends up being about 11% on a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage scale higher free threshing
than the unselected individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can look at the same traits of
spike yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, there wasn't a strong
correlation between predicted value and
[SPEAKER_01]: observed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we take those parents out to the
field, again, we find that our parent
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are outperforming the unselected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just giving some data that we do feel
like our models are working, so confidence
[SPEAKER_01]: in what we're predicting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at other traits, so this is
summarizing in a table the same type of
[SPEAKER_01]: things we saw in that histogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have the trait, the realized
selection differential, how those parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mean value of the parents versus the
mean value of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using the heritability,
we can estimate the expected response to
[SPEAKER_01]: selection and percent genetic gain per
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for free threshing, and this is one
that we saw the histogram on, the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: were about 11 percentage points better
than the unselected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends up being about a 14% per year
genetic gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spike yield, the parents were 0.11 grams
better, but we had a lower heritability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our estimated or expected response is
only about 0.04 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: That still ends up being about 8% genetic
gain per year for free threshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the first things we
looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're up to multiple cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look at the field data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a common garden experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just looking at how those cycles
individually are performing and predicting
[SPEAKER_01]: the best, the blup for each individual,
sorting those into the cycle they came
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the X axis, we have the different
cycles starting at cycle six, all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to cycle 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the distribution of those
individuals for spike yield in grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a nice trend upward, which is in
this case, across five cycles,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 7% percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see the big four traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had spike yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is seed mass, about 3% per
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say this is the trait that's
probably had the least selection of the
[SPEAKER_01]: four important traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This had the least selection emphasis on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Percent free threshing, about 11% per
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the last two cycles, I know that Lee
has decreased that selection intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: because we are getting a lot of plants
that are 90% free threshing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So changing focus to other variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, less shattering is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a nice downward trend across
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've looked really at setting up the
genomic selection pipeline and then
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating that pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last little bit that I want to talk
about is, once we have a program where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is genotyped, everything is
phenotype, what all can we do with that
[SPEAKER_01]: data?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the first things is genome-wide
association studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data I'll share is on TLI cycles
six through nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, if I were to go do this,
I would have cycles six through 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about 1,000 plants per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're up to, the data I'll show is on
about 4,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, that database, that snowball keeps
rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up to about 8,000 phenotyped and
genotyped plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the data is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go into a GWAS very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Manhattan plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For seed shattering, we find some
significant peaks, 2S and 4S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, the percent variance
explained by each one of these peaks are
[SPEAKER_01]: very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at those 4,000 plants,
I don't know if we had a GWAS peak that
[SPEAKER_01]: explained more than 3% of the variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we have multiple breeding cycles,
then we can go back and say, how is this
[SPEAKER_01]: allele frequency changing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little bit more validation
that our GS is working as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this first box plot, this is for
shattering on that 4S marker once we ran
[SPEAKER_01]: the GWAS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we estimated the allele effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very additive being heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have yet to see a very strong heterotic
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our traits respond very
additively.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the higher the score,
the higher the shattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to actually be low here with
this C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can put together, based on the
reference genome, how this allele
[SPEAKER_01]: frequency changed in the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would like to see more of the SNP C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then starting in cycle six,
the C is in the alternate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases from about 0.25% over 0.6%
over those three cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was strictly based on the genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we ran the GWAS, we didn't know that
this marker was associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: shattering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't selecting on it other than just
being a product of the genomic selection
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another trait, brittle rachis,
we do find really strong peaks on 3J.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a case I like to show all the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we see a very nice additive allele
effect where the lower the score,
[SPEAKER_01]: the less shattering and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we look, so we'd like to see more
of the T SNP, we actually see that
[SPEAKER_01]: decreasing in the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing we can think of is that
this particular region has some linkage
[SPEAKER_01]: drag or something that even with our GS
models, we're not prioritizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular SNP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd mentioned that our percent
variance explained was very small for all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just using some quantitative formulas,
you can estimate the number of QTL that
[SPEAKER_01]: are controlling things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within intermediate, so we looked at
brittle rachis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have been able to find a QTL
that explained 0.9% of the variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that, there's maybe 166 QTL
controlling brittle rachis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is very interesting, especially
for the small grains with barley that
[SPEAKER_01]: brittle rachis is a very well studied
system, the BTR1, the BTR2 gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: and brittle rachis is solved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on our analytical data, we don't see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the empirical data in the field,
we don't have any main effect QTL.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that there are a lot of copy
numbers of this BTR gene, how they are
[SPEAKER_01]: interacting, how they are working,
not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this number wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the real number will
ever be, but it's definitely not a one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two or even a couple gene system that is
often associated with brittle rachis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the small grains like barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this slide, what I want to show
with this is we've got this big data set,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got stuff that's genotype,
we've got phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just asking questions of
the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular data set, the NPGS
germplasm collection was genotype,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have pretty good historical
records.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the Kernza breeding program since
the 1980s, but we don't know which PIs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would have been the PIs that were
used to start the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just said, okay, can we identify
from molecular data where the founders of
[SPEAKER_01]: the current Kernza breeding population
are?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a map just of the Black Sea,
Caspian Sea, and then there's three
[SPEAKER_01]: different color codes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The orange circles are areas, are PIs that
molecular data predicted to be the founder
[SPEAKER_01]: of Kernza, and historical data had
documented as the founders of Kernza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that the historical data is
very clear that they selected 20 sessions
[SPEAKER_01]: for intermating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that's the end of the
historical records.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have which 20 sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've recreated that based on the data
from 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a lot of overlap right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple triangles are PIs that
molecular data suggested was the founders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the green triangles, or excuse
me, green diamonds are sessions that we
[SPEAKER_01]: estimated from the historical record.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, there's a lot of concurrence,
especially right here in this Russia
[SPEAKER_01]: region between the Black Sea and Caspian
Sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's the Stavropol, I hope I
said that correct region, that most of our
[SPEAKER_01]: Kernza varieties come from that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thing, just the future,
where are we going with some of this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the next big thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this might, I don't know if some of
Jesse's talk last week might've mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this, but SCIM sequencing,
high throughput, SCIM sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're trying to do is move our marker
platform away from GBS to something that
[SPEAKER_01]: will scale with the new systems and also
avoids any proprietary issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was done, Jesse was the lead PI on
this using very low SCIM sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think 0.05x coverage to identify
introgressions into wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that worked really well to identify
introgressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at these two systems,
I just put this together, moving when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start thinking about whole genome
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the intermediates been on GBS,
we get 1,000 to 2,000 chromosome per
[SPEAKER_01]: markers, 30 to 40,000 genome wide with
TASL pipeline, very easy to analyze the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have lots of missing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the predictions that I showed
were made with up to 70% missing data per
[SPEAKER_01]: marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: With SCIM sequencing, we've went from a
reduced representation to a whole genome
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at 0.05x coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gets us down to an affordable
level to sequence in the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are no duplicate reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most reads are a single read,
but across populations we can get three to
[SPEAKER_01]: 4 million variants per chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went from working on 40,000 markers
up to like 80 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put this together, I didn't know how
else to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now it's a different set of
software, one piece for filtering,
[SPEAKER_01]: one piece for doing the next analysis and
pipelining all that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would say we've got even more
missing data than GBS if we thought we had
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of missing data under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the last couple of weeks,
and Sussell Staffett, the postdoc at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Land Institute has been working on a lot
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really helped move this forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last couple of weeks, I feel like
we've kind of had a breakthrough on moving
[SPEAKER_01]: toward this method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to show, so this is a GWAS
peak, or excuse me, Manhattan plot for
[SPEAKER_01]: brittle rachis on that chromosome 3G,
3J using GBS markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had about 2000 markers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have really good peaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 120 million base pairs,
160, and those correspond.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that the BTR genes are right in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking the SCIMSEQ data, just that
alone, .05x coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another analysis of brittle
rachis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually start to see really good peaks
that are lining up with our GBS markers
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe even a little bit cleaner
resolution throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of these areas, this is the 120,
160, 280, we have found through GWAS GBS
[SPEAKER_01]: markers in those spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really promising that I think
that we can make this work as a way
[SPEAKER_01]: forward for affordable sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll have a lot more data for
different analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in summary, with genomic
selection, we can really decrease our
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In intermediate wheatgrass, all of our
traits are really polygenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see any major effect QTLs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using all that data, we can do a lot
of different analysis, even analysis that
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't start out to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just got a huge data set that a lot
of times we can answer a question if we
[SPEAKER_01]: parse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, breeding programs just
require teams of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: My part's been the bioinformatics,
the data management, and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic data has came from lead on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, again, I'd like to thank a
lot of fundings came from the Land
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute, Malone Family Land Preservation
Foundation, and the FFA AR program as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure I've missed people,
but it takes a lot of people to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: present that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to acknowledge all of their
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the correlation between spike yield
and yield per unit area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, did you look at inbreeding question?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the question is correlation between
spike yield on a single plant and what
[SPEAKER_01]: would be more like a plot what a farmer
would harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lee had did a lot of work on this 2005,
2010, looking at single plants versus
[SPEAKER_01]: plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why he initially started with
single plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are moving to a lot more half-sib
family evaluation, so full plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've kind of tweaked what I've shown
there to where now we can plant a full
[SPEAKER_01]: half-sib family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually probably in the future
going to be more informative in our GS
[SPEAKER_01]: models than the single plant work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really have exact numbers,
but I know every time I've heard Lee talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, he says the correlation was high
enough that he felt comfortable going to
[SPEAKER_01]: single plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have not estimated particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can tell that the later cycles
are more inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we make our genomic relationship
matrix, I don't have a value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But across 25,000 markers in five or six
generations, only less than 300 have been
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed in the population.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we thought it'd be less improved
from the crop wild roll units than most
[SPEAKER_04]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, halving from prediction models in
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that even tossed around to estimate
values on the stuff in Korea and estimated
[SPEAKER_04]: on the PIs or from other sections?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where does that seem to come out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we have the blops or the
predictions, predicted values on
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate, have we tried to predict
back to what's in Grin?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've looked a lot of the wild accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 400 total in NPGS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know occasionally, and it's been a
couple of years, Lee will bring in some
[SPEAKER_01]: new material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, we've had enough genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a ton of diversity that we
really haven't pulled stuff in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have evaluated some.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the NPGS collection, there's definitely
different groups because intermediate
[SPEAKER_01]: wheatgrass was bred also prior to this as
a forage erosion control crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's differences in biomass
production versus seed production even
[SPEAKER_01]: within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the selected parents then do go back to
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really used them because they're
actually cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do a lot of checks like the
histograms I was showing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see that a lot, that the parents
are usually performing better in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the clonal data, I haven't used
that particularly in the models.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a chance that could
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a spatial correction with AR1 by
AR1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know for grain yield, if we stack
all of the parents on the side,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of being randomly allocated,
we're going to bias our model too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the selected parents, if nothing
else, the following year, the following
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, 1,000 plants are going to go into
the field, which should capture everything
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could be losing a little bit,
but we're going to be picking it up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next cycle anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many cycles of selection depends on
where the end goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a product that farmers could grow,
I mean, the University of Minnesota has
[SPEAKER_01]: released a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're coming out with their
second release.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at targeting, say,
an annual wheat yield, so the equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, whether you grew the perennial or
annual, I think the last estimates we were
[SPEAKER_01]: at were about 20 years of 47 cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that also assumes that the rate of
genetic gain is going to be constant every
[SPEAKER_01]: year, that we don't get too inbred or lose
too much diversity as well, which at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point, we haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But predicting out 20 years is
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our genomic selection is working,
but our GWAS is less than optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the only thing we know is we think
most traits are just highly, highly
[SPEAKER_01]: polygenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're looking at very small trait
effects, where our GS model just captures
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that and isn't trying to test for
significance of a single marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the GWAS was about 4,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was the training population across
five cycles of selection, so data
[SPEAKER_01]: representing about six or seven calendar
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pooled, so multiple years of
observation in the model, and then one
[SPEAKER_01]: blup per genet, per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each plant kept genotype separately and
had its unique predicted blup that went in
[SPEAKER_01]: the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had about 4,000 plants go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those blups, depending on the
cycle, would have either had one up to
[SPEAKER_01]: four years of observations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do know the maternal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the 100 selected, the breeding
program is the pots are growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, turn the fans on, and blow a
big pollen cloud of those 100 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: shuffle them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't do any targeted crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we also, using the GBS markers,
we can assign paternity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do track the pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pedigree, and I know selections,
we try to keep too many of the same family
[SPEAKER_01]: or maternal line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't optimal contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do try to, at least at a baseline
level, keep everything from coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: one family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know Lee has said before,
so this was TLI cycle six and before,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was using basically pedigree breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, the top lines would
all come out of the same family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do with the markers, we do get
better resolution than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost wise, as far as the genotyping,
say genomic selection prediction per
[SPEAKER_01]: sample is about probably total $10 or
less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're genotyping 4,000 to 4,400
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's $40,000 to $50,000 per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the genomic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not counting the labor and the
greenhouse work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay away from that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total cost would be very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And intermediate also, the identification
of intermediate, it started leaps and
[SPEAKER_01]: bounds ahead of many wild species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the Rodel Institute evaluated 150
different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they selected intermediate as the one
that was closest to being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: domesticate her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say closest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also think maybe the easiest if
we fix a few things and it already has a
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also going to depend on where that
species is starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many things do you have to fix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, in the NPGS sessions and
the ones that were coming out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: Russia region, some of those are marked
down as cultivar, or as a cultivated
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any more records than that,
exactly what that means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether there was been humor or human
intervention in the past, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say intermediate started
closer to a crop than some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: species that have been evaluated and
worked on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're contemplating changing market
platforms, right, from DPS to sequencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you planning on, so you're going
to have this sort of disconnect between
[SPEAKER_04]: your historical data and key data during
market reputation or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last slide I showed where the GWAS
is starting to look good, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first hurdle was making sure that we
thought our imputations were good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally, we had planned on this cycle
being to skim seek, but that is the hurdle
[SPEAKER_01]: is for that previous training population,
six generations, imputing those GBS
[SPEAKER_01]: markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically a whole genome
imputation just using those markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's still the work in progress
that's been kind of our holdup in moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to take all of the historical
data and impute it up to potentially both
[SPEAKER_04]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it will work in practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know, like Steve Larson, his group is
breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually starting his first
cycles of selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's starting with like a fresh
whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I showed with skim seek there is
all he needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's starting with that,
and he's off to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changing platforms is a challenge for any
program, but for this especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
