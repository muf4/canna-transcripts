[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you very much for Kelly's
invitation and Joss's introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because I had some misunderstanding,
I thought like the four of us will share
[SPEAKER_01]: the total eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to make my slides as compact as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only three slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the format we use for our
science lighting talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only three minutes, three slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to bring you to a totally
different scale from the previous two
[SPEAKER_01]: speakers and also last speaker by Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lab, our scale was actually very large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I usually start my talk from this
two dimension scale, in space and in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in space, we start from leaf scale all
the way to the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time scale, our research ranges
from hourly all the way to the decadal
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research program, we try to answer two
fundamental questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we try to understand how the
natural ecosystems and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural systems respond and feedback
to the climate change and climate
[SPEAKER_01]: variability and how they respond to
anthropogenic activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the scale is a major theme in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, the second question I want to
answer is like, how can we harness the
[SPEAKER_01]: best sensing technology to monitor the
interactions of these agriculture systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: natural systems with the climate change
and the anthropogenic activities?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how we can utilize the state of art
models, process-based models, to predict
[SPEAKER_01]: such interaction and feedbacks in order to
inform policy making.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in the blue font, I tried to
highlight some of those projects that we
[SPEAKER_01]: conducted under these two major themes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the research are funded by DOE,
USAID, SFUSDA, and SIDA, and also Cornell,
[SPEAKER_01]: Atkinson, and also the six grand
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major two approaches, number one,
we try to use the remote sensing
[SPEAKER_01]: observations, mostly from satellites,
but we also utilize onboard remote sensing
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the tower-based sensing
technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, I try to give you this example
showing this latest fleet of NASA
[SPEAKER_01]: satellites all the way from 1970s to
beyond the 2030s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we utilize different types of
observations starting from including
[SPEAKER_01]: optical remote sensing, thermal remote
sensing, microbial remote sensing,
[SPEAKER_01]: lidar remote sensing, and also gravity
remote sensing to really reveal different
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of the Earth's system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, the soil moisture,
vegetation health, and also water
[SPEAKER_01]: availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you a few examples
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second approach we use is called
process-based model.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one example is the Earth's model or
climate model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So such models have been utilized for the
IPCC climate report every few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we use such models because it can
help us understand the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we try to put the
mechanistic understanding into
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematical equations and put into these
type of models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So such models have different components
including land components, ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: component, atmospheric components,
and also ice sheet, everything put
[SPEAKER_01]: together so that we can utilize such
models to simulate the past and also
[SPEAKER_01]: simulate the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, this is one example of one
typical figure, which is the output of
[SPEAKER_01]: such models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, these models can simulate the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the past, where it overlapped
with the remote sensing technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: these data sets can be utilized to
benchmark such model simulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we gain confidence of such model
simulations, we can utilize these models
[SPEAKER_01]: to project the future to see, okay,
under different economic or sewage
[SPEAKER_01]: emission scenarios, what's it going to
look like for the land system and also for
[SPEAKER_01]: the atmospheric system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also ocean system, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, my lab focused on, again,
the terrestrial ecosystems and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two major geospatial tools we
use in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, on top of that, we also put AI
to enhance the capability of these tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then here, I'm going to give you some
specific examples of the research
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to divide them into these
metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one dimension is the field skill
versus original skills and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another dimension is what tools we use,
including both observations and also
[SPEAKER_01]: process-based models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the field skill, we try to develop
sensing technology and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: observational data to monitor crop growth
and dynamics governed by the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, these two figures, the left one
shows these two coupled tower systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: put the eddy currents measuring carbon,
water, and energy fluxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also another system that monitors the
hyperspectral and also chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescence measurements so that we
harness the two measurements to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the vegetation health and their response
to different management, including
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation, nitrogen management,
and also different stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, we also develop the drone
technologies that can put the concurrent
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement of hyperspectral and also
fluorescence measurements that can really
[SPEAKER_01]: look at many different targets,
including different management treatments
[SPEAKER_01]: and also breeding plots to look at their
different functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the regional skill, we utilize really
many different types of satellite data to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor and assess the food, water,
climate sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both Africa and China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first example shows, the left
figure shows, okay, the two decades of
[SPEAKER_01]: depletion, huge water depletion in North
and Western China.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a mystery of what was the
causes for such a long-term depletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at these gravity data set,
which give you information on total water
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, we look at the land
use, land cover change data set,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the soil moisture and also
evapotranspiration data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, we found it was really the
crop expansion because of cotton growth
[SPEAKER_01]: that has dramatically expanded in the past
couple of decades that led to this huge
[SPEAKER_01]: depletion of water, the total water
storage, because this is a very dry area
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cotton system really depends on
the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's very dry, there's no
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water should really come from the
groundwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where the groundwater come from,
that's from the glacier melting from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Tianshan Mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very complex system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we try to use the satellite data
set to really reveal what's exactly going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another example is like, we try to
utilize, again, different satellite data
[SPEAKER_01]: set to understand the impact of land
restoration program in Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has been a million, multi-million
dollar investment from Ethiopia to put
[SPEAKER_01]: different, the land restoration programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, we don't know what is the
large-scale national scale impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we utilize different satellite data set
to evaluate, okay, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity on the drought?
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out that such restoration program
can actually improve the drought
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration for productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So such analysis can be done by the
conventional approaches with very
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated surveys that are
labor-intensive and very time-consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also at the field scale, we utilize
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the collaboration with Mike
Gore and Kelly Robbins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to harness multiple remote
sensing technologies and crop growth
[SPEAKER_01]: models and also AI to inform crop
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my students were trying to run
very sophisticated 3D radio transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: models that benchmarked by the LiDAR
measurement to see what is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal core structure that will have the
best productivity for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, we utilize both models and
remote sensing data to look at the future
[SPEAKER_01]: crop yield, the productivity, and also how
the agricultural revolution can impact the
[SPEAKER_01]: global carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one project we are in collaboration
with the NCAR, which is Natural Center for
[SPEAKER_01]: Atmospheric Research, trying to
understand, okay, what is the past driver,
[SPEAKER_01]: the green revolution, including the
fertilizer and the genetics can impact the
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 amplitude increase over the past five
decades, which has been a mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are a few projects I want to
highlight, but in the meantime,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll also work a lot on natural
vegetation, including apps on the Congo
[SPEAKER_01]: rainforest and also the carbon and water
coupling across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe Kelly can also chime in.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we try to the data set we
collected, including LiDAR data that's led
[SPEAKER_01]: by my course group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also the multispectral
measurement from UAV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LiDAR data was from like rovers and
also multispectral that's from UAV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have some fluorescence data
sets that is measured by UAV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kelly and I just got this SIPPS Grand
Challenge proposal that we want to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: more data in the G2F field in Musgrave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, this is like AI-based
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the phenotypical data also,
we are looking at a lot of the tracing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the latent space, which probably we don't
know what they are, but we other like more
[SPEAKER_01]: explicit tracing includes say planar
height, LAI, leaf angles, or those of
[SPEAKER_01]: course yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these different information,
but we're still looking at the data sets
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we're interested in like how
you are trying to optimize the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: structure to get the maximized
productivity of apples.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in advancing this, what are the
bottlenecks, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the imaging, the satellites,
is it the compute power, is it the number
[SPEAKER_06]: of people, the models, is it the ground
truth in the data sets, or is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question and a very hard to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, to me, bottlenecks are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the sensing technology part,
I think the data uncertainty is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really huge, especially for satellite and
remote sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of course we do have a lot of data
sets, but we don't know the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: certainties and how to trace those
uncertainties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we have been working
very hard on to trace those uncertainties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can really link the satellite
sensing signal with the actual variable or
[SPEAKER_01]: trace of our interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the ground remote sensing,
I think we're bottlenecked by the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of ground labels we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's quite hard to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another challenge probably with
analytical tools, like what is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: way to really harness the process-based
models and also AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are talking about we
should create knowledge-based engineering,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are a lot of different ways on
how to do that in the best way and most
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, once we use the deep learning
on AI, the computational power is always a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the challenge is
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any thanks here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one slide that's not patterned
correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Josh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike's going to talk about everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to tell you guys today,
our lab works on patterning, especially of
[SPEAKER_07]: leaf grasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to know how leaves are initiated
from the Maristem and how they form these
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful structures such as the blade,
dyslegia, and the sheet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done a lot of comparative analyses
between eudicot and grass leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lots of differences in morphology.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to focus today on these two,
the differences in the leaf base.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas in eudicots, the leaf bases are
usually non-sheathing, and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: accompanied oftentimes by these stipules,
these lateral derivations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas grasses form sheathing leaf bases,
as you can see better on this slide of
[SPEAKER_07]: real plants, a eudicot, this one has no
stipule, but you can see the leaf inserts,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it doesn't spread at all around the
stem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas in this grass plant, this is
maize.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see at the node, the sheath is
overlapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: It forms a sheathing leaf base where
there's a wrapper inside of a tucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know that this happens in the
sheath, anyway, at the point of emergence.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're looking here at the node in
this CT image, this computed tomography
[SPEAKER_07]: image, this is below where the leaf will
initiate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Move up a little bit, you can see they're
already overlapping as soon as they
[SPEAKER_07]: emerge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know this from CT analyses,
also from sectors.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a sector here, it'll mark both
sides of the sheath, but not the blade.
[SPEAKER_07]: They come off the meristem, they come off
the stem, already overlapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how does this happen?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've used a genetic approach to
understand how these leaves wrap.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a long time ago, we worked on these
two mutations called narrow sheath one and
[SPEAKER_07]: narrow sheath two, double mutations make a
leaf that is very, very skinny.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a model of how leaves are maybe
patterned into at least three medial
[SPEAKER_07]: lateral domains, the central domain,
which gives rise to the midrib,
[SPEAKER_07]: shown here, the lateral domain,
which is a large part of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the marginal domain.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think our narrow sheath mutants delete
this blue region here, this marginal
[SPEAKER_07]: domain, which basically goes about halfway
up the leaf blade and all the way down
[SPEAKER_07]: into the sheath.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a consequence, these leaves no
longer wrap.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look like pseudo eudicot morphology.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is almost like a pedio.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do a cross section through this
cartoon of the meristem, show these real
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the fourth leaf from the meristem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the meristem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wild type, they overlap, the marginal
domain is there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Narrow sheath removes this blue domain,
and these leaves no longer wrap.
[SPEAKER_07]: They look more like a eudicot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just quickly, look at the expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a shoot at the meristem with two
leaf primordia.
[SPEAKER_07]: About a two week old seedling.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do a cross section about this
level, you can see the meristem in the
[SPEAKER_07]: middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: This outer leaf, the second leaf of the
meristem, makes the expression,
[SPEAKER_07]: shown with this dark blue area of narrow
sheath at the margins, and it promotes
[SPEAKER_07]: growth from those margins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is actually the P1.
[SPEAKER_07]: The margins are not yet out from the
meristem, but they're gonna come out,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this marks where they're gonna form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we think the narrow sheath provides
this outgrowth from the leaf margins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in maize, there's actually two other
wax genes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is genetics, or in maize genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four of these, there's only one in
Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we knocked out these other two,
called wax 3b, wax 3a, unfortunate names,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we found that triple mutations,
with narrow sheath one, wax 3a make very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very, very skinny leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the size of the scale bars here,
compared to the narrow sheath,
[SPEAKER_07]: double mutant, and then the wild type.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are what the plants look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very, very short, and they're
very, very curly, and we think these
[SPEAKER_07]: mutations, narrow sheath one, two,
together with wax 3a, remove not just the
[SPEAKER_07]: marginal domain, shown here, but also this
large red lateral domain, all you're left
[SPEAKER_07]: with is the central domain, and these
triple mutants, and the growth happens
[SPEAKER_07]: from the upper part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the question is now, how do these
margins wrap?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the pattern of how they wrap?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been noticed that basically,
if you look again, here's the base of the
[SPEAKER_07]: sheet, there's the node, there's a wrapper
and a tucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do a cross-section of a seedling,
here's the stem, you see a couple leaves
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice, if you draw a line through the
middle of the stem, all the leaf margins
[SPEAKER_07]: that are derived from the right side of
this stem will be wrappers, and all the
[SPEAKER_07]: ones from the left side will be tuckers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this pattern is robust, it's decidedly
non-ranged, it's random, and grasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you say the same thing happens in
rice, and if you look at these as
[SPEAKER_07]: color-coded, Richie likes to color-code
these, this is wild type, maize and rice,
[SPEAKER_07]: a non-random pattern of wrapping and
tucking.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the margins coming from this side will
be wrappers, from this side will be
[SPEAKER_07]: tuckers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, are there mutations
that disrupt this pattern?
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course there are, I wouldn't tell
you about them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one, you can see everything was
good until this one made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wrong side, it's a random mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: This next one didn't really go through the
MAC to PC conversion very well,
[SPEAKER_07]: but you can see this one actually made two
mistakes, and we find this in plants that
[SPEAKER_07]: are mutated in higher order Wax 3
mutations.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if these plants are homozygous for Wax
3a, and then homozygous for at least one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the other narrow-sheet genes,
heterozygous for the other, they'll give
[SPEAKER_07]: this random patterning of wrapper tuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mistakes that these make are
random, they get more and more severe as
[SPEAKER_07]: you go up the plant, make more margins.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our mutants are in charge of this,
which was a surprise, we didn't expect
[SPEAKER_07]: this actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at it closely, looking at some
markers, and this is the cross-section
[SPEAKER_07]: through the stem wrapping and tucking,
looking at this fourth leaf shown here,
[SPEAKER_07]: the expression of this boundary gene,
CUC2, which marks very stiff cells that
[SPEAKER_07]: are very, very slow to divide.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's heavy in the tucker, not in the
wrapper.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think this prevents this margin here
from growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: In contrast, Wax 3a, a gene which makes
leaves grow from the margins, it's
[SPEAKER_07]: expressed very heavily in the wrapper part
of the P4, but not the tucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think this promotes growth to make this
thing wrap around.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we're looking at now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what Ritchie is doing now, a graduate
student in the lab is microdissecting the
[SPEAKER_07]: marginal domains of the wrapper and the
tucker, put them in separate tubes,
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out what genes are being expressed
here, doing the same thing for the lateral
[SPEAKER_07]: domains and the central domain,
put them all in different tubes,
[SPEAKER_07]: make libraries out of them and see what's
going on in terms of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, that's what we're gonna do
next.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna skip this, and I think we
have time for this weirdness.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's another mutation we're working
on in the lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually found here at Cornell by
Emerson, the person that's building this
[SPEAKER_07]: network, 1912, it's called Ligulus.
[SPEAKER_07]: This, as the name suggests, this mutation
removes the ligule, which is shown here,
[SPEAKER_07]: the boundary between the blade and the
sheath.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in wild type, we have these extended
sheath margins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at these, these are epidermally
derived, they're non-chlorophilic,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're very, very expanded in the
sheath as opposed to the margin.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think this gives rise to the ligule.
[SPEAKER_07]: Narrow sheath removes the marginal
domains, so these extended sheath margins
[SPEAKER_07]: are gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ligule's still there, but they're
gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We found that in Ligulus mutants,
and this was never described before,
[SPEAKER_07]: we see topic expression of this sheath
margin extension way up into the blade,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it always happens on the tucker side.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an asymmetric signal happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ligulus 1, unexpectedly, is also
involved in patterning this wrapper
[SPEAKER_07]: tucker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now it gets really weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at triple mutations,
narrow sheath which should have no
[SPEAKER_07]: margins, combine them with Ligulus,
somehow the margins of this triple mutant
[SPEAKER_07]: are restored.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're also topically displaced on the
tucker side only.
[SPEAKER_07]: So somehow, if you add these three
mutations together, somehow narrow sheath
[SPEAKER_07]: can now grow margins again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we suspect WAX3A is being patterned
there to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even more weirdly, if you look at
these triple mutant leaves, the base of
[SPEAKER_07]: the sheath are oftentimes fused.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: No wrapper, no tucker, they're fused.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the microscopy,
you can see these margins here,
[SPEAKER_07]: they can't decide whether to wrap or tuck,
so they're fusing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all confused.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last side shows an expression of
WAX3A, which should be heavy on the
[SPEAKER_07]: wrapper, so these two leaf margins are
confused.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know whether to wrap or tuck,
and this one is fused.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a two-headed monster.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really know which way to wrap,
which way to tuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of work to do to figure
this out in the next couple years,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'll take any questions if there's
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so we haven't, we'll ask that
question all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no done any experiments to see
whether or not this wrapper tucker
[SPEAKER_07]: mutations are affecting yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're probably never going to do those
experiments, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know that the first leaf decides the
pattern, whether it's going to wrap this
[SPEAKER_07]: way or wrap that way, and it's random.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can wrap adopts, it's a spiral
polytaxy, it's going to happen,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it may be left or it may be right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that first decision is random.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to figure out now how WAX3
somehow, in combination with Ligetis,
[SPEAKER_07]: can decide whether or not it's going to
maintain that wrapping-tucking
[SPEAKER_07]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: We suspect that the signal to wrap and
tuck, which side's going to wrap and tuck,
[SPEAKER_07]: is sent really early in leaf primordial
formation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't show everything that Richie's
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's actually going to be microdissecting
the fourth leaf in the meristem all the
[SPEAKER_07]: way up to the second leaf in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think the signal happens really early
when it sends down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the big question, is what is
the signal to make this wrapping-tucking
[SPEAKER_07]: pattern?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, this is kind of a related problem
question, but ever since QTL started to be
[SPEAKER_02]: detected, people have had this idea of
breeding by design, where we would
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what all the genes the plant
did, and then we would put the right ones
[SPEAKER_02]: in the right places, and then we would get
higher yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, as a quantitative, it seems
hopeless.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think your answer to her question is
sort of way similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wonder what you think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you study these things that I don't
know if it has an impact on yield or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: but does your research eliminate anything
about the prospects for breeding by
[SPEAKER_02]: design?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really interested in basic
fundamental mechanisms of development,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I really don't even think about making
more corn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't say that in my grant proposals,
but I really don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we need more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to lock the doors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike can't leave.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to collaborate with somebody in
this room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've collaborated with Mike Gore a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what procedure do you use to identify
the three nanoshapes?
[SPEAKER_05]: What procedure do you use?
[SPEAKER_05]: What what?
[SPEAKER_05]: What approach do we use?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I deliberately, most of my talks are
labeled genetics and genomic analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: But today I just use genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're using lots of single cell RNAseq,
spatial RNAseq, multiplex and C2s to try
[SPEAKER_07]: to figure out how these patterns are
formed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're doing lots of reverse genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we're doing trying everything we
can actually understand the mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really focused on the basic
biological mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do genes identify as reverse genetics?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nersheath 1 and Nersheath 2 were
identified a pioneer in a breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't tell us what the stock was,
but they just arose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then WAX3A and B, we made mutations by
reverse genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems as if WAX3B, I didn't mention
this, doesn't seem to have an effect in
[SPEAKER_07]: vegetative stages and might be affecting
later.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was done by reverse genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nersheath 1 and 2 were identified by
forward genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the conventional way, the old
fashioned way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it very well could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: The degree of overlap varies as you go
from the base of the plant, a grass plant
[SPEAKER_07]: to the tip.
[SPEAKER_07]: The size of the internode gets much,
much smaller as you go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they tend to overlap more in the upper
nodes and lower nodes, but they all come
[SPEAKER_07]: off the meristem, off the stem,
in the sheath anyway, overlapping.
[SPEAKER_07]: The blade components do not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wrap late.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of us for
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
