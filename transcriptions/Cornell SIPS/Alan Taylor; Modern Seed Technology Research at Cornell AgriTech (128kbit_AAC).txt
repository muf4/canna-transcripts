[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill, thanks a lot for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember interviewing for my position
back in 1981, and I was in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's been remodeled a few times since
then, but this takes me way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to try to give a history
of what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking of a title like 43 years
and 43 minutes, but I said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought maybe some of the more recent
projects and trying to what we're calling
[SPEAKER_00]: under the topic of modern seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many people, as all of us go
through Cornell, especially for such a
[SPEAKER_00]: long period, that you run across and how
they've affected you, that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been grad students in your
program, visiting scientists, a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: people, way too many to list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to mention just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Dr. Carl Leopold who was at the
board of the Boyce Thompson Institute as
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of our most famous seed
biologists the past several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say there's good teachers teach,
next level motivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually pretty inspirational in
some of the things that he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of rubbed off in some of the
early work that we did in more of the
[SPEAKER_00]: applied area in water relations of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl was also Thomas Bjorkman's PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of connects him a little bit
with some of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously my life is seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what you're going to be
hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully there may be some of the
little nuggets, some little a-has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't thought about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that would work in some things that
you're doing in your own program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we're going to start off
looking at the agronomic life cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, from production of seeds all the
way through to crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here, in focusing on vegetable crops,
most of the seed production harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not here in the Northeast in an
area where there is that much seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of that would be in the Western part
of the United States, where the climate's
[SPEAKER_00]: much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or much of it now is more of a global
business in different countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on environmental parameters that are
in that, which are optimal for those
[SPEAKER_00]: particular crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditioning is really kind of the
physical sizing of the seed, grading
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, try to improve the seed quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all when they're in the dry
condition after the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Storage of the seed, really the key there
is preservation of the seed quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The germination, the vigor of the seed
lot, this is what we're trying to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: until the time of sowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we come into the area that we're going
to be talking about is under the umbrella
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed enhancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different examples of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through a few examples of
some of our work in seed treatments and
[SPEAKER_00]: seed coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those of you familiar may have worked
with seed priming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Priming would also be listed as one of
these type of enhancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be talking about that,
though, this morning or this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed quality assurance with germination,
seed quality testing is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that the grower has high
quality seeds and has some parameter by
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the label of the seed so they
know what that quality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we move into more of what is happening
in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this part is the planting of seeds in
the crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most faculty programs are focused on
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just realize that there's many steps
to this agronomic life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done is, since we're not in a
seed producing area, is really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: target my research program in this
post-harvest area of working with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do to treat them to enhance
their performance potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of subtopics under the seed
treatments and coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about kind of the cookbook part
of the composition, the processes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, and then go through a few case
studies using organic seed treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides on onion, onion being,
obviously, a major crop here in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the work with hemp that we've
done on development of organic seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment fungicides, some of the
experimental materials that we tested at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through that kind of quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll kind of break away from the
seed treatments and try to better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the biology, the science part,
and the seed co-permeability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that then segues into our more recent
work on using some of the systemic seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not now for plant protection,
per se, but actually visualization of
[SPEAKER_00]: where the seedlings are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll become obvious as we go
through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one is kind of where our last
topic, kind of my, what I consider kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: my last topic, working with different
faculty in crop and soil science with Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: DiTomasso, John Lossi, and Entomology on
this MSCP, Multiple Seed Z appellate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at to enhance the
biodiversity with establishing various
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a member of a multi-state project,
and I think it's been very good that there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a group of US seed scientists that
work together, collaborate together,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least exchange knowledge together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a review of this seed
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it's kind of dated 1998,
that I was the senior author then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came up with this definition that
we're looking at post-harvest methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the germination or seedling growth
or facilitate the delivery of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then finally application of other
materials required at time of sowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The examples that I'm going to be talking
about really fall into number two and
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing the seed priming or we've
done work on bio-stimulants, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fall into the number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed enhancements is not just a method
per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of an umbrella
terminology for a number of technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: under that umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the different
seed coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use onions here as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onions are small seeds, irregular shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see about 3.5 millimeters the size
of the raw onion seeds in the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: right-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's different coating
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue are film coatings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The film coating is originally adapted
from the pharmaceutical and the
[SPEAKER_00]: confectionary area of the colorants and
the plasticizers, the materials that are
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those areas have then been adopted for
application of seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pelleted seeds is used on onions,
still used commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much filler material that
this kind of changes the whole ballistics
[SPEAKER_00]: and improves the plantability for the
singulation of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The encrusting is somewhat of a hybrid
between the two of the film coating and
[SPEAKER_00]: the encrusting, where there's certain
amount of materials that are used part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the buildup of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Massey's from my laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a review article came out a few
years ago trying to take a broad view of
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first is kind of the cookbook part
of all the different potential ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: that can go into a seed treatment and
coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left-hand side are the different
active components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you trying to apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our examples today are mostly focused
around the plant protectants,
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides, fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the largest part of the
market share is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taylor, but not the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to remedy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, getting back to the active
components, there are the biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's different materials
that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see the smaller,
the SYM means it's synthetic material,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be organic, the OR parentheses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of just classifies the
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next part is, what do you need to put
on with the materials?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they liquids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And water is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, we're not using any organic
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this project, started with Boyce
Thompson many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we're going to put DMSO on
tomato seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look commercially,
water is the universal carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is the universal solvent when it
comes to applying materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different binders,
which are the adhesives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully Bruce is seeing this now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will text blue.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a different constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need the adhesives, which are the
binder materials, which hold materials
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last column, the solid
particulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be these binders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of a solid particulate
binder with a filler, you're only applying
[SPEAKER_00]: powders, and then you only have to spray
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the streamlining has incurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the fillers are just materials
that have been mined, such as the
[SPEAKER_00]: limestone gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's been done to those
is just milling those to problem solve,
[SPEAKER_00]: says Bruce Rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad everybody out there can see the
slides at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this is kind of like going into
a kitchen and then having all the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to decide what you want to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the purpose for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of coating technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, for example, just because many people
are interested in organic production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would need to use an organically
approved seed treatment to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along with that organically approved
seed treatment, such as a biological,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also need to use the liquid components
and the solid particulates also have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: organically approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to consider the whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that's going onto that seed
must be organically approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, from that same review article,
methodology, we have a dry powder
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an on-farm operation where
the seeds would be treated right prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: sowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably most common is, say,
using some of the inoculant materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobium, which tend to be short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those could be treated right prior to the
sowing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rotary coder, which is probably one of
the key workhorses, where the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: material is being atomized onto an
atomization disk and then is treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can adjust by those fillers
how much of the buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the seed dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a European term, the seed
dressing, which is just what we would call
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets a little confusing on the
process-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be seed dressing, the film
coating, like I showed you, the
[SPEAKER_00]: encrustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing more and more of the
buildup of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, the seed pelleting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I mentioned this dry powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at Geneva, Kyle Wikings is our turf
entomologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a project where they have
certain biological seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biologicals cannot withstand kind
of a wetting and dryness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are very sensitive to these
hydration, dehydration events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said earlier that we have to
use water in our seed treatment and seed
[SPEAKER_00]: coating process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can't use water, then we take a
step back and use this seed powder
[SPEAKER_00]: technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything, your biological is already
is a dry powder formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mixing this, in this case,
with a telegraphite mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's being applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're OK now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they email back to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Bruce just sent a chat text.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're OK now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the upper pictures, we're looking at
some field crops we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally use a large seeded crop as
kind of as a model system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the tall fescue and
the Kentucky blue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an autofluorescence,
that bluish green color of the seeds under
[SPEAKER_00]: just a black light, long 365 nanometer
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with our coatings, we are applying a
fluorescent tracer material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you see that bright red.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this, one is it's pretty to
see these, but we're really want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that we have uniformity of
application over the seed surface and
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity from seed to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives us a visual assessment for
that delivery system of just applying a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry powder that adheres onto the seed
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of the workhorse in our
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small laboratory scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it the R6, which just means for a
six inch diameter or 15 centimeter coating
[SPEAKER_00]: pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide there on the right,
the picture on the right shows an
[SPEAKER_00]: atomization disk which goes down into the
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the liquids are applied, atomized into
very small droplets, and the seeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: being treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a rather rapid process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have even a little YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't gone viral yet, but you can
actually see the process of actually
[SPEAKER_00]: coating seeds in the delivery of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was again with this multi-state group
out at Oregon State, and then we did a
[SPEAKER_00]: little field trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this company Halsey in Halsey,
Oregon is in the Willamette Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very large seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that little rotary pane that we
have, the principles involved of a rotary
[SPEAKER_00]: is scaled up in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go in from 50 grams of seeds to
hundreds and hundreds of pounds of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technology is nice is what we can
do at the laboratory scale is directly
[SPEAKER_00]: amenable to the scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a total separate consideration
as part of the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to digress here a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these pelleted seeds,
and this is a lettuce seed which is inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a reservoir and cut through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the question is, we know for seed
storage that the moisture content of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how do you measure the moisture
content?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you access that seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you understand what that moisture
is, which is important for the storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the figure with the broccoli and the
snap bean is showing what we call a
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture isotherm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moisture isotherm is how water is held
onto the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the broccoli, which I say is similar to
soybean, that would be an oil or a lipid
[SPEAKER_00]: storing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The snap bean is a starch storing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the curves are roughly the
same shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shifted because of the oil content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to plug this, too,
that this is published.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Wien's second book is Vegetable Crop
Physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had the first edition,
and I also had the first chapter in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very proud in that long
association that I've had with Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where this moisture isotherm
shows, which is really kind of our
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of water relations in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: In storage and under the dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, with that background, now you can kind
of extrapolate the line there of,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you hold seeds at 50% relative
humidity, that will give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have laboratory instrumentation at
Geneva to actually measure what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: water activity, which is the decimal
equivalent of the relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I give this talk to a lot of
different organizations, different
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, they say, well, we don't have a
water activity instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to make this more simplified as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a handheld relative
humidity meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that inside of the Ziploc baggie or
some sort of enclosed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by measuring that relative humidity,
you then have the essence of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: water activity is of the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we use this nut is clean cut because
of the gradations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking a small piece of this paper,
putting it in with the Ziploc baggie,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just change colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, again, have an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if the moisture of the seeds is
too high, let's say 60% or higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'd have a quick diagnosis of what
the water activity is or equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now we're going to get back to
our seed treatment theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of two major groups are the chemical
seed treatments and the biological seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the chemicals, which is probably 2
thirds of the market share is in those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, insecticides and fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll have some examples of the
type of work that I've done in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with entomologists and
pathologists, mostly at Geneva,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also outside of the agri-tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tell the onion story very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came on the scene in the 80s,
this is what planting onions look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion seeds for direct seeded onions to
produce bulbing onions planted early in
[SPEAKER_00]: the season in April don't harvest until
the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The onions are grown on organic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call muck soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in the tractor in the front
is a large tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where there's big volume
gallonage with the insecticide fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these insecticides were pretty
nasty materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they've been banned in the last
few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing the use the farmers are
using pelleted seeds for singulation with
[SPEAKER_00]: a planter type called a belt seeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see those are the Stan Hay type of
a planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have the precision placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some parts of the technology
that we could kind of build on through our
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I kind of prophesied back when I
was younger and I still had red hair is I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you know, we're going to get away
from all these tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get away from all this
hauling these pesticides over to the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go back and refill again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is going to go on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed treatment is going to go right on
with the coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of what my prophecy was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little bit of pushback by some of
the pathologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going back to a previous slide
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just stick with what we did to
achieve that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you needed a seed coating
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed a delivery system of getting
these seed treatments onto the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially you're looking at pretty
high loading rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't use the little seed dressing
technique we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the pellet came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where part of the pellet during the
formation of that pellet, there could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: band called pellet loading of the
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is done by the seed treatment
industry, the seed pelleting industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it out in the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part is you need some different
materials, new chemistry materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to be very effective,
have downside, very minimal phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, which is very challenging with
specialty crops, low acreage, high value
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, is the registrant must support that
label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned about these different
pelletings.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started this project with just
comparing different pellets, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably about 10, 15 different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have five companies that do
pelleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they don't just do vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do flower seeds and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not restricted to vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's probably their largest part of
their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pelleting technology is well
worked out within these industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to call attention to the
type of pellets we call a hybrid and then
[SPEAKER_00]: a split code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the picture in the lower
left-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tan ones are what we have a split
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, the pellets are
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in a moist substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like a cleavage that the seed,
actually the pellet, opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows oxygen to get to the
germinating seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no restriction for the
germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hybrid is a hybrid between the split
code and what we call a melt code.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it just kind of dissolves
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're seeing cleavage in different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It achieves the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as pest management,
with putting seed treatments, they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: effective as delivery systems for the
insecticides, fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what some of the newer planters
look like, moving away from the old bell
[SPEAKER_00]: planters to vacuum seeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you can plant the pelleted
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also go to the encrusted seed,
the yellow ones in the upper right-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage there is there's a lot less
physical material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shipping costs are reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production costs by the seed companies
that are making these is also reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's become a little bit more
economical to go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, combining that with the vacuum
seeder technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to bring in now getting to the
chemistry materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a challenge, which is a very large
overarching problem, is the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: neonicotinoids and neonicotinoid seed
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just showing you the chemical
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name, the medical opioid, the trade
name, Gaucho, and then the company that is
[SPEAKER_00]: selling those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these are also used in onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used widely and mostly in field
crops as a seed treatment insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental concerns with colony
collapse disorder, some of the dust-off
[SPEAKER_00]: problems from those seeds that have been
treated with these new neonicotinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, we are going to have a
big problem ban of the neonicotinoid seed
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments on field crops in 2029.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our IPM group and others are working
how are we going to see some substitutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are we dealing with this challenge
with the loss of these kind of this major
[SPEAKER_00]: class of seed treatment and second side.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Geneva, we've kind of handled this in
the vegetables where we were aware of this
[SPEAKER_00]: well before there was any bans or
restrictions just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need alternate chemistries
for this efficient early season pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some early work when Brian Nault
is a vegetable entomologist and he and I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked collaborated really since he first
started at Geneva as assistant professor
[SPEAKER_00]: and now full professor and department
chair, whatever they call them now at
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva, administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the material that we latched onto is
called spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're familiar with pest
management, and foliar material,
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosad is used as a foliar insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the entrust formulation is
organically approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that organic approval,
we said aha, that is very good to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's already OMRI approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now is it going to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the work way back at the time
and it is quite effective as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling onion maggots applied as a
seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to try to put this more on
a time frame, because working on specialty
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, working on pesticides, it's a long
time of work to get something to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: light of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back to the time I
started, we did have one seed treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide, this carboxan thiram,
which also had some phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first insecticide was Brian Nault's
Prednisone.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name was Chuck Eckenrode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the mid 90s, we had that cyromazine,
which is an insecticide still used to this
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see the spinosad and some of the
far more packaging that Syngenta had done
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I didn't talk about is a more recent
seed treatment fungicide for onion smut
[SPEAKER_00]: called penflufa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see a lot of years,
a lot of time is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, is making sure that you have
the registrant, the company that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stand behind that, especially when
they're going to label that for commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Nault and I had several really good
materials, looked really great,
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent at pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the companies, for one reason or
another, said, no, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it died right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is that now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with companies that are
doing the pelleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian is leading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo is a PhD student in his laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a number of faculty in
different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Ruth McDonald's up at Guelph in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's doing trials with some of the
pellets that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Waters in Washington, Stuart in
Oregon, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're now kind of broadened out with
some of the field testing in cooperation
[SPEAKER_00]: with Field Entomology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christy Hoping is with CCE.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's out in the Batavia area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with her on some of the seed
treatment fungicides as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of a continuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just our work and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a continuation that I want to
talk about in several of these topic
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next case study is going to be with hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Larry Smart first kind of formed the
Cornell team, we were fortunate to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dealing with some of the seed science
and technology issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, well, we're going to
treat the seeds and some of our standard
[SPEAKER_00]: coating materials we are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's green on that middle
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very splotchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were well treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weren't treated at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, we really need a much better
film coating polymer to give us uniformity
[SPEAKER_00]: of application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have good context with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the seed industry, with companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this happened to be in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, we have this new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has kind of a waxy seed covering to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any film forming materials that
you have that might work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they knew nothing about hemp at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they said, we've developed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've used this on sorghum as another waxy
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have good relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't tell me all the leaven herbs
and spices that are in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they provided my laboratory with this
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had these long term relationships
with these seed enhancement companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they're willing to collaborate with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not give us all the leaven herbs and
spices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very fortunate that we don't have to
do every inch of the way on the
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we would never be able to do the
things and accomplish what we need to if
[SPEAKER_00]: we had to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're looking for control of
damping off much of that caused by
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's other pathogens involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be biochemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical materials, organic copper and
phosphate materials would be examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to kind of cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in this,
I can send you the PDF of the paper we
[SPEAKER_00]: published a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just think up in the green are all the
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichodermas, the bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the major materials that have been
used for a number of years for controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: of damping off in other cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those in the middle in red is our organic
copper, our phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd call these biochemical material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group in blue are chemical fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our apron XL maximum type of materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are widely labeled on most crop
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the seed treatment lists that
we went into with this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the screening we do in the
laboratory is how can we make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these have efficacy or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to taking a field soil,
actually just not too far from here in
[SPEAKER_00]: East Ithaca, that had natural levels of
pythium present in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's damping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of damping off from that
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're using that mixed with sand over
our roll tongue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the brown paper is from our
germination test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at a time course with the
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp germinate very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after four days, we're already seeing a
nice root and shoot on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After seven days, there's quite a bit of
damping off and death of the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much everything is wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of our screening assay
that we were using in my laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the data from that on the
far left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black is the non-treated control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing is we tested all
these biologicals, all the hopes of
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them were worth a darn.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them really gave any level of
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phosphite material gave some level of
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, the ultum, which is the
organic copper with the letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A on the top, was just as good as many of
the apron maxims, some of the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, through the IR4, did two years of
testing at Cornell, Virginia Tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: North Dakota State, where we had field
testing under multiple locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just kind of go through this
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just from one of the sites,
East Ithaca, where we knew we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were generally seeing some of the
materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are the trade names,
but the organic materials, the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical materials looking quite well
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the biochemical materials
looking quite promising with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been organically approved for
other applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemicals worked very well,
but Syngenta owns those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically said, we're not
interested in supporting anything on hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of our biologicals, really,
were worth the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after we finished this, Chris Smart and
her PhD student, Patrick McMullen,
[SPEAKER_00]: have done some additional work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just kind of summarizing some of
that work up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been continuation and further
field testing at Geneva with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: key, kind of our optimal treatments from
this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Geneva colleagues are going to
remember some of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this was taken, I was department
chair of what we called horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: sciences at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luanne Rego in the upper left-hand
corner was the administrative assistant
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people from my laboratory,
Joe Shale, worked for many, many years in
[SPEAKER_00]: the upper right, worked with Dick Robinson
in the plant breeding program,
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with Thomas Bjorkman and I towards
the end of his career.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower right is Julia Selinger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's done a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had kind of the good seed physiology
training from Belarus, came to my
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory, and we're going to kind of
talk into some of the work that she did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a seed treatment work, per se,
but I thought I'd throw this in just as I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to see what people look like way back
in the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so seed treatments can have two
different kind of modes of movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can either work as a contact
material, some of the older materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungicides, captan, thyram,
have that type of contact activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the newer, many of the newer ones,
have systemic activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The systemic activity allows uptake by the
roots into the transpiration stream all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, when some of our seed treatments
and some of the neonicotinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but others, were coming along,
we were asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that they were taken up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're killing cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're beetles with a systemic seed
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our question was, is how are these
materials moving into the, are they moving
[SPEAKER_00]: through the seed coat into the seed and
taken up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they actually moving?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of our curiosity at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing is what, and this applies if
you're applying herbicides or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: material, and you're looking at systemic
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the physical chemical properties
that that compound has to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: A compound must have a balance between the
hydrophilic and the hydrophobic character
[SPEAKER_00]: to enter into root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the classic work was done on this
in the early 80s with herbicide movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have what's called a partition
coefficient, where you put the material in
[SPEAKER_00]: with water and octanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Octanol is an 8-carbon alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does it partition into those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives you an idea of that
relationship with the hydrophilic
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come up with kind of this Gaussian
distribution, or you call it a bell-shaped
[SPEAKER_00]: curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of our seed treatments are
shown here, the thiamethoxine,
[SPEAKER_00]: metocloprid, clopthionid.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the neonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotamine B we'll talk about is not a
pesticide, but a fluorescent tracer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be talking about this in the
next section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the other materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the materials have their own
particular log of KOW, also called the log
[SPEAKER_00]: of P, the partition coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells us their relative water
solubility and lipid solubility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the top of that Gaussian
distribution is where there'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest amount of systemic uptake for a
particular compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're not interested in
herbicide uptakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really interested in seed coat
permeability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these materials, do they actually
enter into the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they blocked by the seed coat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can have a visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided early on when we were doing
this work, if we had to get C14 labeled or
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways of trying to trace these
materials, one, it'd be very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be even more difficult to dispose of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided at the time,
we need a better system that we can do in
[SPEAKER_00]: a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we adopted the use of these fluorescent
tracers that we could get the particular
[SPEAKER_00]: log of KOW.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could get a lot of their particular
characteristics along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence and their movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you have, in this case,
was tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a project a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then say if you have an internal
seed-borne pathogen, a bacterial pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the embryo, and you say, well,
we'll just soak the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chemical is going to get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, does it really get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what kind of our inquiry was
is, are these materials that, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're soaking the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, they take up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is the active material getting to the
seed, getting to the embryo more
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we end up with three classifications
based on their seed coat permeability.
[SPEAKER_00]: A soybean is the same as our bean family,
physiolus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have compounds that are non-ionic or
ionic in nature, both of those will move
[SPEAKER_00]: through the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, we're applying these as
a seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in a moist soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those seeds take up water,
it would basically allow the materials to
[SPEAKER_00]: migrate into the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a visualization of the movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next group is in many crops,
switchgrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found hemp is going to be in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion, tomatoes, just a number of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call selective permeable
seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selective meaning that only the non-ionic
compounds which is the coumarins,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are this light blue fluorescence
that you're seeing, is actually moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhodamine is an ionic material,
charged molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is being blocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the tomato is very vivid in
the tomato hairs is that ionic material
[SPEAKER_00]: being dropped there and not getting into
the embryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a last group,
which we're calling the non-permeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is with the cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cucurbits have particular morphology
with the endosperm envelope, acts like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little cellophane around there,
is blocking both compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say non-permeable,
people think, well, these seeds take up
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not hard seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, don't be confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a hard seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The layers that surround the embryo are
actually barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this just is from some of our
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, hemp we added through some of
our earlier work onto this would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: example of the selective permeability.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we're going to kind of take with that
basis that we're using fluorescent tracers
[SPEAKER_00]: and how can we kind of exploit this into
kind of what we'll talk about into a weed
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Yu Jing was hired at Geneva as
an engineer, he had a lot of knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to do work with imaging
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're treating this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just showing some bean seeds with
the rhodamine, which to us visually be
[SPEAKER_00]: red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has a strong fluorescence to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The setup that was built with using
particular wavelength lights, LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see in the green, where we're
exciting the rhodamine and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the lights that were set up,
some of the physical hardware that he
[SPEAKER_00]: developed that we used in our laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have non-treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're treating the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we're treating the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planting the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed grows into a seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking at, does the
material translocate up into the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using the white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at reflection of light
under the non-treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, well, there's a green
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're taking a little leaf disc
punch so we can quantify from a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rhodamine treated seed looks about
the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now if we look at that, the rhodamine
fluorescence under the fluorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: detection system, the imaging system,
we're just showing the silhouette.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't even see the fluorescence,
because there's nothing to be taken up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the non-treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can see exactly the leaf,
and particularly the veins of the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: is why these compounds have apoplastic
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming up through the
translocation stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get deposited into the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see these materials quite
vividly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've taken that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with our hemp project that we had
going concurrently, we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's maybe difficult to see,
but we're looking at pelleted hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our pelleting technology we talked
about, we actually had a company do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're adding rhodamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those in the upper right have that
purplish color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually treated those with
rhodamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we did the seed treatment,
is by treating the pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, doing the same type of work that we
did with the sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's just look at the graphical
part on the right, where you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: just a trace amount of background of
fluorescence from the pellet only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also growing these with a velvet
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a weed, as our model weed in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then where you had the hemp pellet
with RB, which stands for the rhodamine B,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we see extremely over 10-fold
increase in the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going with this,
is bringing Lin into the program with
[SPEAKER_00]: this, is that this could actually go to
the field where you actually treat the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, your crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to identify those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the weeds that are around that
are not having the rhodamine B,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're not taking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have a way to differentiate
based on the fluorescence profile of the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, the treated crop, versus the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of a graphical
abstract from the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of as a landmark for us,
Massey's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yujing and Lin, we spent a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just finished a paper and just got it
accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our big yay to get this stuff
to see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a special issue of exploring
application of artificial intelligence and
[SPEAKER_00]: image processing in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, this is pretty neat that we
made it with the AI papers as well with
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this project with Yujing and the
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to the last section now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing about pest management here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking a different angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the laws of biodiversity,
which was attributed to the use of GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have all these herbicide resistant
genes, we can see soybeans before rondo.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the farmers hate those weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we had the GMO technology,
then we said, how clean the fields look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers loved no weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is is when we do that,
then we start losing the biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insects, some of the other
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that we're interested in is
particular is in the monarch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The decline of the monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monarch requires milkweed to complete
its lifecycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we lose the milkweed, we don't have
a place for the monarchs to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: to multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, John Losey from Entomology is a
project leader on our current grant with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony DiTomaso in weed science here in Soil
and Crop Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just from data from the
literature of looking at this decline in
[SPEAKER_00]: the milkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of defining what the problem
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing this concomitment loss
in the monarch population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to a critical situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of our challenge that we
took on kind of as our Cornell team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that the monarch butterfly
is now listed as endangered by this
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out endangered 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our challenge is how do you restore the
milkweed population if we could restore
[SPEAKER_00]: the milkweed?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping that we can reestablish the
monarchs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we have to go to the milkweed seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we look in the lower right-hand
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: The milkweed seeds, we have the dimensions
there, but they're very flat seeds and a
[SPEAKER_00]: pear-shaped seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't use, you can't go and use
your conventional planter to plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not handleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specialized planters,
native seed drills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been dealt very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most farmers aren't going to have
something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our paradigm shift is let's develop a
new seed technology where we can plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: milkweed seeds, but use the farmer's
existing corn planter or existing crop
[SPEAKER_00]: planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of is in a nutshell of what
we developed together and actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent application on this, starting off
with the milkweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're then considering this to go,
say, into a field corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using field corn to make 3D
molds, that shape of the flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know corn, and you do, large flat
corn seeds is our model that we're making
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is we're making a mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're putting a dough with the
seeds inside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we get the MSZP,
multiple seed Zia for corn, pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're having these seeds, the milkweed
seeds embedded into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can then go ahead and use a
conventional planter to show a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: seeder there on the right hand side that
we have as a model system in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can go ahead and plant those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of where our first ideas
and kind of the conception of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could try to take these
pollinator species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not lend themselves to our planning
technology and then put them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done the research innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is how are you going to scale up?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making 40 of these MSZPs at one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to take 46,000 to plant
an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how are we going to do that huge
multiplication?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the scale up now becomes very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based outside of Atlanta,
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Kanner, collaborating with
them on the scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's already other, Cortiva on the
lower right hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cortiva, you may not know the name,
but Cortiva owns Pioneer Seed Company,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the largest field crop companies in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to be our conduit to
connect this to our row crop growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is our scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're working towards
right now is to get from the basket at the
[SPEAKER_00]: patent application all the way to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I'm probably running over time a
little bit, but I want to thank everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masi is here from my laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we've taken and used different
aspects, our tools and seed science and
[SPEAKER_00]: technology to address particular problems
in vegetable crops and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions for Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a really good seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 43 years ago, you called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that's what's going on to the
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 43 or 44 years from now, what does seed
technology look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Justine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of for everybody, just a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so Justine asked, that was a nice
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of some of the things that we've done in
modern seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the next 40 years look like in
modern seed technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, much of the work that is
going on is going on within industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always know that until it's
actually developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very small university base
that kind of, besides the US, kind of on a
[SPEAKER_00]: global basis working in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing right now in horticulture
is we've had the approval to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of fill my position, but basically
is to continue in the seed biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed technology area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Larry Smart is chairing that search
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping to hire a person kind of
in this general vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly how they're going
to, what projects they would do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of in this general area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's going to be a need because of
seed technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the importance of high quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing mostly of veg crops and
ornamental seeds that are direct seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: field crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has implications with others,
like the weed seeds with our pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of use of seeds,
both in agriculture and what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of opportunities,
a lot of challenges in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I think where the
challenges are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never thinking about the monarch
butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Tony and John approached me with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there it is, and now what are we going
to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's going to be a lot of
those a-ha type of things where we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: with the background and the knowledge that
we've kind of started and others can
[SPEAKER_00]: continue in this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's a lot of work that's going
on with industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to have to be kind of
integrated or at least be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested before we can even hand it over to
our growers and say, yeah, this is ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and do something when it's a
pretty new technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's definitely the research
component, but also the extension outreach
[SPEAKER_00]: component about what is coming along now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what may be available for New
York agriculture in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: or vegetable and other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything from Geneva question wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing anything on chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me Steve Reiners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, Steve Reiners.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Alan Taylor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much a question, but sort of just
wanted to thank you for the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've done over the years because you
have been extremely helpful to me and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know to many other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we always talked about, you always
shared your toys quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shared your expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that, I just really wanted to
thank you for all the work that we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: together over the years too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, while it makes me excited
to go to work every day, is the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I get to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outside of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be somebody at the University of
Guelph or it could be somebody in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really makes it fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thank you for that, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I do like to share our toys here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do these treatments today exist for tree
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you know of any studies that you
looked at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Occultating seeds with beneficial
microbes, such as mycorrhizal fungal,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the question was on tree seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where is seed technology on tree
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any, say, registered
materials like a fungicide, even though it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be very effective for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there would be an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, since I can't really answer it,
it's some of the biological that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for some of the damping off
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some of the beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it comes into the delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big are the spores that you have to
apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the size of the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it is how do you develop the
coding technology for that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: biological and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely not as knowledgeable
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I look at it, kind of looking
backwards is the vegetable seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the value of the seeds,
and you have high value small seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, lower value large seeded crops,
there's a lot of different challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that that's developed
then will spin off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tree seeds, not that they're
not important, but there's a lot they can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of adopt from some of the work that's
already being done with some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have to do some homework to better
answer that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
