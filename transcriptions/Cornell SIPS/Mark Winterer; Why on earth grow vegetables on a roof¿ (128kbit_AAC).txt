[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good morning, almost good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrie, I felt very rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to push you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like a very interesting
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, the tie-in between your topic
and invasive species, I can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They breed boot-up farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, they become invasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin thinks that they are the future of
farming, which I think that is the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Martin Winter, co-founder,
director of operations for Recover Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We specialize in putting all sorts of
plants out on the roof, from very
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow-rooted ground covers to big trees
and everything in between, including
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root-pop farms are about 10% of the work
that we do, the projects we install,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is far away the most exciting type
of thing that we have designed and built
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Martin recruited me, I told him I'm a
package deal for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to invite my wife and baby with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are having a good trip out here and
falling in love with Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found an unlikely career path to be
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In college, I studied writing and studio
arts, which may or may not have prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: me for five years in the beer industry
before I left to go to business school,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I got my MBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my first formal training was in my
mom's garden in a small town on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecticut River.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my father was a restaurateur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So food was absolutely the center point of
our family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ate a lot of what we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally, at the end of every meal,
talked about what our next meal was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds crazy, but I actually think it
makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to miss a meal,
that's what happens if you miss a meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2013, my company designed and built
a root-pop farm on top of a Whole Foods in
[SPEAKER_00]: Linfield, Mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like I had come full circle and
reentered the food industry in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: I never would have imagined when I was
growing vegetables in my mom's garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole Foods is an incredible client to
work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I are now very loyal Whole
Foods customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hired us to design and build this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a root-pop farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hired Dream City Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the Dream City Growers
farmers up there farming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell all the produce in the store
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a huge project for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put us on the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started noticing what we were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have to explain what a green
roof was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boss in globe took notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know all about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did two hour and a half long
interviews with them on the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very happy with all the answers
that I gave about root-pop farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talked about fresh, local, organic,
supporting a local economy, hiring these
[SPEAKER_00]: two small companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all the benefits from green roofs,
which is storm water management,
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat creation, the air filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked about how great Whole Foods
was and what a great client they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember that I knew the day it was
going to be published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was driving to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we finally had made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like I was going to be a local
celebrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought people would recognize me
walking down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I walked into the office,
literally nobody would look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I opened up the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all the things I said, the one
quote I got was that the cost of that
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis does not add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my business partner was furious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green city growers hated me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like I was the enemy of
root-pop farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I did not kill the root-pop
farming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have since built four root-pop
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like every single cold call
we get is a customer interested in growing
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables on their roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wonder, considering how
challenging and expensive and difficult it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to grow food on the roof, I wonder why
anybody would want to grow vegetables on
[SPEAKER_00]: their roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to end at 1230.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to stay on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have 35 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about 15 to 20 slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last slide is a video that I was going
to quote from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was reviewing it this morning,
I thought, wow, this is a 10 minute video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does a great job of answering these
questions, has some great interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to get there and play
it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we don't get there, I can try to
give this synopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Marco Suarez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marco Suarez was the head chef of
Alleged Kitchen and Drinks in Boston,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a new restaurant started by
three men from the construction industry
[SPEAKER_00]: who had no idea about how to run a
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did hire Marco, who was a
passionate chef, and he believed in trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the freshest ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very proud of what he was cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he believed that food was better with
fresh ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he heard about Eagle Street Rooftop
Farm, which was one of the first rooftop
[SPEAKER_00]: farms in the US and Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one night, all the stars aligned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2010, my business partner was out
at some kind of event at a bar,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was introduced to Marco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Marco was so excited to meet a company
that actually built these.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our first rooftop farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built green roofs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rooftop farm is the title of a green
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doggedly pursued the owners until
they finally at yes and agreed to hire us
[SPEAKER_00]: to build a rooftop farm on top of their
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, my business partner and I
recovered green roofs right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of the urban ag movement, which has been
an incredibly exciting and unexpected
[SPEAKER_00]: development since we started our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one of our first projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were so concerned about the loading
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with the structural engineer,
the waterproofing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the roof re-waterproofed to make
sure there weren't any leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were concerned about non-toxic
materials, knowing that we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be growing edibles up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't think too much about
building those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't even think about applying
for a permanent, which is fortuitous,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we probably wouldn't have gotten a
permanent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This project never would have been built.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't think at all about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business partner and I are somewhat
fearless and never looked over the edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the roof or worried about falling off of
it until we heard that the mayor's office
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about this project and wanted to
come see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be up to code.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might see something that they
shouldn't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put up this orange construction
line six feet from the roof edge and tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to convince the mayor's office that this
wasn't up to code and it was perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this was a guerrilla rooftop
farm and never got permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, luckily, we got away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor's office was actually great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in this video if I get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is how we accessed the roof via
ladder, which is absolutely not up to
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two farmers from Green City
Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they recruit their farmers based on
whether they have a fear of heights or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can climb off the ladder with one
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything goes up and down that
ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the compost and the spring,
all the seedlings and all the tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the shovels, and then all the harvest
goes back down that ladder and right into
[SPEAKER_00]: the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an ideal roof for those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not up to code.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a beautiful roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely transformed that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an architectural photographer take
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he taught me a great secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell all of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take pictures during the sunrise because
it gives it that nice golden glow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project is what led to our Whole
Foods project, which is what put us on the
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to introduce Andy Novak and Ben
Flander, who were part of the founding
[SPEAKER_00]: team of Eagle Streets Rooftop Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody heard of Eagle Streets?
[SPEAKER_00]: One person, two people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredibly exciting project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was built back in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building owners financed the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: They worked with a New York City green
roof company called Good Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got the help of Andy and Ben and
a volunteer crew to build this roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an incredibly successful project
in that it generated an incredible amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of excitement, including with Marco
Suarez, the chef who hired us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it was financed by the
building owner, they weren't too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of little room to
experience what they were growing up
[SPEAKER_00]: there, how to distribute the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they slowly started focusing their
efforts on educational programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do what Ben told me is when they
brought kids up there from New York City
[SPEAKER_00]: who had never been outside the confines of
New York City, had never actually seen
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always took for granted where their
food came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go out on a roof and actually see
vegetables growing out of the ground was
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-opening for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they realized they had a great
educational opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have since developed a lot of
educational curriculum around farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm sure you are familiar with,
planting, maintaining, harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have cooking classes up there,
composting, they have beehives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the year, Ben Flanner
wanted to prove that the cost benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis can add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was less interested in the educational
programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to say, this is a viable
business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went out and he found this roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, he was able to put
together a profitable business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some things that, oh,
by the way, I forgot to mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: when my quote came out, a box and globe
about the cost benefit analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were paid for the initial investment
was paid for out of the whole food's
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the revenue that they made selling the
produce in the store below barely pays for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farming of green city growers' costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a profitable business model
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big difference with the Brooklyn
Rain is they benefit from economies of
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a full acre roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Whole Foods was less than half of that
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also was able to take advantage of
volunteer labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rooftop farm gave people the chance
to farm, which they never had that chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it before, anywhere in the New York
City area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were happy to do this for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they effectively were able to get a
team of volunteer laborers to farm it and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep their costs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a grain market.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers markets that they
self-distribute to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of local restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brooklyn has every other restaurant
serving local food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a vitamin CSA program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ben Plano realized that that in and of
itself, just the revenue from selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables still wasn't enough to help
them make profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they realized that they had more value
than just the produce itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they had was an incredible space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this picture, I pulled this up on
Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take this picture myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that this picture in itself
might answer the question of why I never
[SPEAKER_00]: grow vegetables on a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the city, in New York
especially, you're really stuck inside a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a lot of open air,
fresh air, to enjoy the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bare roof is a fairly un-hospitable
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: A black roof gets up to 160 degrees in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not a comfortable place to
sit and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you put down a farm on it,
it brings that ambient air temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: down to a much more hospitable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates this beautiful open air
urban oasis, which you don't have very
[SPEAKER_00]: much of in cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as our cities grow, and they are all
projected to double in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: decades, all those buildings are taking up
all the green open space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's left is a lot of roof space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can you transform that roof space
and make it into a place to enjoy like
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to sell these tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Ben told me about these tickets,
I had to include the table dinners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me they were selling those seats
for $75 a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big revenue channel for the
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a place for them that help them
become profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other really magical thing about
an open air rooftop farm in a city where
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't much open air and green space
is that you're also elevated to the street
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a world of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pedestrians, the cars, they have a lot
of really strong, rushed energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to go up a few stories and to escape
that street level energy really creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, peaceful oasis up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could add to this presentation on
that slide, but I still have 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do more than just those food and
table events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have host weddings up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Michael Bloomberg up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got big funding from the Department
of Environmental Protection because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to manage storm water, which is
incredibly expensive for cities to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it's very hard to build
any infrastructure under their streets to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage all this storm water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also obviously have value-added
products like this hot sauce that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: make much more money with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of money selling hot sauce
than they can the peppers themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other feature they don't have up here
are t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a lot of money selling t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were able, Brooklyn Grange was
able to make some money rooftop farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't just selling the vegetables
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really selling the brand and the
space that they created.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Loopfoot Farms in Montreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anybody familiar with this project?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the most impressive,
probably my favorite model for rooftop
[SPEAKER_00]: farming growing business sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was founded by Mohamed Hay,
who's Lebanese, where farming is very
[SPEAKER_00]: personal to him because it's very hard to
farm in Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that he understands the
importance of feeding populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mission is to feed big populations
in city centers where there isn't much
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is also a businessman, and he
realizes in order for a business model to
[SPEAKER_00]: be sustainable, it has to be financially
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he's able to do here with his
greenhouse that Ben can do at Brooklyn
[SPEAKER_00]: Grange is grow 12 months out of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he uses hyperconics inside that
greenhouse, and hyperconics yield much
[SPEAKER_00]: more produce than soil does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was on a panel with Mohamed,
and he brought all the vegetables and was
[SPEAKER_00]: handing out these tomatoes to prove that
hydroponic food actually tastes pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did taste pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cherry tomatoes are very sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for him and for Mohamed, rooftop
farming is about food security and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing and feeding big city centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the Boston Medical Center,
which is a rooftop farm built in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not selling these vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are paying for the farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid for the install.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually got a founder at an auction
to pay for the install.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire cost of this install.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hired a farmer to do all the
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give all the produce to their low
income patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's part of a new effort they're
doing that's more about holistic healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's so ironic to go to a hospital
and the food is almost inedible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think good healing involves healthy
diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Boston Medical Center is trying
to bring that into their equation of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with patients and giving them
healthy food as part of the healing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Boston Medical Center was designed,
was based on what we did at Fenway Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Fenway Farms, which is a
rooftop farm we built back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were ready on opening day, which was
April 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a week before, there was snow on that
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to do a lot to get those
vegetables planted in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their original interest in rooftop
farming was to show their commitment to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they first reached out to us,
they said, hey, this is a great way to
[SPEAKER_00]: show our fans that we care about the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Linda Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know who Linda Henry is?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the older wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is the older wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is a urban agricultural supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wanted to grow vegetables
somewhere at Fenway Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she heard about the projects we were
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were originally going to make this one
of those seed-owning expenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is more about stormwater management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, you can't eat seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put food up there that you can't
eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was able to loosen up her
husband's wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't pay the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is right after we bought the
European soccer team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, if you can afford a,
it's not the infrastructure you made,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a Liverpool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can afford a Liverpool soccer team.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can afford a rooftop farm on Fenway
Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so successful that year two,
they extended Fenway Park.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys see the difference there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they realized is they made that
farm really transform that space and made
[SPEAKER_00]: it a beautiful space that people wanted to
be out and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they created the second one that was
occupiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this first one isn't wheelchair
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, the public can't go out on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they wanted to allow the public to go
out there to enjoy that open-air urban
[SPEAKER_00]: oasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made this, they call this the
Strait of Death back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see that there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they built this, the Huffington
Post rated this the number one secret spot
[SPEAKER_00]: in Boston to go visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows what a magical space a
roof can be elevated from a city with
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful views.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the farm before we installed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants really transformed that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an underutilized space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there on the right,
that's where all the fans go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stadium is on the far right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the lights here from the
stadium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are where all the food
concession stands are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see a lot of people have
visible access to that roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they Fenway loved, much rather had
this beautiful food, vegetable production
[SPEAKER_00]: farm than just a black, underutilized
water proof membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, they do, this is
incredible to me, they give daily tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days a week, every hour,
a limit of 50 people per tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tour is sold out and they do it 365
days a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Fenway farm is the number one
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come out and they're not expecting
to see these vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just jaw dropping when you're not
expecting to see this and just see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it leaves room for exploration
and discovery and for seeing things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not expecting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people really are
impressed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By a few, I think it's the term,
people are attracted to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be remiss not to talk about
community growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Jessie Van Hazel on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: She bones and runs community growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Ron Ebel on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the executive chef at Fenway Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would not work without those two
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farming is incredibly hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you all know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes commitment and patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Green City Growers is the dedicated
farming staff to do all that farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without them, this wouldn't be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Ron Ebel plays a critical role
because he has the challenge of actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking this food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is at the mercy of the weather and
the harvest and he has to adjust his menu
[SPEAKER_00]: to whatever is in season and is being
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires him to be creative and
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can't just go in and do the same
thing every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what keeps him at Fenway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me he wouldn't want to go into the
kitchen and cook the same thing every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would bore him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this farm really excites his passion
to be able to use his creativity and to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with the food that is being
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a real poet, if you ever talk to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just talks about food and ingredients
and what he can do with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's doubly challenging for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does he have to juggle the season
and the harvest, but he also has to juggle
[SPEAKER_00]: the red sack schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the team is on the road and he
has a beautiful harvest, it's tough for
[SPEAKER_00]: him to take advantage of what is being
harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that actually fair?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually fair, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually fair and the farmers love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take their shoes off up there and
walk around barefoot in the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that I came to be on my
presentation because this video is for
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you guys that we did set this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is...
[SPEAKER_03]: People are really curious about food and
they're really curious about what it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've seen just in attendance in this
building alone kind of coming up and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking around and being curious about
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all this unused space in the
city in the form of rooftops that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: uncovered causes environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hover it, you're growing awesome
food while providing environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give that a laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the guys who came to the
ledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And
we never lived down here before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to think about, could we take
this to a larger scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we use it to really make an impact?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are
[SPEAKER_02]: problems that are associated with farming
in city centers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made business farming difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Engaging in leases is difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this really opens up the possibility
for both small and large entrepreneurs to
[SPEAKER_04]: engage in their business practices if
they're fortunate enough to do so many
leases with a good man.
And so particularly we're willing to
encourage it in order for that to happen
on a broader scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ultimately we want to have a
pretty diverse market, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: direct to the community, through a CSI or
farm standard of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we really just focused on
restaurants and retailers because we
[SPEAKER_01]: already kind of had this relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we had a product to sell,
they were well aware of what we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and wanting to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really one of the key things
about us starting this business was we
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that we had a lot of relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food is grown really well and we also
[SPEAKER_05]: have the environment in the city that
we're living in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do occasionally ask the volunteers to
come and help.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city, you get most of the food out
[SPEAKER_01]: of a couple of those insulating factors,
the buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The building owner is paying less money,
using less energy because their roof is
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it's amazing every room we
build, we're seeing the company live.
[SPEAKER_05]: And
[SPEAKER_04]: so I expect to see businesses and
explorers that are supporting farmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit of this video is they can
do a lot of editing, which you can't do in
[SPEAKER_00]: my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have any time for any
questions or answers, but I do have some
[SPEAKER_00]: brochures on our business and a business
card if anybody would like to contact
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've got a couple minutes for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's lunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's for lunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the local harvest is tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's BLT season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
