[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here today and we'll
just talk to you about some of the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've done over the last 40 years or
so before I retired and after as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it would be useful with a lot
of studies over the years, you study
[SPEAKER_00]: different components of a system and it's
kind of helpful to then stand back and
[SPEAKER_01]: take a look at the whole system and see
maybe how those components can interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought apple-water relations would
be a complex of interactions that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apple, of course you're all familiar
with domestic apples in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they actually have the center of
origin in the lower mountains in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a picture of apple
forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Kazakhstan where the primary trees are
all apples and so the commercial varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: came from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that there seems to be a
rather neurodune pool so that our
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial varieties are relatively close
to the wild types and there's been very
[SPEAKER_00]: little if any breeding for water
relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been primarily for yield and improved
quality and sustainable bearing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not for water relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really thinking of the plant as a
wild plant and so the climate there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been there and it's a little hard to
get good data from this remote area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it appears to be an area with some dry
periods in the summer, but not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a period where it seems to be a
moderate climate with dry periods in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the leaf size and shape
suggests it's a relatively basic type of
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we think the physiology
evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one way of looking at water relations
was suggested by Neil Turner to look at a
form for looking at the water relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is drought avoidance or
escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you think of the femuroles
growing in the desert as a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: escaping, but if a plant is able to grow
in very cool season conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's a way of avoiding the
midsummer drought condition.
We'll talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is if they do have to grow
through the summer, you can try to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the water potential at a high
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there is stress,
you tolerate the drought by maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: high water potentials in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually through reduction of
water loss, thick cuticles, stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior, reduction of radiation,
reduction of leaf area, those sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another aspect of maintaining the
water is to maintain the water uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either increased root density or depth
finding more water and or increased root
[SPEAKER_00]: conductivity to get the water potential
maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course if it has to tolerate a more
severe drought, then there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms such as osmotic adjustment to
maintain turgor.
And we'll mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase in cell elasticity and size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that really hasn't been
looked at, particularly with apples,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I won't really get into that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at some of these ways of
looking at them, and then we'll look at
[SPEAKER_00]: some three implications for practical
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the avoidance issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root habit of apple, there tends to be
two types of shoots, although they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that in a mature plant,
we have these very short shoots that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a rosette of leaves.
They're called the spurs.
And there's preformed leaves within that
bud.
And it's also the place where the flowers
and fruit are born.
And so these preformed leaves come out
very quickly in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are simple lateral shoots
off of that that can develop more leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it tends to produce a short
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a little rosette with
another short shoot on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes that spurt complex that you
see on the right.
These come out very quickly in the spring.
And they can develop a very significant
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the bottom here, you can see a
corn field in late May.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's actually typical,
or they've just planted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in late May, this was a field that
ended up being corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right, you can see the
canopy of apples is really quite well
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin growing fairly early,
mid April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their conditions are quite cool.
They have a temperature around 12 and 4
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by about 30 days or so after bloom,
or after a bud break, they bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that time, you have something in
the neighborhood of 20% to 30% of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: area that they're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe 40%, maybe up to 50% of the
light intersection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a very rapid canopy
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are able to develop a lot of that
canopy and productivity before we have
significant drop stress development.
As you mentioned also, the leaf fall in
the autumn depends on temperature,
not on focal period.
So when you have a very long growing
season, like in New Zealand or further in
Italy, they may have leaf fall in
Christmas time, not New Zealand.
But they can have very long growing
seasons.
And the leaves will stay on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the weather stays good, they can stay
on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure later it can be very productive
as well.
So the other type of shoot are the
extension shoots, which are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow out the long-inter nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaves are spaced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These can grow basically all season long
as an indeterminate shoot, although it
[SPEAKER_00]: will set a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the weather conditions are good,
it will continue to grow, or it may retry
[SPEAKER_00]: if the weather gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way that the plant develops a
very quick canopy in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if the weather conditions allow
and it's good water status, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to grow far into the season.
Very often here, we will see them stop
growing basically by the end of late July.
But they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cases I've seen in northern Italy,
they were actually growing in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives that flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can also stop very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may not only grow just a few
centimeters if you have a very dry early
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the season.
So it's a flexible response in terms of
reducing the potential leaf area.
Not necessarily excising leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things that they
mentioned is reduction in water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned cuticle, and apples do have
a very quite a thick cuticle.
So that's effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the variable one obviously is the
model behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that's fairly unique
with apple.
That is if you look at the photosynthesis
versus the leaf inductance.
And this is in field trees under our
normal summer conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see that type of hyperbolic
curve that you might expect with the
[SPEAKER_00]: opening of the stomates in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We almost always find a very linear
relationship between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomates seem to be very highly
coupled to the photosynthesis.
And so we get a linear relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing we see is that they
don't open anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the photosynthesis continues to rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most cases, you'll see the stomal
conductors open more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the photosynthesis levels out.
And so you'll see they will tail off on
the right side.
We don't see that with apples.
They tend to open up and estimate the
stomal limitations around 20%,
30%.
And they just don't open up excessively
under normal field conditions.
Now this data actually is, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the actual data from three
different sets of measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pink squares are the controls that are
healthy and well watered, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green triangles are from trees that
are water stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue symbols are from branches
that we brittle the branch to cause
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback inhibition and shut down the
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet they all fall in exactly the same
regression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've learned that over the years that
in the field we see a very, very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: coupling between the photosynthesis and
the stomal behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is fairly unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: We in the field almost never see very high
stomal conductors.
Now I'll show you conditions when that's
not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I should mention that in the field
what happens is that because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically linear, you tend to have a very
relatively constant water use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assuming you don't add any pressure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your deficit because you're opening
up the stomates at the same rate as the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water use efficiency across that
range is really quite constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in many cases if the stomates open
up too much and the photosynthesis doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, you'll see it decline from the
IM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apples have a very, very good water use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just to review everything I said,
apples have an interesting characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that they, if you look at the
response to BPD, you see two different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of responses under very low stress
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many cases potted trees or growing
in very, very low stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In England, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find that the stomal conductance at
very humid conditions, low BPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: can go up very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomates can open up very wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the field, we see the blue markers
down below where it will drop off at the
[SPEAKER_00]: high BPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they really don't respond to that low
BPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't open up nearly as much as
they normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: These data are actually from the same
branch on the same tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: About three days apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is stress, they will behave like
the blue markers where they don't respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three days of very humid,
overcast, drizzly conditions, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: black markers show that they can open up
very widely under low stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about two, three days later,
under normal conditions again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have gone back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a set response.
It's a very dynamic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have some thoughts on why that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really have time to go into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stomal response to BPD is quite
unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think, the way we're interpreting
that is that basically, the green line
[SPEAKER_00]: just shows that there's a limit due to the
humidity on the opening of the stomates.
Perhaps the peristominal transpiration is
limiting the opening of the green line.
But in the field, we have a second
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a limitation imposed by the
coupling of the stomates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I showed earlier,
if we girdled the chute and the
photosynthesis dropped by 80%,
the stomates close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under those conditions where you have
low photosynthesis, and it could be due to
[SPEAKER_00]: like a very low crop load, accumulation of
carbohydrates, the photosynthesis goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down, then you get almost no response at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in many cases, we may see varying
responses, but we think there's two
[SPEAKER_00]: interacting limits to this model opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will come back later with some
modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing is the reduction of leaf
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples don't really, they don't really
excise the leaves.
They don't drop the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in most cases, what it does is it
stops producing new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by stop producing new leaves and
retain old leaves, there's some real
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages in that you're not constantly
having to build new leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the respiration rates of apple trees,
we've used old canopy blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle of summer, the
respiration on a sunny day, if it fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 grams of carbohydrates, or CO2,
at night it may only respire five to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very low respiration value because
they're not producing a lot of new tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to make that work, those old leaves
have to be able to be productive for many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is another unusual thing with
apple is that this plot shows the sperm
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned earlier they come out at the
beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out and they were first measured
at the end of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically their photosynthesis rate
didn't change until the middle of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go out at this time of year,
you can see these long shoots that have
leaves produced by every two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have different ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all will give the same photosynthesis
rate conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a very, very slow turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stay in almost complete dark for
two weeks, take off the shades,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll still be green.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple hours of acclimation to
light, they will have closer to normal
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaves on the interior don't really
fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an interesting combination between
water relations and carbohydrate energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the radiation absorbed in
relationship to the leaf area,
and as I mentioned, the leaves,
it doesn't drop leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the characteristics that it does do
is that the exterior leaves that are
exposed to highlight fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're exposed to highlight and
additional dropship, or stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: they fold even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some where the margins
almost touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fold it up so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is it reduces the energy
load on that individual leaf.
But of course those leaves are out in the
full sun normally, so that they're really
not short of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can still photosensitize at pretty
much their maximum rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does is it allows light to be
penetrating into the canopy where the
[SPEAKER_00]: interior leaves are flatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lower the light, the flatter the
leaf takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course they're growing in low
light, so any additional light that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get is used very efficiently.
So it does seem that it should be
increasing the water use efficiency of the
whole canopy, though not necessarily
reducing the total light interception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apple tends to tend to be the type that
is not so conservative because it retains
[SPEAKER_00]: those old leaves, keeps them functional,
and it doesn't drop leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really reduce its water loss
dramatically as the other plants with the
[SPEAKER_00]: shutdown and drop leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sort of toughs out the moderate
droughts.
So I know a report that said in really dry
conditions, apples are considered very
[SPEAKER_00]: drought-sensitive because they can't make
it through two to three months of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where other things like grape will just
shut down, drop leaves, and will get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in shorter droughts, they can stay
more productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that seems to be their match.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect that I mentioned was the
maintenance of water uptake by increased
[SPEAKER_00]: root conductivity or reducing the
resistance of that root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apple root systems have a relatively
high hydraulic resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they aren't able to adjust that in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: A study from my first student,
Fred Davies, where we had potted apple
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, three-year-old trees that we kept
in a very humid glass house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very low battery demand conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put half of them out in a gravel
lot area where it was much hotter and
drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after several weeks, we noticed that
when we took water potential readings of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, and in those two conditions,
they had the same value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're under dramatically
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought them together and estimated
the resistance of the top and the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the tops didn't really
change their hydraulic resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the root changed by about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it was out in the dry conditions,
root resistance decreased, allowing a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher conductivity for the water and
actually maintained the water potential at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is, when I talk to
colleagues in Israel and Ireland and all
[SPEAKER_00]: over, a well-watered tree in the middle of
summer, they all tend to give about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same water potentials, even though they're
living at quite dramatically different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a quite strong effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anatomically, or visually, we could not
see the difference between these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a matter of growing a lot of
young white roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look basically identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of another way of maintaining
trigger is osmotic adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that apples do quite
strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've found that we can go up to two and a
half megapascals or 25 bars of osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a dry season, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a very good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about a week to get maybe three
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a long response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we started looking at it,
we found that if you look at the osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of the shoots, the mature leaves
basically all have a quite low osmotic
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shoot tips have a much higher,
much less osmotic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the season, we found that the
shoot tips did not change in their water
potential.
So this makes those extension shoots that
are growing, those shoot tips don't
osmoticly adjust.
So they respond correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the change in the water potential with
a drying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the mature leaves do osmoticly
adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this allows them to maintain
trigger over the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see the mature leaves are
responding to the type of conditions where
[SPEAKER_00]: the grown shoot tips basically are not
osmoticly adjusting at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives support for the older leaves
and keeps the trigger and the water status
[SPEAKER_00]: of the older leaves better so they can be
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, of course, depends on them being
able to be productive all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of makes a coherent picture
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study from England where they
looked at trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that on the bottom of the
osmotic, the solid lines are irrigated and
[SPEAKER_00]: the dash were non-irrigated, drop stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the osmotic potentials
were relatively high early and then went
[SPEAKER_00]: down from about 15 or 16 down to about 35
and extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about a 20 bar adjustment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the water potential was gradually
going down also.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference then is the trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that basically over the
season that the osmotic adjustment was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to maintain the trigger both for the
non-irrigated ones that went up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also for the stressed ones that were
able to maintain the trigger.
So osmotic adjustment is I think a very
useful tool for the plant that has this
type of response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned the roots and their hydraulic
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apple roots, especially in the modern
orchards, they're not growing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings in the big root systems.
Our modern orchards are using dwarf stalks
that keep the plants maybe two meters or
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes less in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have root systems that you see
in this picture can actually extend quite
a ways, but they're not intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of studies have been done that
find that the root link density of apples
[SPEAKER_00]: varies from zero but up to about 0.5 or so
on an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some values of 0.3 where they've
got some data from corn, there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants even higher that they can go up to
30 centimeters per cubic centimeter of
soil.
So the implications of this is one is that
if you have one root growing up an apple
and you have a hundred roots of corn or a
thousand roots of grass growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same volume, the grass is gonna win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grass between the row,
you don't get a lot of apple roots growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in that stuff, in that grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to grow in the other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has a new patient for
practical growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grapes are very similar.
They will try to avoid the competition of
grasses in cover crops.
Now, because of the high hydraulic
conductivity, there's a very strong
relationship between leaf water potential
and the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the intercepted zero transpiration is
basically the soil and water potential on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can go up and down a few bars,
but the strongest effect is the
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that, then on the right you
can see there's quite a strong diurnal
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern in the water potential of the
apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go down to, this is older data
from Landsberg, about 16 to 20 bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a well water, that's not a
problem for them because of their osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this very strong diurnal
pattern.
The other implication of the low root
length density, and this was calculated by
[SPEAKER_00]: Landsberg, Jones from the Gardner model,
is that as the soil dries out,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere resistance will tend to go
up much more rapidly with low root length
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you look at the,
estimates for apple water use in the
field, estimates are something like,
we have at 80, maybe even 90% of the
amount that grass uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 80% of ETO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have an, the apple trees are
using almost the same amount of water as
[SPEAKER_00]: the grass, but they're taking it up with
maybe one 100th or one 500th as many
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got very few roots that have to
take up a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the middle of the day,
when they have a very high transpiration
rate, the calculations suggest that there
should be a significant localized drying
around the root system.
And there's actually some information,
some data from Spain where they put on
[SPEAKER_00]: 150% of ET, and they got a very high
increased growth, and they had less
[SPEAKER_00]: negative mid-day water potentials than if
they just put on 100% of ET at night
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rhizosphere depended only on the
hydraulic conductivity of the soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think because of that low root
length density, that we're having a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant rhizosphere increase in
resistance in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes some of these estimations
from modeling more difficult when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that other component being variable as
well as the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the other mention was maintenance of
water uptake by increased root density or
[SPEAKER_00]: depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results of this have been very,
really variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, there has been a little bit
of increase, as this plot from Joe shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that the pink dotted line are the checks,
and the other two are different stress
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, similar response, where they tend
to have somewhat less roots in the very
[SPEAKER_00]: top layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle zone, they had
somewhat more roots and then lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't seem to make much difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't seem to push them deeper,
but they did have somewhat more in that
[SPEAKER_00]: middle zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other studies have found basically no
real response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't seem to be a major
mechanism for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I talked about some of the practical
implications, things like estimated water
[SPEAKER_00]: use for irrigation, how it really might
affect those things, and also how we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually go about measuring those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did work with student Motan Lee on the
physiology of summer pruning, and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: when typically around the first of August
or so, you go out, if you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, the apple through the red ones,
essentially, need direct sunlight to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: good red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there may be too much shade,
and so the growers will go in and cut out
[SPEAKER_00]: long shoots that are grown away,
and they can cut out quite a bit of leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually estimated, we followed some
growers, they were doing some rather
[SPEAKER_00]: severe summer pruning, and they actually
removed between 40 and 50% of the leaf
area to give the fruit as well as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did take a look at that using
our whole canopy gas exchange systems that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've used for several studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the canopy transpiration
was reduced by that summer pruning,
pretty much in proportion to the amount of
big area removed.
Not a one-to-one pruning, but a linear
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after we did the summer pruning,
we looked at the stem water potentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first columns on the left were just
before the summer pruning, nice sunny day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stem water potential, see they're
basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later in the day after the summer
pruning, we did it again and found about a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-bar adjustment of reduction in the
level of stress, the slight difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there was a difference
caused by that, and then about a week
[SPEAKER_00]: later, the difference was still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways, this may give the
opportunity to try to reduce somewhat the
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a compromise, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a heavy crop, you don't want
to take up too much leaf area,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you want the other size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a lower crop, it's not
limited by the amount of leaf area
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis you're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be an opportunity to gain hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's usually not used for that
purpose, where we have seen it can affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, in many cases, wanted to understand
how much water may use to guide irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: for our growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, we found that it seemed
like we were irrigating more than we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the real question is, how do you
estimate the water use of apples in our
particular climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're not in California or
Washington, where they developed the
[SPEAKER_00]: estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's hard to estimate that
from soil moisture, because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: variable root distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to try to understand how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the general approach is to
use a peppermint motif equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for agricultural crops, usually,
the approach is to have a reference plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a reference grass, or alfalfa,
something like that, and use the model of
[SPEAKER_00]: the peppermint motif for that reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your crop has a fraction of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the crop coefficient,
or Kc, is the fraction of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works OK in places like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works OK when we have days that are
like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't seem to work very well in
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, shockingly, grass is not
a very good model of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, we need to take a
look at this a little bit more detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that we're over-irrigating in
using that crop coefficient approach from
[SPEAKER_00]: aerosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found we were over-irrigating in cool
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out the ETO is very,
very strongly independent of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the ETO and plotted against
radiation, it's 93% R squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't have a very strong response
to temperature or humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cases where we would have very cool
humid conditions but sunny, we would get a
[SPEAKER_00]: high ETO, but we'd get low water use by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we realized that with tall,
rough structures, that we needed to look
[SPEAKER_00]: into how are they actually responding to
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there was some theoretical study
that suggested that crop coefficients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are developed in aerosomes may not work
correctly in humid zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at an orchard and with the
grass in between, you can see that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass down below, there's a heavy boundary
layer, especially in orchards and
[SPEAKER_00]: vineyards where you have a windbreak about
every three meters or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is that you have a
boundary layer that basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the humidity comes out of the plant
and the stoma is open, it basically tracks
[SPEAKER_00]: that humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the stoma is open, the BPD goes
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they basically cancel each other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they're pretty much just
dependent on the radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case with the apple tree in
that because of the rough structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's very, very good airflow around the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any humidity comes out of a leaf,
it's immediately mixed with the bulk air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the stomatal opening makes the
difference and the radiation is the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, of course, and the inherent BPD in
the bulk air makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two systems are being controlled by
a different combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to actually go take a look,
but we wanted to be able to measure it
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used sap flow gauges, but we didn't
trust them to make all the estimations of
[SPEAKER_00]: wound factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our student, Danila Grigoni,
did a study with using sap flow gauges,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we installed them and then we
calibrated them with the whole canopy gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange for several days and then removed
the gas exchange G version that after
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrating them left until we
re-calibrated later in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way we could get a really direct
measurement, accurate measurement,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without disturbing the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did that, we found this is the
actual crop coefficient or the fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: ETL.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time of the season,
it should be something like constant 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that's not really not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some days up here that were hot
and dry and nice, like California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there were some days that were cool
and humid but sunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the high ETL but lower use by the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we could see that we
really couldn't use the crop coefficients
[SPEAKER_00]: from arid climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we developed our own apple-specific
and monotone equations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, we had to change for
the boundary layer and other factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did use this unique model
conductance where in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance versus the evaporative demand,
the EPD, it goes down with the very dry
conditions, but it plants out and in the
more moderate humid conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could not make the measured data fit
the model until we put that unusual
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance relationship in there,
and then we did get a good relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model then was put onto the
website of the Northeast Climate Center
[SPEAKER_00]: with ARDS and PEAP put on, and it
calculates water balance for the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: using the data from the Duval Weather
Stations.
So it's been put into use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned that water status
strongly affects many factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, can be used for the census,
but it also reduces chute growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we implied from the lack of
adjustment of the chute tips, the chute
[SPEAKER_00]: growth rate is pretty much linearly
reduced by stress, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: we use stem water potential as the best
integrative measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also fruit growth rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit tends to have a little bit of
adjustment and then it drops off with more
[SPEAKER_00]: severe stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these have a very strong effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water stress then has this strong effect
on growth and the canopy and the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, how do we deal with that
variability that we talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a strong transpiration
effect, as we've shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil variation can cause some
variation there, but the weather patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big effect on the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that there's temporal
variation going on, very dynamic and
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our crazy weather, you can imagine how
variable it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spatial, also, many orchards are not in
the most uniform soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are, but maybe on hills or you have
in areas where you get spatial variation
[SPEAKER_00]: in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of physiological
development and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to model all that to estimate
what the actual water stress is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is something that's really very
difficult and it's obviously best to just
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since, as I mentioned, the water
status of the plant depends on so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these parameters and treatments,
soil water availability and where the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are and where the soil water is and
what the soil water content versus water
[SPEAKER_00]: potential in these curves looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not just measure it correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, we have done that for
many, many years using the Schrodinger
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure chamber or we call it the
pressure bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get good data, but it's very slow and
very limited data because of the manual
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be some significant operator
errors and it can lead to operator pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, lumbar four or five
can take a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, after doing this for
three years or about 30 at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, we've got to come up with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to somehow get this pressure
bomb thing into some type of sensor that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can stick inside the plant and get
continuous reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sit back with our feet up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I contacted Abe Strucke in chemistry
engineering who's working on physics of
[SPEAKER_00]: water and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, well, the conventional
soil tensiometer has a very good basic
[SPEAKER_00]: physical principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we could just turn that big one
into a little chip that we could make a
[SPEAKER_00]: micro version of that and then be able to
do concerted into the trunk or use it as
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and then be able to get minute by
minute data of the water steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Abe and Vinay Phogay, a member was
a grad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first one to work with us on
that, a joint horticulture chem
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was followed up after he left by
Apple Santiago who had really developed it
[SPEAKER_00]: further as a practical tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then C.U.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ju working with Abe is doing a lot of
the testing now in Apple and also in corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're interested in seeing how that
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sensor itself is a sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, there's a water reservoir in
there, but tiny, eight nanoliters,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pressure transducer to measure the
change in pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's an exchange surface that
you can see on the right, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: frostbite silicon with nanometer type two
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, we have a very,
very large range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal tensiometer got one bar less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours will go, we had one go over 300 bars
of stress, but a hundred is sort of
standard.
So we got a huge range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the chip is mounted into a
cylindrical probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there next to the dime with
the chip on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, this shows a little bit easier in
the top left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the chip on the edge there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drill a hole with a guide and a special
end mill bit to give a flat hole at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prototype of a way to hold it to
the tree, but there's a group that
[SPEAKER_00]: developed further and some nice ways of
installing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a study from a couple years
ago when we had a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the sensors in the
apple tree, that's before all the
[SPEAKER_00]: installation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to do a lot of installation over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a very cloudy day, you can see the
red line is the radiation and the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: water potential is buffered a little bit
by the response time of the sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot seems to be a lot by the tree
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a coincidence that probably
buffers out this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see the type of data that
we gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does correlate well with the pressure
bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except occasionally we'll get a mid,
early morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be kind of a spike if you'll do a
sap flow gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spike due to rapid changes in
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to, we do have a temperature
sensor on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study that's to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done with an apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the pattern within the
blue line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pressure bond values are the
orange dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is looking like the dreams
coming true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do to get this actually available
to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a microelectrical mechanical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is not something that most industry
companies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that do it aren't interested in
these types of applications.
So we set up a small startup and Michael
Santiago is taking the lead on that.
But we're making a lot of really good
progress on that.
I'm getting that available.
Probably the first sales will be next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting pretty excited about it
actually being available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I'd like to acknowledge a
lot of the people, especially on the left,
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrence Robinson, a colleague for 30 some
odd years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of work with irrigation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just work to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two nations, graduate students is not
going to put them all up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the different sources.
Funding.
But I really have to make a pitch for
hatch and basic state funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nobody wants to pay for water
relations studies in this kind of climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even say, well, why are you studying
water relations in this climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, in California, when they
irrigate, they never have drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plants always get the water
they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, if we don't have rain, we get
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot more drought stress than
they do in places that irrigate always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think over the years it's actually
been very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's actually some useful
things to come out of this type of study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
