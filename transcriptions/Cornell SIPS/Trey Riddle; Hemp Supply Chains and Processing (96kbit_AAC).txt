[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like our numbers have stabilized
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having another session here of the
hemp webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Bahia Zal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watched the previous one,
hello again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a second year PhD student here in
plant breeding at Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: studying hemp with Dr. Larry Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for your information, these webinars
are being recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to refer back to these
and share these with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hosted on our Cornell School of
Integrative Plant Sciences YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put the link in the chat and they'll
be posted pretty soon afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. David Suchoff's talk is already up
there if you want to go back and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for our admin and media team
for helping put this together and get
[SPEAKER_00]: those videos edited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim Paul and Craig Kramer, big thanks to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can find more hemp resources on
our Cornell hemp website, which I'll also
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a reminder for everyone, if you have
questions for the speaker, please put
[SPEAKER_00]: those in the Q&A box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the talk, the speaker
will go through those and he'll try to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to chat with each other,
you can do that through the chat function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And joining us again, I'd like to welcome
our speaker, Trey Riddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Riddle has experience working as an
engineer, a manager, and as an executive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an entrepreneur that has founded and
run several businesses as well as built
[SPEAKER_00]: factories and written research
publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recently, he's gained a lot of
experience in biofiber manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilization at IND Hemp, which is an
American industrial scale hemp fiber and
[SPEAKER_00]: grain processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, he is the chief strategy officer
overseeing sales, marketing, and finance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his PhD at Montana State University
and his master's at Cornell in mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Trey, for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you get started with your talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you so much for the
introduction and the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: From around the world, saw the chat there
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty exciting to have some folks coming
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I've been asked to speak a little
bit about the hemp supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to talk for just a minute right
here about the goodness of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am from IND Hemp, and this is a
slogan that we like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goodness of hemp means a lot to us and
the people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something we really want to promote is how
can we make things better?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we make them good with hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of an ethos that we live
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as an outline where we're going to
go today, I'll talk for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 to 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really am looking forward to having
the Q&A and understanding what your guys'
[SPEAKER_01]: questions are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lot more meaningful if I
can address those specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll start by talking a little bit
about IND Hemp so you know who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The meat will come in as we talk about
coordinating the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at that in the lens of three
different sectors, agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: processing, and then markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend a little bit of time on lessons
learned and bottlenecks and opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: and strategic initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis Huchoff did a great job last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am less prepared than him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he gives a lot of talks as a
professor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope you guys stick with me and what
I say is relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why we got the Q&A to be sure
that you get what you want out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about IND Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a family-owned and operated
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Elliott's founded us several years
ago, originally looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: phytoremediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken is a geologist that worked in
Superfund sites around the world and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how to clean up those
sites by traditional means as a career.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then post that career, started getting
interested in hemp as a phytoremediator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually owns an older phytoremediator.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the binary side in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then actually found out about the
great things happening just across the
[SPEAKER_01]: border in Canada around grain and the need
for alternatives in our farmland here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Montana specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the applicability of what was
happening in grain up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IND Hemp actually started as a hemp
grain company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken convinced his daughter Morgan to join
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: She came from the other side, the dark
side from ADM, Archer Daniels Midland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where she was a chemical engineer there
working in large corn and soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: processing facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she came over to have some fun with
us here at IND Hemp and founded IND Hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really take our ethos seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: People, planet, and profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much in that order.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see on the screen here is a
picture of Fort Benton, Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I am today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Central Montana in the prime growing
region, what we call the Golden Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Called the Golden Triangle because so much
wheat is grown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fort Benton was sort of a pioneer town.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how Montana and much of the Pacific
Northwest was settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: The steamships would come up the Missouri,
the Mississippi River to the Missouri
[SPEAKER_01]: River.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically couldn't get any farther
than Fort Benton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of history here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great spot to pioneer hemp as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A town of 1,300, 1,400 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily supported by agriculture and
then a little bit by tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having our infrastructure here is really
meaningful to the town and to the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both in terms of employing folks directly
into the company, but then also supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage in the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really live behind that to be
supportive of our people and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think what we're doing here,
as I hope everybody on the call does,
[SPEAKER_01]: is meaningful in that we're looking at new
ways to implement agricultural solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of the world's problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be that food or non-sustainable materials
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our vision, our mission as a company
really has a lot to do with the talk
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is connecting that innovators at the
agricultural level with the pioneers in
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what this value chain is
all about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is how do we go from a commodity off the
farm to something that a consumer can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of dots to get
connected to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody has to be rewarded and see
value along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our vision is really to create a
supply chain that's profitable and
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really do value and lean on our
personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for
other folks in this industry and other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries caring about what we're doing
and engaging and actually come back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that a little bit at the end of this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how meaningful that can be in building
viable supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty diversified in hemp space.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in the industrial hemp space that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do anything in CBD at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our product lines are hemp seed foods,
hemp feed in animal supplements,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives a pretty diversified portfolio
of activity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to support diversity on the farm as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make a shout out here to a
gentleman Pierre Berard that we had the
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasure of working with over the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has written a report and published it
on his website, BioSolutions Initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage everybody to go take a look at
the report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's free and it's an amazing
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grabbed a number of his images
and whatnot because I think they speak
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to some of the conversation
that's happening here around supply chains
[SPEAKER_01]: and how we can make viable lasting supply
chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit of plagiarism,
but I worked really close with Pierre on
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he uncovered some really
important lessons on how we can make this
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the report out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check his website out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we'll talk about today is the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in essence, what is really needed is a
coordinated supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do this in a bubble individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at every level of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to say that we're not really
building, we're not building just a
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing that from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really results in integrated and
dependent supply chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, they're also pretty
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And presently a bit fledgling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still a little bit immature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this graphic does a decent job of
showing how the foundation is the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there can be a lot of farmers that
might support a limited amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: processors, which then go on to support
brands and consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these supply chains start regionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they become nationally and then
even international to some degree,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure, as we look at the growing US
industry supporting exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really the foundation is at the
farm level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say it starts on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our fields here,
one of our farmers, Dale Flickema.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fiber crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an Asian variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember which one on the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably Yunma or Hanmi, one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it starts on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the foundation of these supply
chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So agronomy and production is critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more than that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at IND Hemp, we've actually grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've contracted for over 30,000 acres to
date over the last five years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, it's about 50% organic on our
grain side of the business, not as much on
[SPEAKER_01]: the fiber side there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of growing pains into what
that means to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still more to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, fundamentally,
I think these are sort of self-truths that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody probably knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to reiterate here, there's got to
be a market for the farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer needs a buyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And spot buying is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we saw some travesties in
the early days of industrial hemp around
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other commodities as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, the farmer's
got to sell their products just like
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else has to sell their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to have contracts that are
meaningful to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those contracts really need to
encourage some support.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmers need a viable production
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different on where you are and what
you're growing for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's an understated need for
the product processor, the buyer,
[SPEAKER_01]: to help your participants in that support
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have agronomists on staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think he puts something
ridiculous, like 40,000 miles,
[SPEAKER_01]: windshield time, just driving around to
our farms repeatedly throughout the year,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's in the early information
stages of what our contracts look like
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to their other alternatives,
to making sure the seeds are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: planted right, and fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And harvesting is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we do both grain and fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually at the point now where
we provide harvesting services,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially, cutting, raking, and baling
for the straw, considering it's 12 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a need that arose out of
maybe a lack of experience with hemp as a
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber crop and a lack of tools,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the right tools?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is one farmer going to buy that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's very challenging for them to
buy a specialized cutter if they're only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow 40 or 250 acres,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We leverage what we can from traditional
implements, but we found is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty necessary, both for having the
right tool for the job, but then also
[SPEAKER_01]: managing the right timing and practices
for the harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at any rate, farmers need a viable
production model so they know they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need the right seeds at the right
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also, I think, an understated need
for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all seeds are created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are good in some areas,
climate and soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are good in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are good for, obviously,
for grain applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are good for fiber applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some are just too dang expensive
to make the whole model work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is still a need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've identified a couple that we
focus on that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, in those metrics
for our models, it's going to be different
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody and every place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proximity matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is sort of obvious as well,
but it's most critical for straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: The transportation costs for straw bales
can get expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grain is a little more flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move grain a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a map of some of our farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're located here in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do a little bit in Idaho,
Washington, and Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get further away, up to maybe 400
miles away, those are almost exclusively
[SPEAKER_01]: grain contracts, whereas the straw is
quite a bit closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you think about traditional
commodities, grain elevators are every
[SPEAKER_01]: county has a grain elevator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not at that scale yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as processing infrastructure,
the transportation costs and the support
[SPEAKER_01]: system has got to be regional in nature
for the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only does that need to take into
account the farm conditions and the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: economics and climate, soil conditions,
infrastructure, all those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it also needs to consider the regional
markets and hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's also a cost to getting to
market and there's an ease of getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So logistics, both from the farm to a
processor, but from a processor to market
[SPEAKER_01]: all need to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may drive decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our decisions should really start
at the market level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's buying something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they need it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much will that pay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then work that way down the value
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually has a place at the farm
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality and cost and proximity are all
factors there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at out of agriculture and into
that next level of supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: processing, we can look at a couple of
different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first level is primary processing,
primary agricultural processing or first
[SPEAKER_01]: tier processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at IND hemp, like I said,
we do both fiber and grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are fairly significant
infrastructure investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left is the fiber facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 52,000 square feet plus about
8,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about 8 acres of outside storage
for the decortication and milling,
[SPEAKER_01]: classifying, and packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the grain side, we've got
about 17,000 square feet where we have
[SPEAKER_01]: grain cleaning, crushing, deholing,
and milling, and packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the role here of the first touch
processor, obviously, is to take that raw
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural goods and convert them into
more of a value added ag product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may still be an ingredient or it
could be a finished good, possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: depending.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is more centralized processing
with larger investments to achieve some
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of folks at the farm level,
farmers that have invested in technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: they can implement in their barns or shops
or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a different style of
processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, I think there are
opportunities for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That more distributed processing
infrastructure to get more value into the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's always that duality of scale,
economics, capital investment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've seen time and time again farm to
table being successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For hemp, it's a little bit more
challenging than, say, for cattle or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that where there's large
buyer infrastructure out there of
[SPEAKER_01]: slaughtered meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where we landed is to
centralize processing large scales to do
[SPEAKER_01]: value add to the raw goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because scale matters from our
perspective to get to those economies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, while the industry will
beg, borrow, and steal from other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries, the hemp industry will use
equipment that had a different purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been for textile processing
or it might have been for soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: processing or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But almost always, these are purpose-built
systems that have been engineered for
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that means the systems level where
you just put the right pieces of the
[SPEAKER_01]: puzzle together or you modified one piece
of equipment to do a thing, there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of success in one turnkey off the
shelf piece of equipment to do what you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to that systems
engineering component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I think that a lot of people
don't consider as much as we should on the
[SPEAKER_01]: front end of getting into the processing
business is packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of our goals as processors in that
intermediary between the farm and the
[SPEAKER_01]: markets to ensure we have adoption,
we need to be able to give the market
[SPEAKER_01]: something that they can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that comes down to the
performance of the material or
[SPEAKER_01]: compatibility of the manufacturing or
whatever of that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, packaging has a big role in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a buyer that's buying
whatever, soybean meal or talc in a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain packaging format, and you're
asking them to switch to hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's already one ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're asking them to switch to a
different packaging unit, that's another
[SPEAKER_01]: ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can be challenging,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we should attempt to minimize the
hardship on the buyers if they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch from an incumbent material to hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll just make it easier for us to
get into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing in our systems is trying to be
automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we minimize the touch points?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we ensure quality control and move
as fast as possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is pushing as much material through lines
as possible to get the cost down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And automation becomes a big deal for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then quality as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think quality relates to performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got to be competitive with the
other items on the market to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other piece to this middle ground
between end markets and consumers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: raw materials are what I'll call
converters, which are second tier
[SPEAKER_01]: processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are groups that might buy
decorticated fiber from a deportication
[SPEAKER_01]: line, or they might buy protein from a
seed mill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is these guys need love,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need reasons to switch to hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also need opportunities as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this can cover anything from
non-woven lines making felts to feed mills
[SPEAKER_01]: for cattle or spinning mills for textiles,
pulp mills for paper, food manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: and co-manufacturers, composite
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is probably not talked about as
much as I think it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the reality is we might not be
able to deliver something that is a 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: drop in replacement to the incumbent
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do these converters need to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we need new converters that may be a
hemp specific spinning mill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the challenge all the spinning
mills out there today have spent 100 years
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing around short staple cotton or
wool or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we need new infrastructure that can
be focused on hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a valid question and likely a
valid need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there is infrastructure out there
today that we'd like to see adopt hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the other piece of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they need investment and they need
support as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in many cases, those companies are
interested because they're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: more market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can take time and take a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are giant markets as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking about hundreds of
billions of dollars for these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: not that hemp would have billions of
dollars opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people might say it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is just that there's a lot
of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of prerogatives that are
happening now that are driving the desire,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's for more sustainable
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think one of the goals is to try to
find the places where there is growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What market is growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to penetrate a growing market
and sort of feed off the growth rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than a declining or stagnant market where
you're a true replacement to existing
[SPEAKER_01]: materials and infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up some questions about how
do you go to market, I think, in that
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain and what are the markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one thing I think that we found
that was successful is to look at vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes that needs a supply chain
partner to get that over the goal line,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that's through contract
manufacturing to make a salad dressing or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever out of your hemp oil or whatnot,
or a non-woven mat for erosion control,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of times we can't do all that
in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be a finished branded
product which is what we've done in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases is develop in consumer products,
primarily in the animal space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a place where we found success,
whether that's through bedding or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional and supplement products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the benefit of doing that is balancing
that lower margin, large scale B2B
[SPEAKER_01]: adoption with higher margin finished
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that is a whole nother level of
operational needs for the company to
[SPEAKER_01]: integrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, both are critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sort of that large scale B2B
bulk sales are necessary to achieve the
[SPEAKER_01]: economies of scale so that we can actually
make the stuff at an affordable price,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then the finished goods enable us to
capture some more of the margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually needed partners to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we launched in that space with a local
retailer in Montana and Idaho called North
[SPEAKER_01]: 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they kind of helped direct us on
what a brand might look like and what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the packaging units on the store shelves?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the other opportunities
or other options out there that we'd have
[SPEAKER_01]: an opportunity to support or replace?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that customer buy-in was extremely
critical, that customer discovery,
[SPEAKER_01]: and us making decisions to launch our
first branded product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, we've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've grown beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having that partner on the front end
was really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely something we found
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody else would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sort of led to us developing two
different branded lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a farm and ranch line called
Hemptana and then a pet line called
[SPEAKER_01]: Allwalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that way we have different similar
products, different packaging formats or
[SPEAKER_01]: sizes, different markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pet would go into specialty pet stores
like Petco or PetSmart and farmer ranch
[SPEAKER_01]: into tractor supply type stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that kind of came
along with this is this required us to
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously invest in packaging
infrastructure, but also brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that should be understated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things we also do is we
utilize that infrastructure and that
[SPEAKER_01]: know-how to do private label for others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a way to diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our operational needs and revenue
opportunities and support other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: in the process as well to get their brands
out there or to support their region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really do it all ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in the future we'll see
more distributed manufacturing come
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to talk a little bit about what
do we really think we can achieve here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemp industry, what that means and how
we get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I think is worth sort of
mentioning here is the countries that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the larger hemp cropping acreage,
for one thing or the other, they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: ban production or they restarted earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so China never having banned
production, they're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is data from 2020, but it's not
terribly different in 2022, but China in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 160,000 acre range France and Canada,
they restarted earlier, France in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1960s and Canada in the late 90s of
reinvigorating their hemp opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's sort of telling,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, France started in the 60s and
they're looking at 46,000 acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada late 90s and 55,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, 20, 25 years, I mean, 60 years,
these are long time, frames to get to what
[SPEAKER_01]: arguably in the scale of agricultural
commodities, isn't that many acres,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's some questions out
in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we look at this data as well,
how can we do it faster?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we do it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we do more?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get more value, more demand for
hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to do that, it's kind of
necessary that we look at some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other supply chains that were built and
figure out what we can learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're complicated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it covers an enormous amount
for a new industry like hemp, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an enormous amount of touch points,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether that's at the farm level,
the processor specialized equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: logistics, you know, there's storage,
I mean, R&D, genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just, it's a very complicated
industry that really needs coordination
[SPEAKER_01]: and it also needs capital at different
stages of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, you know, think about that and
say, okay, well, it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of moving, you know,
factors, a lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we expedite success and reduce that
investment costs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's impaired that we look at
other countries and we look at other
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is actually what the report
that Pierre put out there did a good job
[SPEAKER_01]: of spelling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next few slides here, I'll kind of
grab some stuff from him, make sure I give
[SPEAKER_01]: him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're, it's really good
information that not everybody's aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start with France.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, France started in the
sixties, you know, there are 50,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: or so about, you know, now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably have the most
diversified industrial hemp value chains
[SPEAKER_01]: as related to products and markets in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: China, you know, almost exclusively
textiles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, almost exclusively grain and food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas France has a lot more diversity,
but it took 50 years for them to get
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you in spending some time
with one of the larger processes over
[SPEAKER_01]: there, it took them 18 years to get to
breakeven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are pretty sobering,
you know, sobering remarks, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should all consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we learn from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do we, how do we accelerate
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, we might not have the
appetite, you know, or the ability to last
[SPEAKER_01]: that long for some of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things in France is they had
cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every, pretty much every hemp industry
member in France is part of a cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ensured farmer buy-in in the
prudent progressive development to create
[SPEAKER_01]: value to the farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't work for the farm,
it doesn't work for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't work for anybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But farmers have a lot of other options,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of other things they can
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's the foundation that we have
to build on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having their buy-in at the beginning,
is extremely useful in ensuring that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a sustainable and stable,
sustainable supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, several groups of processors
came together to pool resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and to invest in activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that was with external
partners, but they sort of aligned and
[SPEAKER_01]: said, hey, like, we all got some of the
same problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should work together on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have some of the same
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe we should work together on
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a challenge, I think, for us to let
our guards down, but it could be one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most instrumental ways we can be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also buoyed by favorable
government relation or regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in France and in the European
Union at large in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allowed the industry to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that is kind of cornerstone
in Europe and specifically in France are
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidies for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out they get about, you know,
anywhere from $60,000 to $76 per acre in
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidies for growing hemp, split between
two different subsidy programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's essentially the bottom
line, the profit margin for a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we obviously don't have
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may never have that in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless, it's good to understand
what some of those levers were in other
[SPEAKER_01]: places and how they're successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should also look at other ag and
agricultural commodities in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of three that sort of stand out in
the last century for growth are cotton,
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar beets, and soybeans as potential
models for how we can build, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton arguably, you know, was the most
successful in garnering government or
[SPEAKER_01]: congressional support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in large part a function of
cotton be the go-to fiber in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the 20th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then synthetic fibers coming around
the mid part of the century, displacing
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous market share for cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government saying, oh boy,
this is a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of farmers growing cotton.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of infrastructure
dedicated to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, an act was actually
passed to support cotton research and
[SPEAKER_01]: promotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Cotton Inc came on board with
really a dual strategy to get that market
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back by both pushing innovations
through by supporting research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development, but then also building
customer demand by advertising,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and pulling through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've seen the Cotton Inc logo and
share in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so dissimilar to Got Milk or
Where's the Beef type of campaigns in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sugar beets is another example where
farmers banded together in associations
[SPEAKER_01]: and cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enabled them to share a lot of
the lessons learned to pool, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the processing infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most, they're almost all
cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even the cooperatives joined
together in a cooperative to form,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, United Sugar and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they achieved some stability there
and their ability to present a more
[SPEAKER_01]: unified source of supply, you know,
and saying, well, we're not just one
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an association of members that
retain their own ownership, but come
[SPEAKER_01]: together to market our products kind of
collectively into the space so that big
[SPEAKER_01]: users, big buyers of sugar can see sugar
beets as a solution for large market
[SPEAKER_01]: share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean is another thing that took 50
years to become firmly established in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that is credited to,
you know, two federated entities,
[SPEAKER_01]: the United Soy Board and the American
Soybean Association that were able to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at their membership's needs, find dollars
to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we see the advent of checkoffs
and whatnot at the farm level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there again, that has bred innovation
in developing new products from soy and
[SPEAKER_01]: soy oil and soy meal and understanding,
you know, the nutritional value of meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all that, you know, cooperative
working together for the benefit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire industry really showed a lot of
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sort of distill some of that down
into some lessons learned for our supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain, you know, based on those other
learnings that representative associations
[SPEAKER_01]: were critical, whether that was in France
for hemp or these other ag commodities in
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federating the Farmers and the Growers
Association seems to have been a very
[SPEAKER_01]: successful methodology as well to help
stabilize the growing region, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: diversify, you know, the supply chain from
more than one farmer, but everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: working together to ensure, you know,
that there is a supply and the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: that supply and even sharing the cost of
some of the implements or investments in
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to get that done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then coordinating farmers and
processors from research and development
[SPEAKER_01]: from universities and private firms,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there again, not working in a bubble,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what is meaningful to farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you heard from David Shearer,
a lot of the research happening there were
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in a program to look at microbial
activity to boost redding on hemp straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a place where industry and
farmers stand to gain a lot, but we need
[SPEAKER_01]: universities to do that, you know,
a lot of that groundbreaking work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generating political support, the state
and federal levels, that's really hit and
[SPEAKER_01]: miss, you know, so far in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of diversity in our
goals and a lot of diversity in our large
[SPEAKER_01]: country and the needs of any different
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need that support collection
aggregation and sharing to enable
[SPEAKER_01]: traceability and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something obviously the cotton
industry did really well, really USDA did
[SPEAKER_01]: really well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As they developed grading schemes,
they collected data on the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cotton and they developed the methodology
for standardization and specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they developed the traceability
programs that every cotton bale,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, has a tag and it's traceable,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big undertaking, took support of the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not likely to get that kind of
support soon, but things we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, strategic alliances
with industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be looking for pool, like what do
existing industries need and how can we
[SPEAKER_01]: service them?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the industry right now,
the hemp industry, there's some challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, we just did a quick math on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we know about 39, you know,
decortication companies, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: primary straw processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all have different scale,
different equipment, different regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: different products, different
specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a challenge because they're kind
of all 39 of them out there talking to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the same people, a lot of the same
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while, you know, a robust supply
chain that isn't dependent on any one
[SPEAKER_01]: player is critical to show that we can
scale, that's a lot of talking heads out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, talking to the customer
base and potentially confusing them or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, possibly stealing customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and because of that,
there's minimal continuity and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: standard, you know, no real standard
specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a little bit of success lately,
you know, in ASTM and in some building
[SPEAKER_01]: code.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got some, you know, some more work
to do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this is all sort of come
back to that coordinating the value chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, quality matters, but it matters,
you know, to the customer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're not, you know,
producing something that somebody wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
you know, we can talk about hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can talk about sustainability,
but the first two metrics are pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: performance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can be competitive, in pricing
performance, hemp is going to win almost
[SPEAKER_01]: every time on sustainability, you know,
in the other marketing attributes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to solve some of these
problems, we've got to work together to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's understanding that how to
work in that supply chain is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start by, first we have to understand
that value chain, then we need to work on
[SPEAKER_01]: optimizing it, and then we can grow it,
and then we can increase its complexity,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kudos to those folks out there you know,
trying to work on graphing from hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like, maybe there's some lower hanging
fruit out there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to need those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it, but sort of
focusing on basic products and then moving
[SPEAKER_01]: into more value add and highly technical
attributes is a bit of a roadmap that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been trying to, you know,
trying to work on focusing on ready
[SPEAKER_01]: customers for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they importing it from out of the
country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's start there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just change their supply chain from
international, you know, to domestic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's work on characterizing that
production and the raw material,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we can increase it and we can
improve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a stair-step approach to
growing this supply chain together is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably more likely to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to find value, right,
for hemp and starting easy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: start easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that low hanging fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I hate to be cheeky, but you know,
animals pee on bedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that complicated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can move on to more complicated things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are really strong advocates
for hemp as a food, but it's a difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't even know how to pronounce
half these words up here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Albumin and globulin, they're not in my
frozen pizza, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's a lot of work to do
to educate the consumers and the food
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers out there about how powerful
these ingredients can be, but it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated and it takes more time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we have to have this
balanced approach of low hanging fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, an eye to the future, you know,
in more complicated opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess it's a bit of a soapbox,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear you can do 10,000 usages for
hemp, but you know, what are the 100
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll make money?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like in order to have sustainable
business models, we have to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a, you know, really great
map that sort of breaks down entry level
[SPEAKER_01]: projects, you know, products to more
complicated strategic initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beginning to understand this as the
industry will help us chart our path,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, through and prioritize what we
do in the value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these are long games.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're having some really good
success here recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a hemp seed meal for landing
hens is about to be approved by Africa in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big deal and it has taken three
years to get to this point and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people working on it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed hemp to your babies,
but you can't feed it to your chickens or
[SPEAKER_01]: your cattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the long game is important,
but dedicating resources to that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when we participate in that,
we really have to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does it mean for the industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What problem are we trying to solve?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be that in the nutritional profile for a
chicken or in the co-product utilization
[SPEAKER_01]: at the processor level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got a lot of demand for hemp seed
oil, I need to find a place for the meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these things have to go hand in
hand as we look at the market and the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain to ensure that we've got
opportunities for, you know, all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fractions or streams that come off of the
farm and off of the processor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to reduce barriers,
right, for growers, for processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the idea that we still have
to get back around checks for our farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow industrial hemp can be a challenge
getting farmers to grow for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Industrial Hemp Act is an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage you guys to take a look at
this, write your congressmen and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but change the regulations a little bit to
be a little bit more friendly for grain
[SPEAKER_01]: and fiber, because if you've ever seen a
fiber field, it's pretty clear they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing marijuana in there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can tell at a glance that that
is not, you know, not a THC crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of opportunities there as
we look at now more into the optimization
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one of those opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the future is wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, you know, what I'm
talking about here are just sort of ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to help us chart the path, but the
opportunity is a bit endless and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: we all have an opportunity to write our
own stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, we should do that together and
learn lessons where we can as we go and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll head off into the sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my talk, I'll see if I figure out how
to answer some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so first question here, 50% of their
farmers produce organic seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some application differences in
product for organic seeds and non-organic
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be clear, you know,
we would typically refer to this as grain
[SPEAKER_01]: versus planting seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, about 50% of farmers in our farm
activity in the past has been for organic
[SPEAKER_01]: grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does turn out that that straw is
certified organic as well and our
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities are certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our grain cleaning and crushing
facility is certified organic and our
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber processing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can sell the residual straw organic
fiber from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to your question, the applications
aren't terribly different per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of whether or not that
product, that brand wants organic or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, we have a buyer of hemp
seed oil that makes condiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not concerned about it being
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we have another buyer of hemp
seed oil that makes soaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do want it to be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really more that prerogative and
what market share they're going after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Functionally, the product is basically the
same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's a meal for the hemp seed
meal, for the chickens, organic or not
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, just as the brand really want
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the change from like an incumbent
farming practice, you know, I like to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that like, for like fiber, you plant on a
grain model and you harvest on a hay
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably where most of the most of
the differences are going to happen is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in a fiber crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grain crops are pretty similar to
soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your fertilization even isn't that
much different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using seed drills, using combines,
grain dryers, cleaners.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the grain side, it's more of a drop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about, you know, what are the
settings on the combine?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what's your favorite color,
red or green combine?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, you know, what changes do you
maybe have to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you don't have tangling of the
fibers, nuances there, but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: darn similar on the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fiber more challenging where we have
to look at more specialized harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I was talking about
earlier about, you know, maybe a processor
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in those or growers associations
invest in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The direct consumer of, I guess of a
mid-tier processor like us, in some cases
[SPEAKER_01]: is retailers and distributors for our
branded products that go on shelves or on
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon direct to consumer or in the bulk
of it is B2B.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're selling to converters like
a non-woven line or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do all of your hemp farmers that grow for
grain have drying equipment on the farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a requirement for IND hemp grain
farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have grain dryers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Montana is pretty dry, but they do have
like live bins so that we can put air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all, most of them have bins with air
aeration in them where they can dry it
[SPEAKER_01]: down in the bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do ask them to do is pre-clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before they put it in the bin to get
rid of a lot of that chaff that's still in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, full floor aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dalton.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what really helps is to get rid of a
lot of that chaff so that there's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: much moisture going into the bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do ask farmers lots of times to do a
pre-cleaning with like a trommel type of a
[SPEAKER_01]: device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Henry Ford and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know if the new farm bill
addressing industrial hemp issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what those will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you dispose of the dust in your
dust collection systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Keen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, good to see you're still out there in
the hemp space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to give a shout out to Tom
here, because Kentucky really led the
[SPEAKER_01]: charge in the early years.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that most states are
missing is support from their extension
[SPEAKER_01]: services, which all farmers utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what you're up to these
days, Tom, but Tom was the Kentucky hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist for the extension services.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, to answer your question,
we're trying to find markets for the dust,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some things out there today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically just turn it back into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to provide some nutritional value
to our farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take it out on a dump truck and
spread it on a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We applied a few value added opportunities
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composite space, lawn and garden space,
erosion control haven't quite hit yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size field do we have to grow to make
it worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is dependent on your farm operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the old days, it's something like CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking much smaller acres,
more of a tobacco type of model.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, with grain and fiber,
we typically don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our farmers don't do anything less than 40
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it probably makes the most sense in
the 100 to 200 acre range.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow thousands of acres, though,
which maybe is different than other parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the country where a farmer might grow
average like 500 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our farm's going to be as much as 40,000
acres out here in Montana, more typically
[SPEAKER_01]: in the 10,000 acre range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Vanessa, for your compliment.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so this might be a question beyond
your presentation agronomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know whether there's any sort
of audio lepithothi with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if I said that word
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we grow hemp in a farm continuously or
should we rotate it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are definitely not advocates of
monocropping with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that there's any good studies
out there other than sort of generic
[SPEAKER_01]: disease cycle breaking types of
components.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the expert on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely encourage rotational
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that's better for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can diversify their portfolio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, hemp has a long tap root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in our neck of the woods,
sometimes it can be useful to break up
[SPEAKER_01]: some of that hard packed soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's useful to rotate it around for
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not the expert on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely recommend rotating.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you believe is the biggest barrier
to entry and how to overcome that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to depend a little bit on
what vertical we might be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's been happening in your
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got, it can start with just
getting seed can be a barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've sort of gotten beyond that
and you're starting to look at how do I
[SPEAKER_01]: make a successful business.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges that we see right
now is hemp foods are not growing very
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we kind of did peak hemp heart in
a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most consumers that know about hemp
foods are eating hemp foods in the current
[SPEAKER_01]: format.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a challenge on the food
side of the business is finding markets
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The export opportunity is growing,
I would say, in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think on the oil seed side,
it starts with what are those markets and
[SPEAKER_01]: how do I address them.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the fiber side, there's a lot of market
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are growing pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've seen in the industry is capital
being one of the biggest challenges to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to kind of get up and running to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you sort of need a walk,
crawl, run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to invest in large scale
infrastructure if you don't have some
[SPEAKER_01]: successful operating supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easier to get a supply chain
going at a smaller scale, but you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: provide goods at a competitive price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some challenges there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of depends on where you're at
in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at the farm level, harvesting
equipment might be a big challenge for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to supply fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be a processor,
then getting the capital to scale may be
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in almost all cases, at this point,
hemp is replacing something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: New opportunities for hemp, wholly new,
are a little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding those easy wins is critical,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please talk about the unique aspects of
hemp supply chain branches as they relate
[SPEAKER_01]: to seed, fiber building materials,
and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dave, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really big advocates for dual
cropping, dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you grow for grain, you still
have a stalk out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some genetics that are more
optimized to have more stalk or more grain
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can harvest the grain,
and then you can harvest the straw as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a plant, that sort of whole plant
utilization is really powerful,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly at the farm level,
because the farmer has sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to make two revenue streams,
the grain and the straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just more compelling to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The infrastructure to process,
on the other hand, is pretty different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the equipment you're going to
process the grain with is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: different than the straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does require two sets of
infrastructure there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nevertheless, at the farm level,
they can be combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's not to say that you aren't
giving something up, like your yield may
[SPEAKER_01]: go down on the grain for both the straw or
the grain, and your quality of the fiber
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be as good if it's coming from a
grain crop, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still opportunities to address
a lot of the market share because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that is, in some cases,
there are overlaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we do a lot in the animal
sector, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we process the straw, we sell
bedding into equestrian and small pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some non-wovens for laying
hen mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then on the oilseed side, we have
Omega-369 supplements of the oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: protein and dietary fiber that all come
from the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bit of a Venn diagram in some
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, you're addressing different
markets where the straw is going to more
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial materials, which have a crazy
amount of opportunities from building
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, insulation, hempcrete,
even potentially to structural components
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to pulp and paper and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of diversity in the opportunity
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's done to eliminate pesticides or
heavy metals that might be present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't really do anything if it
is in the crop, to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to remediate it after
you've harvested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a problem with this in Canada a
little while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a large market in Croats Korea
for, I believe, hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may butcher this a little bit,
but I wasn't intimately involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they changed the regulations on some
of the assay data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think cobalt might have been
the issue is they lowered the allowable
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of cobalt and made a big scare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Large markets were lost there for hemp
grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once it's in there, it's hard to
get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really better off on the front end,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing your soil selection and
picking soils that don't have those
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because hemp is a phytoremediator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will collect those heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most pesticides you can't use on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very few are certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, there shouldn't be too much
pesticide usage on the hemp itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some residual in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do test for that for time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there again, once it's in there,
you can't really get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more about crop production
practices and soil selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which verticals do you expect to grow in
the next three to five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, we see the most growth on the
fiber side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Building materials and automotive.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a guy that's been in the industry for a
while, I can tell you that one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting things happened recently for our
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my knowledge, it's probably the
first time in the US that an automotive
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier formally asked a hemp fiber
supplier to bid on a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of talk, lots of trialing,
lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we finally got the opportunity to
actually bid on a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think automotive has got some
potential in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know that we'll get that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying we're gonna get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pretty big milestone that we at least
got a for real opportunity to bid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the fiber side, we're seeing lots
of growth for the bass fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't come without challenges on
the herd side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while the herd opportunities are
growing, the key is balancing the herd
[SPEAKER_01]: demand with the fiber production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say there are needs on the herd
side to grow markets to complement the
[SPEAKER_01]: fiber side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't get too overly optimistic
about bass fiber because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all about that co-product usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about utilization to make a
successful business model in finding paths
[SPEAKER_01]: for off takes for those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your growers all grow according to the
same specs, seeding rate, variety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we do a few different varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a few different models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we do X59 for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do some Asian varieties for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those changes, seeding rates are much
lower for grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the 20, 25 pounds the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: For fiber, you're in the 50 plus pounds of
the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fibralization changes based on those
applications and of course, whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil has in it to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some general guardrails,
but it is on a farm by farm basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have your farmers red the fiber
crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we want them to,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay more even some cases if it is
redded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty important for the fiber
quality to red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there some hemp specific
bioremediation efforts, impacts,
[SPEAKER_01]: and outcomes in your community or range of
farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of going back to that question about
the heavy metals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an opportunity for bio or fiber
remediation, but then what do you do with
[SPEAKER_01]: that material?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are places that don't care
where you might be able to use that and
[SPEAKER_01]: where that product can make sense maybe in
a plastic or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not seeing a lot of that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our founder Ken is working with a large
oil company to do a demonstration project.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the end games is, well,
at first, let's say you plant the crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: it remediates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a few stages of what we
can do from there, whether it's composted,
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it into an industrial product where
they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then biochar is another opportunity as
well that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good way to sequestion the
carbon and sort of triage some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pretty much out of time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one last question of the acreage your
farmers grow, how much is irrigated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost 100% of our fiber acres are
irrigated and almost 100% of our grain
[SPEAKER_01]: acres are not irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that varies by year to year,
how many acres we're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this year, we'll have 2000 acres
or we're targeting about 2000 acres on
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation for fiber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turn it back over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everybody for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Trey.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great talk and answered so many
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really useful and
enlightening about your work and IND hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and their role in the hemp space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next session will be in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have Dr. David Gang from
Washington State University who's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about expanding the national hemp
germplasm collection and supporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this recording will be uploaded to our
YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_00]: The link for that is in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's more resources on our
Cornell hemp website for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for joining and I'm going to
sign off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Trey, again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
