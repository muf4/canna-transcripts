[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I work with Jean-Luc Yannick and
Virginia Moore on two different
[SPEAKER_07]: intercropping projects.
[SPEAKER_07]: And intercropping is just when you grow
two species together in the same time or
[SPEAKER_07]: space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some cool benefits of
intercropping that have been described in
[SPEAKER_07]: literature, including increased
biodiversity and environmental service
[SPEAKER_07]: capacity of a system, reduced pest and
disease, you spread the risk, of like
[SPEAKER_07]: natural disasters and still getting some
kind of yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the potential for niche
differentiation and the compatibility
[SPEAKER_07]: facilitation effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for these to work, there's a need for
a lot of agronomic innovations,
[SPEAKER_07]: including planting and harvesting,
processing, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it also presents a novel environment
to breed for since the species must
[SPEAKER_07]: perform well with another species in the
system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And not just by itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may need to look at both genotypes
when we're breeding for these systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So intercropping two species together,
that can be a cover crop with cash crop,
[SPEAKER_07]: or it can be like what I'm working on with
two different cash crops together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they can be configured in different
ways, like in fixtures, think about like
[SPEAKER_07]: broadcasting just different species of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can be in alleys with one crop
between rows of trees, in rows or in
[SPEAKER_07]: strips.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way I'm doing it with the
intermediate wheatgrass alfalfa is
[SPEAKER_07]: alternating rows.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the oats and peas with John
Luke's lab, it's mixed within rows.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the oats and peas are together in the
rows, as you can see in the picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of the preliminary results I'm
going to show today are for the oats and
[SPEAKER_07]: pea project.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did want to bring up the
intermediate wheatgrass alfalfa
[SPEAKER_07]: intercropping because it's pretty cool as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also a dual use system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can, the farmer has the option,
at least a little more option on the
[SPEAKER_07]: markets that they go to where you can
harvest for grain and forage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so this oats and pea project
included 48 different oats accessions and
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 different pea accessions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's over 500 different combinations
if we're evaluating them in intercrop.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're spread across six different
locations where each possible combination
[SPEAKER_07]: is represented at least in one of these
locations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had two different types of peas,
the forage, which, is this coming up on
[SPEAKER_07]: the screen?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, okay, so the forage is on the far,
an example of the forage is on the far
[SPEAKER_07]: side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a field or grain type pea is the
one in the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did this, there's like a difference in
morphology where the field type has a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: more leaf area.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tends to be taller and the grain type
is more compact.
[SPEAKER_07]: And has more of this tendrils.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, the idea is that these difference
in morphology could maybe have an
[SPEAKER_07]: influence in the competitive interactions
in an intercrop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, so this year from New York,
here's kind of some box plots of what the
[SPEAKER_07]: biomass looked like when we sampled at
four different time points throughout the
[SPEAKER_07]: season.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we found that the oats biomass in a
plot was a lot higher than what we got for
[SPEAKER_07]: the biomass of the peas, but that there's
no difference between the oat biomass on
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's with a field pea or forage
pea, or even in the monoculture plots that
[SPEAKER_07]: we did, where I guess I should explain
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, there's this intercrop with a
specific oat accession and a specific pea
[SPEAKER_07]: accession.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then right next to it, we had that
same oats planted in a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we found is no preliminary,
at least, that interaction for biomass was
[SPEAKER_07]: not significant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then for grain yields, I used mixed
linear models and did find that certain
[SPEAKER_07]: genotypes were significant covariance for
both the oat, the pea, and the total yield
[SPEAKER_07]: of the plot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do need to do more analysis on this,
but it indicates that there are
[SPEAKER_07]: differences in intercrop compatibility.
[SPEAKER_07]: To evaluate how genotypes perform with any
genotype of the other species,
[SPEAKER_07]: we look at the general mixing ability.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for this, I used Bayesian generalized
linear regression with a multivariate
[SPEAKER_07]: model.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can look at both the outcome of the
oat yield and the pea yield with multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: sources of variation from location,
block within year and location,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the oat accession, the pea accession,
and the year by itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're seeing here is in the top
one, it's the oat genotype on the x-axis,
[SPEAKER_07]: that genotype effect on that oats yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the pea that is with any of the
pea that it's with is on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in orange, we see that there are some
oat genotypes that have a positive effect
[SPEAKER_07]: on both the oat and the pea yield in that
plot.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the same, we see that there are some
that for pea genotypes doing the same
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also curious on the competitive
interaction between the specific oat
[SPEAKER_07]: accession and pea accession.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here what I did was looked at that oat
intercrop and the monoculture right beside
[SPEAKER_07]: it for oat yield and found that some
combinations, the oat yield was higher in
[SPEAKER_07]: intercrop than it was in the monoculture
beside it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some combinations that oats had a
lower yield than it was in the intercrop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, showing that there are differences
in these compatibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these plots are the specific
combinations from Illinois and New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why not every combination is
shown as a color here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not every location had these monocultures
to compare.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the reds are like, the more red
it is, the lower the oat yield and
[SPEAKER_07]: intercrop was in compared to its
monoculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then grains are where the intercrop
oat yield was higher than its monoculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comparing this to these general mixing
ability idea, I saw that there are peas
[SPEAKER_07]: like Maxim where no matter what it's with,
it has a negative effect on that oat
[SPEAKER_07]: yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's some also that are at least
more positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So excited to work more on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my acknowledgments, I am very thankful
to be in two great labs with John Luke and
[SPEAKER_07]: Jenny.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our field crew for this Oat and Pea
project is Peter Hyde.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neerja is doing very similar work with
winter oats and peas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a great undergrad,
Adrian, who's been with us for a couple
[SPEAKER_07]: summers now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also got great feedback on this from
joint lab meetings with the Soros lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And get a lot of field help from their
field crew of David and Jason.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Oat and Pea project has a lot of
collaborators with Patrick Ewing at the
[SPEAKER_07]: USDA, Vermont, Martin and Wolf at LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: University of Alabama, Juan David Alvarez
at Illinois, Sia Gutierrez with Chacon at
[SPEAKER_07]: University of Wisconsin, Stephen Wilkie in
Minnesota, and Melanie Kafe at South
[SPEAKER_07]: Dakota.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Moore lab, our field crew is
Julie Hanson, Jamie, and Ryan Crawford,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Jesse Chavez.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that Alpha Alpha Intermediate project
is funded by the Alpha Alpha Enforged
[SPEAKER_07]: Research Program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of that project was done
previously by someone who graduated with
[SPEAKER_07]: their master's in 2024, Megan Williams.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have collaborators listed for there
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any environmental predictors of
these compatibilities?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any environmental factors for
the compatibility?
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't looked into that yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do need to calculate genotype
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can get climate data, but we
haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are future things.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering, for the one variety where
you saw it just kind of decrease the
[SPEAKER_05]: oatmeal across the board, are you
interested in looking further to try and
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out why that variety is decreasing
you, or just kind of outside the scope of
[SPEAKER_05]: your research?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I showed that the one pea, maximum pea,
had an overall negative effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: on whatever oats it was with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so am I interested in why that might
be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still figuring out where I'm going
with my thesis work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, more interested in more general
interactions.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a forage type, but I didn't
see any difference between forage and
[SPEAKER_07]: fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: So not quite sure what that morphology or
what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What other phenotypes are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_07]: We took height measurements and emergence
counts and maturity notes as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Peter Hyde also flies a drone
quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have multispectral data that I'm not
working with, but we'll have that to
[SPEAKER_07]: compare as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Beatriz Conedrio, and I'm with
the Bakla Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: This afternoon, I'll be talking about
exploring trade-offs between cold and
[SPEAKER_02]: drought tolerance and tryptoclonal
lactulitis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we picked these two stresses
because drought has been known to be one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the single most limiting factor
affecting maize production in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also by building frost resilient
crops, we'll be able to improve yields by
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 percent and also reduce our reliance on
nitrogen by 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then based on research, there are some
similar shared pathways between these two
[SPEAKER_02]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's still a knowledge gap
between the trade-offs and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: synergies that exist between these two
stresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is where this research comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you got me thinking about how
certain maize relatives are able to adapt
[SPEAKER_02]: to these two stresses, whilst maize
doesn't have that flexibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was thinking, could it be that
they possess certain specific genetic and
[SPEAKER_02]: physiological adaptations, or it could be
due to modifications that helps them to
[SPEAKER_02]: better express their genes or their
metabolic pathways or their genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I settled on trypsicum because
it's been known to be the closest
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial relative of maize with frost
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then evolutionists believe that about
500,000 years ago, maize and trypsicum
[SPEAKER_02]: diverged from each other, leading to some
loss of functions in maize that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: present in trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so trypsicum tends to serve as like a
reservoir for some good traits that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be used to transform maize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the data sets that I intend to use
to capture, to test my hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_02]: include some samples of trypsicum that
were sampled by Denise Costige and Nicola
[SPEAKER_02]: Park in our lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sampled across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and then crossed with each other to
generate F1s and then left to open
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinates to generate F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by observation, we realized that there
are some of them that have, that are frost
[SPEAKER_02]: tolerance and others that are drought
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have the right population to do
this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, another data set that will
be involved in this study is a trypsicum
[SPEAKER_02]: population panel from a PANAN project that
was conducted in collaboration with our
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to test my first hypothesis,
I have eight HIFI long-read assemblies
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'll be assembling to create a PhD,
after which I would use that PhD to impute
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of trypsicum samples from the
PANAN project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, I intend to perform an
environmental GWAS study to identify some
[SPEAKER_02]: drought and cold plus I, and then also use
the DNA language model to identify some
[SPEAKER_02]: causal variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my eight genotypes that I selected,
I tried as much as possible to capture
[SPEAKER_02]: enough diversity within the population
that we, the F1 populations that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used this MDS plot and then
selected my eight genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have my HIFI long-reads now that
I am currently assembling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for my next hypothesis test on the
comparative expression analysis of cold
[SPEAKER_02]: and drought, myself together with Lara
Brindisi, who is a postdoc in our lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: have been screening trypsicum and the
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we've been doing is to have
some batches that are cold acclimated
[SPEAKER_02]: first, that is we move them, after
planting them, we move them to the cold
[SPEAKER_02]: chamber at 10 degrees Celsius during the
day and then six degrees Celsius during
[SPEAKER_02]: the night, after which they are moved to
the freezer at a minus six degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during this time points, we sample
tissue for RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the non-cold acclimation batch,
we just move, planted them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse and then move them straight to
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also do tissue collection at these
time points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another cool thing that I also did
together with my PI this summer was to
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest the trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've ever worked with
trypsicum, you would know that it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: tedious to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to shatter and lose their seeds
on the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to get enough harvest from
your seed, you would have to try certain
[SPEAKER_02]: means that end up being extremely
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely tedious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried out this protocol whereby we
cut the head, some trypsicum seed heads
[SPEAKER_02]: together with the corns and then replace
them in mason jars filled with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so initially we were very skeptical
about this because we didn't know if it
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to affect the viability of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far so good, we realized that after
performing our germination test,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you de-haul the seeds, you have about
54% seeds germinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the whole seeds tend to have like
lower germination rates, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: cool, especially for trypsicum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for my next step, the seeds that
we'll obtain from this summer seed harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: will be used to set up my drought tolerant
experiments, which will be conducted in
[SPEAKER_02]: the BTI phenotyping facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that brings me to the end of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would however like to thank the Bakla
Lab for assisting me during this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have bagged a whole lot of people and I
would like to thank them specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: that because I'm not even done with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, I would also like to thank
my committee members for providing
[SPEAKER_02]: insights into this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also my funding sources,
the Sloan-Baget Foundation for supporting
[SPEAKER_02]: my doctoral journey, and then the USDA ARS
for supporting this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with crossing, I said that there were
some that were drought tolerant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there are some that were fees
intolerant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by crossing, you end up crossing
some of these traits together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so moving on to the F2 generation,
you would have these traits segregating
[SPEAKER_02]: within the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, that is why we have the F2
and then the F1 population.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all you collected, a lot of your
samples from like lower latitudes in the
[SPEAKER_05]: US.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you find that they grow a bit
differently or a bit less when they're put
[SPEAKER_05]: up here in New York State?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say they grow up differently,
but then they have... So I know that the
[SPEAKER_02]: lower parts are like much more warmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are some that's, collections
from that side have proved that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: drought tolerant, being under controlled
environments.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm a third year in Wojtek Flowski's
lab, but I did a rotation project.
[SPEAKER_03]: With Holly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how it started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually going to be speaking about
my work with Holly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end, I will just warn you,
there's going to be an abrupt change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a couple of slides about
Wojtek's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how this study arose, I feel like it
really started in my undergrad,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we knew we would be in the field for
long days and we were to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times we'd talk about career
versus family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the challenges with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just observing a more
diverse graduate student population and
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty population.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really made me wonder like where all of
the women go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then since I don't have any experience
with social science work or just
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding parenthood, I decided to
read literature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the topics in bold are what really
kept parenthood standing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also in literature, they said
that the solution was policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's missing from the literature is
that there's nothing on this topic,
[SPEAKER_03]: even in plant science in general,
but for sure not plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the studies either have women or
men.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also most of these studies only
have like five or eight respondents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to get 31 respondents,
way more than I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, so I originally actually
wanted to interview the people that had
[SPEAKER_03]: left the field, but that data is either
not there or it's confidential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it made me realize that I have to
collect my own data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this kind of turned into a qualitative
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I landed on the question of
understanding how care responsibilities
[SPEAKER_03]: and gender have shaped a tenure track
faculty's academic career in plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to go over a few definitions,
I wanted to broaden only talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: parenthood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked the respondents also about
like elder care, caring for another person
[SPEAKER_03]: in their family and also themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another definition I want to go over is
gender.
[SPEAKER_03]: So gender norms are the social expectation
and rules that dictate how people should
[SPEAKER_03]: behave and express themselves based on
their gender.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is usually developed during
adolescence and can be influenced over
[SPEAKER_03]: time and also by culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to go over the process a little bit,
because I'm going to assume that most
[SPEAKER_03]: people have not done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first step is to develop the project
and kind of figure out what I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: interview, what questions I want to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I write up forms, like an interview
guide, an email that I would send out to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I submit all these forms to the IRB
for approval.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is also a tedious process,
but once it's approved, then I can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually reach out to the participants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I conduct a one hour
semi-structured interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means that I can start out with
one question and then I can ask follow-up
[SPEAKER_03]: questions that the IRB is not aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the questions or the big topics that I
asked about were like, what are your care
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how do they affect your work
environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: And were there any policies involved?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after I have the interviews,
I verify that the recordings match the
[SPEAKER_03]: transcripts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after that, I code the
transcripts with MaxQDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a software to systematically
analyze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably the most similar to
someone like phenotyping for disease
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come up with a standard first and
then kind of go based off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's kind of what this is doing
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually after a few hours of
coding, I develop a code book and that is
[SPEAKER_03]: used for analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the criteria to participate in
the study was that you had to be a tenure
[SPEAKER_03]: track faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to be at an R1 university that I
selected, but I'm keeping that
[SPEAKER_03]: confidential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to be defined as a prep
reader by your institution to reduce my
[SPEAKER_03]: bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just some facts about the
participants in the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 31 participants, 11 women,
20 men.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found that to be representative of
the actual type reading population out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I interviewed assistant,
associate, and full professors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will say that there were eight
participants that did not have any care
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to cut the slide even though it was
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, this is a huge part of the
study, is that people who were
[SPEAKER_03]: international or foreign born,
they said that it was much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: But due to time, I had to cut the slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And childcare and elder care were the most
common care responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to dive into some of the examples from
the interview, my first point is that
[SPEAKER_03]: upbringing kind of shapes cultural norms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one example is this professor who is in
Asian culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very common to expect that the
mother-in-law will come for a few months
[SPEAKER_03]: after birth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he didn't even think to take any time
off to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he expected his mother-in-law and wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this other professor,
both of his parents worked when he grew
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he expected that his wife would
never stay home and him and her would also
[SPEAKER_03]: share the care responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to talk about a few
difficulties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to talk about how they
coped with those difficulties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were the main difficulties that I
saw within the interviews.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will only talk about fieldwork and
dual-career couples today and give
[SPEAKER_03]: examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fieldwork, I think, is very specific to
plant breeding because you just are so
[SPEAKER_03]: dependent on so many other factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many collaborators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, weather is another big one that
makes it kind of difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to give some examples on how plant
breeding fieldwork and balance and care
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities is challenging,
when I brought this up in the interviews,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got lots of comments like, this is a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the busiest time of year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just doing my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this example, she said that it was
very intense and her and her husband were
[SPEAKER_03]: both plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had to be out in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said that she didn't really start
actual field breeding until her kids were
[SPEAKER_03]: like three or six because it was just so
challenging.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as they grew up, she was able to spend
more time in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then moving on to discuss a little bit
about dual-career couples.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one guy says that when he says,
oh, I need to take care of the kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: his response is very positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But her response, I mean, yeah,
she can get criticized sometimes,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though they both actually tried to
share their responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also just want to note that I
had a wide range of participants that had
[SPEAKER_03]: a partner as a stay-at-home mom all the
way to like, they were also a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the relationships where they
really did strive to be people,
[SPEAKER_03]: I still noticed that the mothers were
still handling more of the logistics and
[SPEAKER_03]: management of the children, like making
sure that they are going to the dentist
[SPEAKER_03]: every year or like knowing the names of
their doctors or things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then moving into how these guys coped.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest one was mainly family that
lived close by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, for example, this PI, she really
relied heavily on her parents to take care
[SPEAKER_03]: of her child for the first three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she is an assistant professor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she said, I really could not have
started without my parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: They helped so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that was the main
form of support was just money,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to hire a nanny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess as a grad student,
I was surprised at how many people had
[SPEAKER_03]: nannies, especially for like three to six
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these nannies really became like a
second mom to the children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then daycare was another huge topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this example, she said that there's
zero flexibility with drop-off and pick-up
[SPEAKER_03]: times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she would have to leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if she wasn't done with work,
she would have to work in the evening,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be pretty exhausting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then so to finish up with this,
the main points were that care
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities are shaped by upbringing
and cultural and gender norms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then field work and traveling were the
biggest challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I kind of forgot to mention
traveling a bit, but traveling,
[SPEAKER_03]: both men and women, I noticed that they
had to reduce their amount of travel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was even worse in dual-career
couples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then community and financial resources
were the main things that helped faculty
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of overcome these difficulties and
manage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of literature, I did ask about
policy and I had that in the interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not one faculty had anything good to
say about policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really don't think that this is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think reasonably, it would help if more
so if we adjusted our attitude about care
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities in academia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think another thing that would be big is
changing our attitude, especially towards
[SPEAKER_03]: using the policies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of negative attitude towards
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one thing that I wish I would
have asked more so in the interviews is
[SPEAKER_03]: more so about your work environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that plays a bigger role than if
there's policies or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just building community and
having a support network seems to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: most helpful for these faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're going to make the abrupt
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so I am again in Wojtek Blauski's
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I work on double-stranded breaks in
recombination with Mays.
[SPEAKER_03]: So recombination is obviously very helpful
for plant breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will allow us like breeders to stack
traits or kind of break traits apart to
[SPEAKER_03]: create new combinations of alleles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so recombination starts with
double-stranded breaks and it ends in
[SPEAKER_03]: crossovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we can see, the double-stranded
break distribution is quite uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then crossovers mainly happen at
chromosome ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guess you can't see it, but there's
roughly 200 to 500 double-stranded breaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many, but then only 10 to 20
crossovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it made me wonder if we could
predict these double-stranded breaks
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to these double-stranded breaks
in the middle of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of my questions is,
can crossover-competent DSPs be
[SPEAKER_03]: distinguished from crossover-incompetent
DSPs?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I am looking at genomic location,
CG and CHG, DNA methylation, and DNA
[SPEAKER_03]: replication origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hypothesis is that double-stranded
breaks that do result in crossovers have
[SPEAKER_03]: very similar environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that DSPs in genomic
regions and low-methylated areas and in
[SPEAKER_03]: early replication regions in S phase are
more likely to result in crossovers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to say a little bit about
this, but I won't go into any results or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to say thank you to Holly
for letting me do this project and also
[SPEAKER_03]: for the participants for giving me their
time to be interviewed, and for them to
[SPEAKER_03]: trust me with their stories and
experiences, because I think that is
[SPEAKER_03]: really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for Voightek for my
double-stranded break project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just wondering how do you feel about
your life, two different types of research
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess there's something that you liked
more or less about the kind of more social
[SPEAKER_05]: research versus what you're doing now,
and what motivated that switch?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, so what motivated the switch is I
worked in industry for a little bit in
[SPEAKER_03]: between my undergrad and grad school,
and I just felt like I had such a horrible
[SPEAKER_03]: experience that it kind of pissed me off
when I said I'm going to do this project
[SPEAKER_03]: with Holly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess, I forget what the first
part was, but just the differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say with the DSB project,
it is really hard to analyze ChIP-seq
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not with transcription factors,
but something that occurs all across the
[SPEAKER_03]: genome that is difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also something difficult with the
qualitative data is that each story is so
[SPEAKER_03]: unique, that it's just so hard to kind of
make sense of it, which is why I find
[SPEAKER_03]: MaxQDA really helpful, so that I can kind
of mark up the transcripts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to comment on how poetic the
switch was, about going from your work to
[SPEAKER_05]: your life, and how that balance sometimes
isn't balanced, as it kind of was in the
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really enjoyed the fact that you
included them, because they were very
[SPEAKER_05]: important to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the CARE project, is there any sort
of continuing thought that you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation that we can start having here
at Cornell to be able to open the dialogue
[SPEAKER_05]: out for women who want to go back to
positions, and worry about having
[SPEAKER_05]: children, and having me, and if you have
any thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have thought about potentially
having a discussion here, or at a
[SPEAKER_03]: conference, especially with the generation
now, and the older generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear some of the challenges that
they've gone through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that is actually something
that kind of prompted this, having
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations with older women,
and just kind of seeing how sad they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also just having conversations
with my peers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a lot of people kind of worry
about being able to do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they were similar, as in that they
had print to leave, but the amount of time
[SPEAKER_03]: was very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some were like two weeks, some were 10
weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think at one point, at one university,
it was like two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I just want to point out that after
music graduate, science are having a
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion about topics within the Big Red
Barn, from, I think it's probably from 4-3
[SPEAKER_05]: to 6.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are these final discussions going
on on campus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for doing this, considering your
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned that when we're explaining
what sexism is, how do you define that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that they didn't have family,
or they have all the people to care for,
[SPEAKER_05]: or they do not have children.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And my second question is, you mentioned
that for dual couples, there is more
[SPEAKER_05]: control on the woman than the man.
[SPEAKER_05]: What exact impact does this have on music?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are good questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'll answer the first question
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did I define someone with no care
responsibilities?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was someone that either didn't have any
children, didn't have any sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: dependents, and then also people that had
not yet had to take care of their parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know eventually they might have to,
but they didn't really have any sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: care need.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also said that it wasn't really a
burden, like they didn't have any health
[SPEAKER_03]: issues, anything self-related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, can you remind me what your
second question was?
[SPEAKER_05]: You were talking about the dual couples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dual work and the traveling took more
control on the women than the men.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what exact impact does this have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one example that I had to cut out
was that she, this female faculty,
[SPEAKER_03]: she said that her husband also was a
faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he also was a career, but in
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he had to drive, I think he worked
like 20 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she said since she was closer,
she still had to, like if there was any
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of emergency, she'd have to go pick
up her children, or she would have to take
[SPEAKER_03]: the day off.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was always kind of the one sacrificing
if there was any sort of need that the
[SPEAKER_03]: kids had, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a comment, this is a question,
but one of the side effects of COVID is
[SPEAKER_06]: that they're breaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people talk about medical often,
people who can't go, so if they're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: it, you can't leave.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't look at all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can actually still type in,
like it's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get this on my own.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's something that I don't think,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, that did come up in the interviews
where some people were like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I am on Zoom, but I still have to take
care of my child.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
