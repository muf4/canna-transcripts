[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, good morning again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a beautiful day,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember yesterday when we were out in
front of the building, Bradfield Hall,
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about some of the landscaping
and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually this area right outside Mann
Library here was part of a project that
[SPEAKER_00]: was led by Nina Bassack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned her earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: She directs the Urban Horticulture
Initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she has a class, and in her class they
take on a little project, like right in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of the library or in front of
another building, and they amend the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, they bring in the compost and
the mulch and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she's been doing that for,
I don't know, 12, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in time she had a grad
student who made that a project and then
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at the long-term impact of the soil
remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can just do an anecdotal
assessment, maybe when you have a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes on the break and just walk out
here and see how nice the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I'm going to talk about some
of the research results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've seen our soil health testing or
analysis infrastructure, and over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years we've done some research with that
and I wanted to show you the results of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and give you some insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one set of experiments involved
different tillage treatments, and Bob and
[SPEAKER_00]: I started an experiment over 25 years ago,
and we kept it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically when you go to a no-till
or strip-till type system where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: disturb the soil, you tend to see kind of
an improvement of soil health,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean just generic speaking soil health
as measured by different indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do cover cropping, you tend to see
a quicker response because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do no-till you just, you don't,
you slowly improve the soil by not
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use a cover crop or you apply
manure or compost, you more quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're getting an injection
basically of biological organic material,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you typically have a faster response,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what we hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to include cover crops
about five years ago after we hired a new
[SPEAKER_00]: colleague, Matt Ryan, who is an expert on
that, and he has an interceder where he
[SPEAKER_00]: used that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the hypotheses was, if you
combine practices, do you get more impact,
[SPEAKER_00]: more positive impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they really additive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a whole bunch of analysis
using our soil health test, and I won't go
[SPEAKER_00]: into too much detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's first see what is the effect of
no-tilling versus plowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more or less in continuous
corn, which is really not an ideal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see that, for example,
agri-stability, active carbon and protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a fairly significant increase,
especially with agri-stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a 92% increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't disturb the soil,
then especially you have a benefit with
[SPEAKER_00]: agri-stability, but also with these more
labile organic matter indicators,
[SPEAKER_00]: active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which type of soil does this not work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that works on just about every
type of soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we will always see the benefits of
no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying that no-till is
applicable to all soils?
[SPEAKER_02]: With respect to increases in improving
soil health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right now, you may have some
real challenges with no-till on,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, more high clay content soil and,
say, sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see, in terms of soil health,
you'll see consistent benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we had some other experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a loamy soil, silt loam,
and we also had experiments on clay loam
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and sandy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically saw the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, Joseph, we should maybe put
some of those papers on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you do see those benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, if you go into a no-till
system, you typically see it's typically a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot easier to do that on a more sandy,
coarse textured soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, that's on the Delmarva
Peninsula.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see very high adoption of no-till
because the soils are really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: amenable to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at the effect of tillage,
and now we have tillage plus cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is plow-till, no cover crop,
plow-till with cover crop, and no-till,
[SPEAKER_00]: no cover crop, and plow-till with cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that, even after three years,
we see that there's an additive effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits of the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing tillage gives you a good
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you stability organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: But by adding a cover crop, you're seeing
this additional benefit, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice because when we think about my first
presentation yesterday where we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about some of these cropping systems
exporting a lot of the carbon and the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and so how do you make up for
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep that system sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, reducing tillage, bringing in cover
crop seems to be helping you maintain some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are not always significant,
but the trend is definitely there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was only after a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's kind of good news,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is working with Diana Osment at North
Carolina State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a number of long-term tillage
trials, like 26 years, and did some
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling, sent the samples to our lab,
and things got analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a very interesting study in
terms of the conclusions because one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the real challenges with soil health is
can you demonstrate that it increases
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately a farmer might say,
yeah, soil health, that's great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how does it help me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there may be some input costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover cropping costs you money,
maybe costs you $30 an acre, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or going to no-till requires investment in
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it increase the bottom line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here this graph shows you the three
different tillage systems that were being
[SPEAKER_00]: used, so conventional plowing,
a no-till, or it's actually a minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: till, you might say, and then chisel,
which is kind of an in-between practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this graph show you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you the relationship between
protein, so one of the indicators,
[SPEAKER_00]: and tillage, and you can see that as you
reduce tillage, you increase the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: content of the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So ignore this for now, so you get more
protein if you reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tillage seems to be unfavorable in
terms of the protein content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that you see here is as
tillage increases protein, it also is
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with higher yields,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are quite significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the yields are 50, 70% higher in
the minimum till system, and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with higher protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that if you throw a lot of
protein on the soil, like whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: some waste material or so, that you
necessarily get higher yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in this experiment, there's an
association between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is just a tillage experiment,
so there's no compost applied or manure or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, just tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're starting to learn that there are
these associations, so it apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the next slide will show many of these
same graphs for different soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same graph, it's a relationship,
so this one is the same as the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bars here are the variation in yields,
and so it was a huge variation from year
[SPEAKER_00]: to year, whether it was a dry year or a
wet year in North Carolina, they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these are the other indicators,
active carbon, manganese, respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: added stability, phosphorus, magnesium,
and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I ranked them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one with the best correlation was
protein, the one that I showed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second best was active carbon,
R squared of 0.85, then manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: then respiration, added stability,
and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and these were the indicators that
were significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of them were not significant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a couple of points here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, organic matter actually had a fairly
weak relationship with yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with mean yield, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: While protein and active carbon,
so these kind of new indicators,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a much better correlation with yield,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're learning that it's these labile
organic matter compounds in the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be more associated with increases
in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see those changes because we have
different choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so aggregates, so these three are
these biological, new biological
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators, and they are the strongest
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manganese, you might ask, well,
why manganese, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, manganese is involved in the
decomposition of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an electron exchange, manganese two
plus, three plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a biochemical process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, manganese, although it's a
chemical indicator, actually is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: biological indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggregate stability is the first
physical indicator with still a good
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, we know that aggregate
stability is very much related to these
[SPEAKER_00]: other labile organic matter compounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have these other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very interesting experiment,
and we learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we've been able to establish a
relationship between soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to establish that
these labile indicators, the indicators of
[SPEAKER_00]: labile organic matter, seem to be more
important than the total organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's actually these other R-squared
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here, because it was a corn
and soybean experiment, here are the
[SPEAKER_00]: R-squared values for the corn yields,
right?
And you see the protein was good,
respiration, active carbon, and manganese,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: For soybean yield, well, the protein is
actually quite weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily the respiration and the
active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is soybean yield not as strongly
related to protein, while corn yield is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the whole, because it's a
legume and a nitrogen and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and protein contains a lot of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you some confidence that,
yeah, that actually makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, you see, active carbon,
the mean yield has a correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficient of 0.93, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually was really quite high with
the corn as well, which is the second
[SPEAKER_00]: highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So active carbon appears to be a really
good indicator that correlates with yield
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein seems to be a very good correlator
with yields of probably grasses or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-legumes, all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that because of nitrogen fixation
versus nitrogen that may be operating in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's what we think, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it makes sense, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here's another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Joseph alluded to it yesterday
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it Bob?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had quite a few samples analyzed a
few years ago, over 3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a lot more, and we'll show
some more data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a grad student, Aubrey Fine,
and I said, well, let's make a comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: between these three regions, the
Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the portion of Midwest, we have a
lot of these grassland soils and best
[SPEAKER_00]: soils in the world, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were thinking, oh, we will just
have great soils there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's make these measurements of
these soil health indicators and then see
[SPEAKER_00]: how the numbers come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you see the gray box,
that means that for that region,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the highest value, or the most
favorable value, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see, let's take organic
matter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that the Northeast, it's about 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid-Atlantic, it's a little over 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwest was only 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Midwestern soil on the average had 1% less
organic matter than the soils in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast or the Mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you are from the
Mid-Atlantic?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Active carbon, lowest in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein, less than half, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration resistance is a higher number,
so it's less favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really very surprising to us
that the soils that we regard or the
[SPEAKER_00]: region that we regard as having the best
soils turn out not to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, well, why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the samples that we got into
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab, so we didn't really have a lot of
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like on the average,
because in this region, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: export of carbon and nutrients,
like what I talked about yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our region, we have a lot more
dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot more organic farms,
a lot more application of manure and
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the average, we see that our soils
actually for the top six inches are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with the Mid-Atlantic,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how some of our thinking came
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have to think about where the
carbon and the nutrients go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a corn-soybean rotation,
it's row crops, and you export most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon and nutrients, and it goes to China
or Mexico or Europe or a place like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be having a long-term
impact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that got our thinking going on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, Dave and I have been talking
about what that means for New York with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health and maybe getting some of this
carbon and nutrients from the excess
[SPEAKER_00]: farms, like the dairy farms, to some of
the other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gene is going to talk about how we can
do some of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, Joseph has been, and I'm
presenting the data here, but really,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's done all the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He deserves a lot of the credit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now had, and this is actually now
already a year ago, we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples from different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see some of the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, of course, we have a lot of
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also, from the Midwest,
Iowa, Indiana, we have lots of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we don't necessarily have
all the details around the farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have such large numbers of samples that
you can start doing some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: analyses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, especially for New York,
we have many, many samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can start doing some work on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got some funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the state of New York that Dave
leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided that we were going to do
a more in-depth analysis of New York soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to relate that also to the
different cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we tease some of that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is what Joe Joseph did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, we basically wanted to tease
out sort of a genetic difference in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it a clay loam versus a silt loam
versus a loam?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the management aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Joseph separated out five different
systems because we could do that based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop code that came with the sample
submission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dairy, pasture, mixed vegetable,
processing vegetable, and annual crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So processing vegetable and annual crops
tend to be more conventional systems where
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the carbon and nutrients is
harvested and exported often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dairy, of course, tends to have an
excess of carbon and nutrients because not
[SPEAKER_00]: only do they cycle the crops on the farm,
you know, they harvest alfalfa and the
[SPEAKER_00]: corn silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also bring typically feed in from
other places, sometimes from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pasture is a system where, of course,
you have a lot of cycling of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon and you don't disturb the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mixed vegetable is a lot of
those cases that tend to be smaller farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically organic farms where they grow a
lot of crops, typically for farm stands or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they sell it in New York City for
restaurants or places like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and these are typically organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use a lot of compost, especially
compost and cover crops to basically
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain the nutrients and the carbon on
their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they typically have, they are typically
a scenario where they bring in carbon and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from compost from other places,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first see what the differences
are between different textural classes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of, you know, because a lot
of the soils are in kind of medium
[SPEAKER_00]: texture, we just have coarse, two types of
medium and then fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that the soil organic matter,
for example, for coarse textured soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: only average 2.4 and then it goes all the
way up for a fine textured soil to 4.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do fine textured soils have more
organic matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have these bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the mineral bonds with the
organic matter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more clay you have, the more
potential for bonding with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it basically kind of seals in the
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of know that and that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see the same for active carbon more
or less, protein and respirator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that basically as the texture
is finer, more clay, you see higher
[SPEAKER_00]: values.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we interpret them differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Bob talked about yesterday
after lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at the effects of
different cropping systems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's start again with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the processing vegetables had the
lowest percentage of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then annual crop, more or less the
same number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy farms had on the average higher
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of manure that's being
recycled and all that, but they'd also
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to do quite a bit of tillage on these
dairy farms because they have to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: manure in the ground and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mixed vegetables, those are the cases
where typically they bring compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pastures was the highest,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these numbers, so you're talking
almost, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% more organic matter in the pastures
than in the, sorry, I'm kind of in the way
[SPEAKER_00]: there, than the crops where you remove
most of the carbon and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is that for active carbon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, more or less similar numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein, yep, similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respiration, okay, about doubling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available water capacity, not as much
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go from 0.2 to 0.25.
[SPEAKER_00]: But agribusability, a lot of change,
you almost triple the stability of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregates in a pasture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have cycling of carbon and no tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two things that impact the
aggregates the most, when you till it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bad for aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you don't cycle carbon,
it's bad for the aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that if you say, a farmer is in
a say corn-soybean rotation, your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation of the health of their soil
should be different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't necessarily, so for a
dairy farmer, if their organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: or let's say mixed vegetable farmers,
their organic matter level is around four,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, oh, that's sort of average,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a processing vegetable,
if they're at four, that would be great
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're well above average,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another thing that we looked at,
and this is a little bit of a statistical
[SPEAKER_00]: trick, it's called variance component
analysis, where you basically say,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of the variance is associated
with the inherent properties, the texture?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is associated with the management
or the cropping system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these numbers add up to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at the total variability
in the system, and for soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, about an equal amount of the
variation is associated with either
[SPEAKER_00]: texture or cropping system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tells you something, because for
example, when we're doing soil mapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're mapping these inherent, we were
talking about that yesterday morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: these inherent soil properties,
we have to consider what kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping system is that soil in,
because it's just as important,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: About the same for active carbon,
I give them a similar color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for these labile organic matter
indicators, protein, respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: and aggregate stability, most of the
variation was associated with cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as much the inherent differences in
soil type from texture, but more how is
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil managed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, from the North Carolina
study, these indicators were very strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: related to yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of all those other indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, available water capacity is primarily
defined by texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it the clay, is it the sand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe how you manage it is not all
that much impacted, or doesn't all that
[SPEAKER_00]: much impact the available water capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of this is maybe two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, we're learning a lot about soil
health and what impacts soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, is this issue of we have to think of
the anthropogenic impacts on soils from
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping systems as being a very important
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when we think of a soil and we look
at a soil map, at least the way the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: map currently is, we don't have all the
information yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a honey oil silt loam,
which is the state soil for New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a dairy farm is not gonna be the same
as a honey oil silt loam on a cash grain
[SPEAKER_00]: operation or a mixed vegetable operation,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to start it's like saying
humans, you're human, but you're not sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of recognizing the individuality of each
person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just generalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing then that Joseph and I
kind of worked on and said, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing maybe that we can start doing is
to set goals, we call them aspirational
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know what kind of a cropping
system you're in, we can say, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're an annual crop, that you should
be able to achieve 3.2% organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's actually the 75th
percentile of the distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can say, this is a health goal that
you can aspire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that health goal would be different
for a cash grain operation than a dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or mixed vegetable operation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're saying if you are below,
if you're a corn and soybean farmer in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, and you're below 3.2%, you can do
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying you should become 5%
because that would be unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be okay for mixed vegetable
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a cash grain operation,
you should be able to reach that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really important from our
perspective because we do the same with
[SPEAKER_00]: water quality and air quality,
we set these goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set nitrate in groundwater,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, if you're above that, we consider
that to be a problem, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory implications are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to start saying, okay,
if you're this kind of a farmer and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get this kind of a soil health report,
this is where we think you could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe your potassium level in your
blood or cholesterol level, we could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is a reasonable point for
you to reach, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gets us actually to another point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, there's a lot of
interest around carbon farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually here in New York,
there's people in Albany in our capital
[SPEAKER_00]: that are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're starting to look at with
our data is to say, look, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain soils that have very little carbon
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may see that as a glass more or
less empty, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one of those corn and soybean
operations that have maybe let's say 2.7%
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, well, you have quite a bit of
opportunity to bring up that organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter level, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because the storage capacity in the
soil is mostly empty or close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is maybe more severely graded
environment, maybe in Africa or someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is maybe a cash grain farm where
you say, yeah, there's some organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, but you still have, you can still
fill up the glass more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna do carbon farming and you
want to sequester carbon into the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can solve the greenhouse gas
problem, then going to a cash grain farm
[SPEAKER_00]: would probably be good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if for some reason you can get
compost or manure on it, it will stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of the livestock farms they
basically already have very high organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter levels and they're maybe exceeding
the storage capacity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass is half full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put more manure or compost onto
those soils, but you're gonna lose it
[SPEAKER_00]: because the glass is already full,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been the organic matter is
mostly gonna just be going off as carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide and the nutrients are just going
to accumulate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're saying, oh, we're gonna have
a program on carbon farming here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, you should think about what kind of
soils and cropping system you're in so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't say, oh, I'm gonna start
subsidizing dairy farmers to do carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because they already have too much
carbon on their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their glass is already full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on these farms or maybe even those
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Joseph's analysis of,
you can look at what is the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation level for these five different
cropping systems from our soil database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that the annual crops,
the corn, soybean, wheat, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: processing vegetables, most of them are
well below that saturation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the glass half empty scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to apply more compost or
manure onto the soils, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: great, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the soils can take it,
they can store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that the pastures,
the mixed vegetables, some of those farms
[SPEAKER_00]: already are saturated with carbon and
nutrients typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shouldn't be spending money on
encouraging those people to do carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: farming because they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are already at capacity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, by the way, is the equation that
we're using, which is sort of the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: most people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ability of the soil to store carbon
is related to the sand, to the silt and
[SPEAKER_00]: clay content, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph, should I maybe stop or I'm gonna
skip this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 10 more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, I'm gonna skip Rintaro's work,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we also were
interested in is can we make our soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health test better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been doing it and we
actually had been improving it for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things is if you develop a
simple soil health test, and Bob talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about that a little bit yesterday,
what are the most informative kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones have we just already learned
about this morning, which were really good
[SPEAKER_00]: indicators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones that related to yield and
all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Active carbon, protein and all that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already have some idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, maybe there's a term that many of
you are not familiar with, but can we
[SPEAKER_00]: estimate one indicator from the other
indicators?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're already measuring the other
indicators, can we estimate one from the
other?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, can we use reflectance
spectroscopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of Dave's PhD students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we did what's called the
best substance analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, if you measure only one
indicator, which one is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: informative?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out to be active carbon,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at all the indicators that
we measure and the overall soil health
[SPEAKER_00]: score that you get from that, if you only
measured active carbon, you capture 60% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because only one measurement, and it's a
really easy measurement to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe about $1,500 in equipment,
maybe $2,000, and pretty quickly done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that there was a really good
correlation with yield as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real winner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, okay, I'm willing to measure
two indicators, active carbon and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, what would be best?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get better prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say, I'm willing to measure three
indicators, active carbon, organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all sort of biological
indicators, lay-by organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: total organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then four indicators, then accurate
stability comes into that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way, this is good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to do a really quick and
inexpensive sort of health test,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can measure active carbon,
and you can actually get a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that Joseph worked on,
we said, have you guys seen the AWC yet or
[SPEAKER_00]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So available water capacity requires these
pressure plates, and it's about a $50,000
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had it in my lab because I'm a sort of
physicist, and you have to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really, if you set up a sort of
health lab, here's $50,000, active carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: is $2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a lengthy procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes what we do about a week,
I think, Bob, for the... And so it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pain in the behind kind of
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see that it doesn't seem to
relate all that well to cropping systems
[SPEAKER_00]: or management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly defined by texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joseph did a random forest analysis,
which is a machine learning methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to predict available water
capacity really well, with very low
[SPEAKER_00]: variability, as long as we measured these
other things, sand, silt, organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: clay, protein, respiration, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ones that are on top,
like sand, silt, and organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and clay, they were the best predictors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically now said, look,
we don't need to measure available water
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can basically estimate it from
everything else that we measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we save ourselves a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically implemented that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a few clients who insist on
us using the pressure plates, but for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else, I think, Bob, we now put
on the report, we say estimated or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really useful information for
us, saving us a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joseph also looked into aggregate
stability and found maybe somewhat similar
[SPEAKER_00]: result, not quite as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that protein, ACEs protein,
and then organic matter and clay and
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration were the biggest indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided not to estimate aggregate
stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still actually measuring it with the
rainfall simulator set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could, if you really wanted to
save money and have a really streamlined
[SPEAKER_00]: soil health assessment, you could actually
estimate aggregate stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Sonam Sherpa, who was a PhD
student with Dave here, who actually
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with the Kellogg Soil Lab,
the NRCS Soil Lab in Lincoln, Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of good data on using
mid-infrared reflectance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you're not actually doing any wet
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just measuring the reflectance
properties, the light reflectance
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can basically look at the colors,
but you go into actually measuring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sonam actually did some very
interesting work in terms of comparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: errors that you have with this technique
versus the errors that you get with
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically found that, especially for
carbon and nitrogen and clay content as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you could do just as well doing a
very rapid mid-infrared reflectance
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement as actually measuring it in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another opportunity to speed up
the assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of conclusions overall,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I really want you to take
away is that these anthropogenic spatial
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, whether we bring in manure or
compost from one place to another or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we export grain from a corn field
and soybean operation in China or Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually does have an impact on soil
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and we've now learned a lot about by
doing these measurements and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: using experiments, we're really getting a
lot of insights in terms of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: important in soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first set of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also, and this is maybe something a
little further out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have these differences,
say, between livestock farms like a dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: farm in New York and a cash grain
operation or corn and soybean wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that means that those soils are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we start to do agronomic
research, if we want to learn about what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of nitrogen response you get or what
kind of tillage response you get,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are different soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start taking that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't necessarily generalize and say,
do your research on our research farm
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Near the campus and that field never
received manure and say, oh, we can really
[SPEAKER_00]: just translate that to a field on a dairy
farm or a field on a mixed vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: operation that receives a lot of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to start to become a little bit
more nuanced about the type of research
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, earlier you talked about the
Montfort regional studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have known these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah, I can go back to that real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, but I have a very general question.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, this is just for
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What tools, environmental factors,
ambient temperature, precipitation and
[SPEAKER_03]: other play on the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is what sort of
environmental circumstances impact soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this, you know, soil health
differences due to climate, due to
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation, due to topography,
where on the landscape you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a confluence zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, you know, on a hillside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, of course, makes a big
difference, parent material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this area here, of course,
we had a lot of, we had glaciation also in
[SPEAKER_00]: upstate New York, and we had a lot of,
you know, impact from that in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are, and we call that corp,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate, landscape position, organisms,
you know, what kind of vegetation,
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation and temperature,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that defines the initial
quality of the soil, the natural quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we basically see that under
agricultural development, that additional
[SPEAKER_00]: factor comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a livestock operation,
you tend to maintain or maybe even go up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a cash grain operation
and row crop production, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this complex interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does mean that, you know,
if we interpret soil health data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, a soil in say Alabama is
not the same as a soil in Iowa to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could make an Alabama soil better
than an Iowa soil, but that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make them, you can really degrade
an Iowa soil and you can make an Alabama
[SPEAKER_00]: soil much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the average, of course,
the Alabama soils will be different than
[SPEAKER_00]: say the Iowa soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually, we didn't really have
enough data to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started out with, you know,
just one set of scoring functions that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use to interpret the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on this study, we said,
well, we need different interpretations
[SPEAKER_00]: for Midwestern soils than the
Mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our paper, actually,
those numbers are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because we've collected samples from
all over the country, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to say, you know, Southeastern soils
need this kind of an interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwestern soils need that kind of an
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the process of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that NRCS has may be aware of is
major land resource area and regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, region R up in the Northeast,
it covers parts of Northwest and Northeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania that have been emplaciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have similar climate,
similar soil, similar agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, that would be a better way,
I believe, to stratify this instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, the state line,
the soils don't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use these MLRA regions,
they're broader still, but yet have
[SPEAKER_01]: similar soils and climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a way to stratify and
look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that because that's
exactly what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at these major land
resource areas or the LLRs, the land
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the higher one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a higher level of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, that's how our soils,
when we're looking at, as a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist, I'm a major land resource area
soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover the glaciated Allegheny Plateau
and then the glaciated Lake Erie Plateau.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our way that we manage soils now is
based on these MLRAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're completely aligned on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one more quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the North Carolina study,
did you say that the tillage increased
[SPEAKER_02]: protein?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, well, with less tillage, we had
higher protein levels.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now keep in mind, it's an association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not saying that it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, we have higher protein
levels when we reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we can say at this point in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a pretty good idea because
proteins are a very labile form of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, they very easily decompose as a
supposed to say lignin, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to decompose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you till the soil, then these
readily decomposable organic materials are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be decomposed more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way it makes sense that if you
don't till, you protect more of that
[SPEAKER_00]: protein in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hypothesis that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that would be an interesting
thing to study further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at this point in time,
we're just learning so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just things that we never measured before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say like, wow, that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Joseph, back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
