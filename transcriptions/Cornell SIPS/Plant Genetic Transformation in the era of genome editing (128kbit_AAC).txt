[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Adam, for the kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have never been in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the place that every plant
scientist want to be and want to visit,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dream come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, why there's two screens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Video.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today, I'm going to talk about three
aspects of my research here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is the Center for Plant
Transformation at Iowa State University,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically a service center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my research aspect in the
agricultural and as well as nanoparticle
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery, non-DNA molecule delivery in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few slides I maybe rushed
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I apologize for that if you get
confused of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, talking about plant
transformation facility at Iowa State
[SPEAKER_01]: University, which was established 20 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, I left my university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry job, where I used to be colleague
with Josh Rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from ICI-Gaust and moved to Iowa State
University, take a position to run a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That time, the facility was basically was
supported by endowment grant from
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the commodity group, which
heavily behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also from administrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: A unit of the cows and plant
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very similar situation like today
that we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, we have five permanent
staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot, full time staff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have corn transformation specialist,
soybean transformation specialist,
[SPEAKER_01]: rice transformation specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all, one person, start from the
very beginning to the end of the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not have hourly students.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work everything alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just simple one person project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a lab manager who does
some molecular biology work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a greenhouse,
dedicated greenhouse manager who do
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing but taking care of the corn and
soybean and rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, together with myself,
we run the corn and soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have only three crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focused, a very focused project on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our transformation facility is under a
plant science institute, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella institute, covers the following
centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genomics, bioinformatics, plant
transformation, breeding, and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: few two centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we operate somewhat autonomous,
but same time we get support from plant
[SPEAKER_01]: science institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also under the umbrella of the
office of biotechnology, which runs all
[SPEAKER_01]: the infrastructure and the centralizing
the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genomic informatics, flow cytometry,
hybridoma, microscope, nano image,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very similar to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are the one of the 12 core facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these two units support collectively
one FTE here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the past 20 years, we have served
35 internal crop group, and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: corn, soybean, rice faculty researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have 161 external groups from
121 institutions from 16 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically everybody who does corn and
soybean, not rice, rice a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: can do themselves, corn and soybean come
to our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Majority, at least 70 to 80% of the
research in the field does that,
[SPEAKER_01]: receive service from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a summary of the growth,
all our capacity on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other hand, of over the year of our
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see at the beginning,
we creeping through all the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then nobody knows us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after all these years,
and then we are reaching really our
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity for three staff member.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we can add more people if they,
but the cost we want to keep down is we
[SPEAKER_01]: keep really quality staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our staff are really very experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are PhD level of scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they provide service.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, they always tweaking the
conditions, always comparing different
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here the home transformation just shows
how the plant in our greenhouse look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really admire Cornell's greenhouse
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: This afternoon, I toured the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I can't say enough good things
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so clean and so well organized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have those incubator was the
60s, 70s, 1970s vintage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were well, well kept,
which means that they say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very energy costing unit,
but they are so well maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of a unit, a lot of institution,
you will see institutions that cannot keep
[SPEAKER_01]: more than five years because nobody take
care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just get, you know, rotten and then
be abused by the students and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here it's a really amazing
infrastructure for the growth and really
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do two type of a main transformation
and then high two and then B104.
[SPEAKER_01]: High two is a lab line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then which is not very good for
agronomic purpose, but it's a good enough
[SPEAKER_01]: for study some basic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then transformation is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why high two has been a working
horse in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but later on we were able to get
a B104 transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then B104 is a quite good inbred and it's
a major inbred based on the B73.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of genomics can be done with this
B104.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the transformation frequency for
these two crops varies a lot, which cause
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference in the price as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when sometime the faculty like to use
B104 for transformation, but the price why
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the another things when
you are working with very cost of trend
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and sometime and you have to face the
price issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: For soybean transformation and the half
seed method was actually invented during
[SPEAKER_01]: the time when I after the arrived Iowa
State University and soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation pattern has been
established long time in the late 80s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but still very, very low frequency and
very difficult to transfer a technique to
[SPEAKER_01]: the other person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really well versed with
cell biology in order to run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my effort, this invention particularly
is skill transfer friendly means that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those basic knowledge, if a high school
student was able to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: protocol and do exactly what was
demonstrated, they are able to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: transgenic soybean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the skill is not really quite important
for the people to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very important if you want to
have your technology expanded and then be
[SPEAKER_01]: benefiting more than only just one,
your lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so soybean transformation,
we have these protocol and it's working
[SPEAKER_01]: very well, but it's very to our capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then finally, it's a rice
transformation, which we basically do the
[SPEAKER_01]: japonica right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rice transformation, both in the bone
bearer and then Kataki using the pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: standard and public protocol and works
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the rice is not as difficult
compared to recost trend corn and then
[SPEAKER_01]: soybean here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people can actually establish for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the key limitation with our
facility after 10, 20 years of working on
[SPEAKER_01]: this service facility and I would say
first of all is the lack of our greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we have only 3000 square feet
and probably really the growth space is
[SPEAKER_01]: less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3000 square feet in this case is wall to
wall space.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to Andy for the greenhouse
analysis, these are much less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to grow corn year round in order
to provide a starting material,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is immature embryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to grow soybean to
maturity in order to get the seeds for the
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to grow transgenic corn to
seeds for the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we cannot afford anymore because
there's no space simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just have to beg all our colleagues
to take the transgenic plantlet and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in your own greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very difficult for oversea
business and for Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Austria, for Belgium, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We successfully sending all these
transgenic plantlets across Atlanta,
[SPEAKER_01]: no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we want to send to Mexico,
even on the same continent, we face very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very challenging customer issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really just basically we cannot
overcome things we cannot control over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another major issue is recruit
and retain high quality staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three staff which has been with me
for 20 years and 10, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of young staff going through
and then two or three years later they are
[SPEAKER_01]: gone for a variety of reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of industry does try to recruit
our staff because we do provide very good
[SPEAKER_01]: training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, and because there's
no such a training from master degree or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever undergraduate cell biology
anymore, so we seldom can find anybody who
[SPEAKER_01]: is able to jump into the transformation
and then taking project and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why our staff has been steady
but same time we become worried because we
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get any younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to have a next generation who is
able to do the same job or even better
[SPEAKER_01]: than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the issue we are all facing,
every facility, public institution facing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, same as Pioneer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to build a robot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not joking when I'm saying this
because the camera imaging system and
[SPEAKER_01]: computer system can allow us to identify
the type of characteristic, allow us to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick those type of the thing, recognize
and pick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing if you want to think
about reducing transformation costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to invest into working with
mechanical engineering, computer
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists and then cell biology and then
to build up a robot that will do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you will always cry and 20 years
ago I think this, I thought this would be
[SPEAKER_01]: solved by now, 20 years later I'm still
facing this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So okay, instead of crying over we
probably think creatively using the new
[SPEAKER_01]: technology let's build something we can do
transformation fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sequencing, think about
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years or 30 years ago we had to
sequence ourselves manually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This revolutionized our sequencing
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never imagined this could happen but
that's a reality now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of limited staff and limited
infrastructure and restrict our ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: research to improve transformation
frequency and then at the beginning of our
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment facility I was able to
actually working to improve efficiency but
[SPEAKER_01]: then when we become popular we are so
overwhelmed by all these orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no time and we have no material
even to use for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's major issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every facility they want to start their
service they have to include the research
[SPEAKER_01]: component into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how much about transformation
service part and I can't afford to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we are going to talk about a
little bit more in detail but I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: come to the second aspect of my research
on the non-coding RNA in AgroBacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew up with AgroBacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my graduate study and I was thrown
into AgroBacteria world but after my PhD
[SPEAKER_01]: postdoc I was totally sick and tired of
AgroBacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have anything to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to use that to transform
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because also partially I thought
AgroBacteria, everybody knows every bits
[SPEAKER_01]: of AgroBacteria anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing left for us to study.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back now six, seven years ago I had a
very weird conversation with Stan Garvin
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have worked on the NSF project and
I had a conversation with Luis Herrera who
[SPEAKER_01]: was my peer colleague in graduate student
time about AgroBacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were asking how much do we really know
about AgroBacteria and do we really know
[SPEAKER_01]: every gene of AgroBacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: If people try to knock out every single
gene of Arabidopsis I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody has knocked out every single gene
of AgroBacteria in order to know the
[SPEAKER_01]: function of the gene and then to see if we
can use this organism for any more
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation frequency improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we started a random project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just sequence the transcriptome of
that because everybody was sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, and plus I have a good friend
in Illumina.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have friends in important
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, well, just threw me in
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just run it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wow, that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: With no support and that's your friend who
will help you to float, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So see, this is Illumina's colleague's
name on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We designed experiments together and at
that time even Illumina never have dealt
[SPEAKER_01]: with bacteria transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very exciting for them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we published one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just used their very new technology at
that time and then managed to identify a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of, so we had total of 848 billion
reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very high throughput compared to
454 that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 454 still is an important workhorse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend there is saying that,
okay, look, we can generate a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: reads for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so we got a lot of those data and
we used our, we worked with our
[SPEAKER_01]: bioinformatics professor colleague on
campus and was able to uniquely map,
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the uniquely mapped transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that we try to evaluate
is that, okay, we check our VIR operon.
[SPEAKER_01]: VIR, VIR operon is a group of a gene,
which is very important for bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: media transformation, DNA transformation,
because they will only activate during the
[SPEAKER_01]: time they interact with plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So S.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: syringer is a plant signal molecule which
induce this agro-bacterial gene come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see these red peaks,
those are the VIR gene which induced by
[SPEAKER_01]: agro-bacterial, by the plant signal
molecule S.O.
[SPEAKER_01]: syringer and blue are the no-inducers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at all these
transcriptome, they say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, hey, that's really what we have
known for all these years.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very highly induced and some of
them are not and then to our surprise,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we find there's a bunch of cis
antisense, which sometimes non-induced,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes induced and then that,
you know, immediately was very interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: for us, because the cis antisense on the
VIR, on this inducible important gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are they, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we characterize most of those
identified non-coding RNA, they are range
[SPEAKER_01]: from 0 to 521 nucleotides and average
length is 88 nucleotides and the median
[SPEAKER_01]: length is 61, that's their characteristic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 88% of the small RNA are on two
chromosome, which is not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: In agro-bacterial, they have a big
circular chromosome and linear chromosome
[SPEAKER_01]: and then two plasmids and the Ti plasmid
is the one, is most important to us for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant transformation, because the
transfer DNA is on this plasmid and V gene
[SPEAKER_01]: is on this plasmid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then 87% of antisense RNA are on the
two plasmids and 18 are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: complementary strain of VABDEFK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the characteristic which we
found is quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the first thing, the next thing we
were asking is that, okay, cis antisense,
[SPEAKER_01]: easily you could think cis antisense
probably are regulating the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite to theirs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So do they have really targeting trans or
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we did this analysis on
transcriptome and we found out they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually do not correlate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the expression of the opposite strain
of the gene the transcripts, they are not
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated with their particular
expression of the antisense, I mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: small RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they are doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my students, Abby Johnson,
decided to focus on that the small RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite to the C1 and C2 gene on the Ti
plasmid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at this VA operon,
and you will notice most of VA genes on
[SPEAKER_01]: the opposite strain, on the top strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And C1 and C2 are the two gene which only
these two on the opposite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So itself is already weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this C1, C2 has a very strong
expression of antisense in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is C?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the VSC operon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know anything about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's a bunch of study had done a
while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never paid attention to VSC1 and C2
because I think from literature people
[SPEAKER_01]: always think that, yeah, it doesn't really
abolishing the pathogenesis or virulence,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's rather just attenuates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, do you agree on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these publications just say that,
yeah, it's lead to reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during my time, and if anything is not
black and white, I was not interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be black and white, and that's
easy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can publish science, nature,
black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's in between, you don't go very
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of things is in between,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at the V or C
transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see there are transcripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see one transcript is highly induced
by S0 syringine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the red peak come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But VSC2 seem to be not very enthusiastic
after induction, at least in the condition
[SPEAKER_01]: we have been testing over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: VSC2 is always very low peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you look at the anti-VSC2,
and then you see that region, the opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: This anti-C2 is predominantly exactly
opposite of the C2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's not much of anti-C1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is this transcriptome wide of
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a pattern we are seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hypothesis is, OK, VSC2 antisense
is maybe regulating VSC2 sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that contributes to the low
frequency or low expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we did some correlation analysis,
expression analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found out the VSC2 and anti-VSC2
actually correlated very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a more VSC2, you have a more
anti-C2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well correlated and doesn't look
like the expression of anti-VSC2
[SPEAKER_01]: downregulates VSC2.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it's like the more of this
and more of that, it's like more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilizer rather than destabilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a thing we are still addressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then Abby did some knockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because studying antisense smartly is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you cannot delete them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You delete them, you delete the gene
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really delete gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot knock out using conventional
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Abby tried to look at the upstream of
this anti-VSC2.
[SPEAKER_01]: She found that there's a putative promoter
region of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she then messed up a little bit of the
promoter region, delete that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just delete a little bit of this area
and see what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after deletion, and then she found her
anti-VSC2 transcript reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her VSC2 transcript reduced as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the correlation still goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you reduce VSC2 antisense,
you reduce VSC2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seemed to be there is this still
positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of a negative downregulates that,
there's something anti-VSC2, the function.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't know what is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So possible explanation is antisense VSC2
is bind to the sense transcript and
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilize it post transcriptionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then could be the regulation of the C2
is during the transcription.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those things are still not very
clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then another things we want to do is
say, OK, after you mess around this
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-VSC2 region, do you get this
virulence level down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have any impact on virulence?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing, usually,
antibacterial people always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you mess around with a strand,
you first want to see, OK, did you make
[SPEAKER_01]: any impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any impact on the virulence?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then in this case, we use this
calanquiri model plant, a typical assay
[SPEAKER_01]: system that we use for antibacterial
virulence assay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Abby inoculated two strands.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is her deletion mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a wild type, this calanquiri leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after two weeks, she assay for
the tumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she sees this reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reduced phenotype of her strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wild type has a lot of tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This mutant strand does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the mall,
you see it's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the best representative.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just publish that, you say,
oh my god, this is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know better now after 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot just say, oh, here, yeah,
this is what we expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where the complication is.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, do we really see the true attenuation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's just a random plant response to
the virulence, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because we don't have anything
better than just do a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we start to do a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, we just define the
virulence by zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: No response at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a little bit of response to number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two and three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things where typically we
just qualitatively characterize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then after that, then we again count
how many of number one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you measure those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see how many of those
actually scored a zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many scored one and how many
scored three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like here, the wild type and
score zero, you have less of a wild type.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have more of a mutant strain scored
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have more of a wild type
scored number three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is still very qualitative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she did a statistic analysis on
this man, Whitney, ranked summer test
[SPEAKER_01]: using this for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so she had a hypothesis is a mean
ranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two samples are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the alternate hypothesis is a mean
ranked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two samples are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So according to her analysis here is the
hypothesis, alternate hypothesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably true here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's again, to us, I do not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I read this data, I say, oh,
yeah, there's probably difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do these really tell us anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: But most important things we want to study
is what really that anti-C2 has effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: C2 or any other genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the subsequent experiment we are doing
right now is do this RNA stabilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: stability analysis, and then also use more
of the quantitative analysis to see
[SPEAKER_01]: whether there is any difference in these
two different strains or different small
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have other small RNA also in the
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them actually affecting the
quorum sensing and the conjugation and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitivity towards pH as well as
temperature and those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as most of the non-coding RNA now
finding, there are other findings on
[SPEAKER_01]: tuning of their response to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that makes sense, some of
those bacterial fitness affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: small RNA or the small RNA regulating the
bacterial fitness in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now to the third aspect of my talk is
about using the nanotechnology for the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-DNA molecule delivery in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a collaboration between my lab
and with a group in chemistry department
[SPEAKER_01]: in Iowa State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was led by Victor Lin that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he, unfortunately, passed away
five years ago in the middle of our
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was continued by two of his
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian Twain right now is a faculty in
Colorado School of Mine and continued the
[SPEAKER_01]: nanoparticle research in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that biological experiment was done by
my postdoc, Francois Tony, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Susanna Martin-Otegosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically at that time, and Dr. Lin had
synthesized a material called mesoporous
[SPEAKER_01]: silico nanoparticle, which has a very
interesting structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a highly regulated material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does not found in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most important is that inside there's
a very large internal pore space allow you
[SPEAKER_01]: to incorporate or upload payload protein
or molecules that you want to carry using
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this has also very interesting
surface structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really surface functionalize with
a different molecule in order for it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: a different application purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, all this part, I'm not able
to go detail with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all very chemical for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one other aspect of this silico
nanoparticle is that you can feel it with
[SPEAKER_01]: a small molecule by simple diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can covalently attach the whole
pore, in this case that this molecule we
[SPEAKER_01]: put to stop this leaky from a pore,
the gold small particle, which covalently
[SPEAKER_01]: link to the surface of the nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then upon change of pH or the
induction of the chemical in the medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can open up the pore and then
have the molecule release from inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is this type of feature that I was
interested in to use for the delivery for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant molecule that I do not want to
have them immediately release that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back 2005, we started this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2007, we succeeded to introduce a
DNA which is coded outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But inside of the pore of a mesoporous
nanoparticle, we loaded with inducible
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we shoot these two substance on
the same nanoparticle into plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually add reagent in the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had the pore open, release the
molecule inside of a mesoporous
[SPEAKER_01]: nanoparticle, and then get a gene
expression from the DNA that we
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really the first case that we
were able to demonstrate that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: more than one way of introducing DNA or
non-DNA molecule into plant, and then make
[SPEAKER_01]: them do the things that we want them to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will give us a lot of versatility
in a lot of delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the MSN over the current
transformation system can do is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can deliver more than one biogenic species
at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our first paper, we demonstrate that we
can deliver a gene and an effector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And effector at that time was a chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: A small chemical molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can deliver gene and enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can deliver RNA and protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can deliver multiple substance in this
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage of use specific molecule for
in this case is these molecule are
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulated and you can control release.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you don't want them to release
all the time at all the stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing advantage of
using this particular MSN is that surface
[SPEAKER_01]: can be functionalized to target a desired
cell or tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after this project published,
immediately, really literally the same day
[SPEAKER_01]: we get a phone call from Pioneer saying,
well, can you deliver something else than
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they start to collaborate with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say, well, we need to deliver a protein
or recombinase in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR was not that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even talent wasn't even in the research
area as hot as today yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their idea is, again, actually genome
editing was not new at all back a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time ago that people has been always
trying to find the way that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically target a specific area to
make changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the protein delivery in genome editing
time has some advantage over the DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a DNA-free technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to create expression, expressing
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to segregate progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And transient activity could reduce
toxicity and off-target mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, I think it does save
time in an analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the con, the disadvantage of that is
you need to have a protein purified in
[SPEAKER_01]: this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purified DNA is a lot easier to purify
protein and to get a lot of protein
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to assess the protein activity is not
always easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have protein quantity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know if the protein has
enzymatic activity that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the efficiency comparing to DNA
expression is, in our case, low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the last thing, the most
important, is that after protein delivery,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you select those actually edited?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the issues for protein
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here it illustrates what we are
currently using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our DNA delivery system, you have a
plasmid which carries nucleus in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do a regular genetic
transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, you will have the enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have this enzyme work in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made the plant change into the
desired place you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that plant still carries enzyme,
which you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get rid of those enzymes,
and typically what we do, we will do the
[SPEAKER_01]: self-pollination or cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have a segregation for the
next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you will find out the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use PCL and other methods to identify
those plants which has your edited genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do not carry the undesired nucleus
gene anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what currently we are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not too bad, but it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideal situation is that if we are
able to just directly introduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleus using MSN, or use some other
delivery method, and into the cone plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one step, you should get the edited
plant, but without your nucleus,
[SPEAKER_01]: because protein will not last there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is ideal situation if we want to
get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So okay, starting 2009,
[SPEAKER_01]: we started to say, okay, can we deliver
protein?
[SPEAKER_01]: We never tried protein, honestly,
until that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we purchased some eGFP and put them
together with the nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also tried to code the
nanoparticle with a DNA, express R for P,
[SPEAKER_01]: mCherry in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking for the cell,
in this case, onion cell, which express
[SPEAKER_01]: both red and have a green color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green is simply the presence of the GFP
released from the nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red has to be the DNA which carried
through the nanoparticle, but express in
[SPEAKER_01]: this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately after that, we will say,
okay, why don't we just start to try this
[SPEAKER_01]: recombination?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pioneer provided us with a Cray
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you can buy it commercially,
Cray protein, and then you load them onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I want to have to emphasize
that part of the thing I did not talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about is optimization of nanoparticle
bombardment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nanoparticle was made by silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to bombard silica,
and that's just too light to be
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our chemist group managed to gold
plated the silica with several layers of a
[SPEAKER_01]: gold particle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is a silica before plating,
and this is after six times of gold
[SPEAKER_01]: plating.
[SPEAKER_01]: The TEM and SEM scanning microscope shows
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same thing, but this is TEM
scanning, this is SEM scanning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is to have this gold plated
and then load it with a protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cray protein, and at the same time,
Pioneer provided us with a transgenic maze
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That transgenic maze line carried this
single gene insertion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This single gene insertion looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A promoter drives a GAT gene, which is a
glyphosate resistant, this is a selectable
[SPEAKER_01]: marker, and you have a promoter drive the
sign CFP, blue protein, and you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of a red fluorescence protein,
and then in between, you have a LOXP,
[SPEAKER_01]: LOXP here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, if the Cray protein is
working, that two LOXP will recombine,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then this promoter will start to drive
the DS gene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a pump embankment, if the Cray
protein is delivered into this blue
[SPEAKER_01]: transgenic cone, we should see some sector
of the red cell, because this is because
[SPEAKER_01]: of a Cray protein is working, and then
make the LOXP recombine, and then delete
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle part of the segment,
the blue gene deleted, and red gene hooked
[SPEAKER_01]: up with promoter and express.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we actually find,
that we were able to see transgenically,
[SPEAKER_01]: the red, and then the stable red cone
callus, and then you have this segregating
[SPEAKER_01]: red callus, the cone callus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, half of them are the blue,
and half of them are the red, chimerism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have also this tassel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an original transgenic cone,
you can see it's blue, it shines in the
[SPEAKER_01]: blue channel, but not in the red channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is after recombine, the blue color is
gone, and the red expressed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recombinates working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grand finale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we take all these recombination,
recombine the lines, and then make the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing, and then they really had a
beautiful, precise excision, every single
[SPEAKER_01]: line of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these, the original, the sequence and
application, after the LOXP recombine,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuse together, and then these are the
protein bombarded line, and these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: plasmid bombarded line, because we also
introduced DNA as our control.
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA introduced the line, and then protein
introduced the line, they result the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was quite fun things to do,
and we show that we can deliver protein
[SPEAKER_01]: and recombination recombinates and then
make it working in the plant and exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the place it's supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one illustration, all the
demonstration of the protein can be
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered for future nuclear-aided genome
editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very final five minutes about,
okay, MS delivery, and it's great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has this disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the problem here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have advantage is that control relief,
and the major advantage that we use this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular type of nanoparticle is the
pore size limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after we deliver a query protein,
everybody is happy, and same time
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody starts to say, oh, that's too
small the size, because the pore size is
[SPEAKER_01]: only 10 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the highest we can push with the
current formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we are going to deliver Talon or
the CRISPR, all of them are much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than the pore allow us to upload.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also this encapsulate the protein
release maybe too slow for us what we
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the same time, they will say,
okay, well, nanoparticles are great,
[SPEAKER_01]: and can we think about something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's something else, as we coined
it, we call it, it's called proteolystic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bombard method for intracellular
delivery of protein only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we just simply modify our
current DNA delivery system by
[SPEAKER_01]: lignophilizing the protein, or air dry the
protein onto the carrier, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: bombard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depends on protein we use, and we are
able to introduce a variety of the protein
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a GFP introduced, and we also
use a triti-labeled BSA, which is a rather
[SPEAKER_01]: large protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we use those things is because
they are cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are colorful and cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then BSA, GFP is way too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also bombard the GUS enzyme
that allow us to also be able to show that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually can turn the blue when you put a
substrate there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also bombard some of the
enzyme, such as the trypsin and the RNA-S,
[SPEAKER_01]: because once you bombard those destructive
enzyme, you should see the cell death in
[SPEAKER_01]: this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looks like we can bombard a variety of
the protein just by through the main.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things we have been
doing using the protein delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also bombard the animal tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, try to broaden our patent
claim, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just demonstrate that we can do it more
than on plant cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: These proteolytics can be used to
co-deliver DNA and protein at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very simple procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use a current existing gene gun,
and it's quite reproducible in our hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: No restriction on the protein type and can
deliver protein and enzyme with a
[SPEAKER_01]: different molecular weight and actual
electric point or the tertiary structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The major disadvantage to us is probably
you cannot control release.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bombard, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I will thank my colleagues
in the plant transformation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have a group of people who
work on small agroactive non-coding RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the nanoparticle work was a
collaboration with chemistry department,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as Pioneer, and our current
funding for these particular projects that
[SPEAKER_01]: come from internal and then Pioneer
collaboration project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have we thought about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually looked into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a read-through, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a quite significant and quite
clear stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't test this little promoter area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very nice promoter area,
but we don't know if it's a true restart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tested this area to promote or
not, but it's a potential promoter area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we try to decouple them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a promoter driver top path,
and then we have a promoter driving bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully that will help us
understand, because we cannot delete them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to overexpress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decouple them by driving top strand
bottom path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you achieved nuclear localization of
one of these radiolystically delivered
[SPEAKER_03]: proteins?
[SPEAKER_01]: We never try to test whether nuclear
localization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to put a nuclear localization
signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're talking about the protein.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks to me like they get in and
they diffuse around the cell, so I think
[SPEAKER_04]: they go into the nucleus just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never would actually look into whether
they are focusing on getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you expect the protein to go into the
nucleus?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just wondering.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to deliver Cas9,
it's got to get to the nucleus,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And whether that would go in by chance,
just by being bombarded all the way to the
[SPEAKER_04]: nuclear membrane?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably could just have a Cas9,
have a nuclear localization signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to think society together with
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they have that, for sure they will
go in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the B&E, whatever that near protein
that will have nuclear localization,
[SPEAKER_01]: the B&E-2 promoter will guide you into
higher efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
