[SPEAKER_03]: Our speaker today is Bob Schindlbeck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an extension associate in the
Department of Crop and Soil Science at
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell University with responsibilities
in research, teaching, and extension.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob coordinates the Cornell Soil Health
Laboratory Operations and has been part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Cornell Soil Health team's development
of soil management strategies to address
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory measured soil constraints.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's produced a number of peer-reviewed
and extension articles and has delivered
[SPEAKER_03]: over 200 presentations related to tillage,
soil compaction, and soil quality at
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer Twilight meetings and professional
conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob's going to talk to us today about soil
health management.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, Bob, I'm going to turn the
program over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everyone can hear me okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so two weeks ago, I kind of
introduced the Cornell Soil Health Test in
[SPEAKER_02]: a presentation called Applying the Cornell
Soil Health Test to Bury Production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to build on that today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The title of today's presentation is
Understanding the Soil, Biological and
[SPEAKER_02]: Physical Properties with a Special
Emphasis on the Management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So move forward here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about any sort of soil
management, we find it very useful to
[SPEAKER_02]: break the soil into, if you will,
these great groups of the physical,
[SPEAKER_02]: biological, and chemical properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason for that is that soil ecology
itself is exceedingly complex and full of
[SPEAKER_02]: so much interaction that our only chance
is to use the reductionist approach of
[SPEAKER_02]: science and kind of understand the little
bits and at the same time realize we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to put those little bits
back together into the whole ecological
[SPEAKER_02]: package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the strategy that we use
for understanding the soil itself as
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we take that sort of knowledge and
strategy and then manage the soil to
[SPEAKER_02]: manage these different properties of the
soil then to get the sort of interactions
[SPEAKER_02]: moving in the direction we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the power of management or wise
management is understanding what's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: beneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of model that strategy with
this with the approach I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this kind of visit in a nutshell here,
our philosophy really is that the healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: soil is balanced between the blue disc,
the yellow disc, and the green disc you
[SPEAKER_02]: see on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that as a three-legged stool of
these different soil properties that we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to understand what's going on in each
of these realms such that our stool is
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced and not weak at one place or
another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we talked about last week was
measuring different indicators in these
[SPEAKER_02]: different soil arenas to find out if we
have any limitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we take that same understanding of
perhaps impaired processes if they do
[SPEAKER_02]: exist and we when we manage the soil we
can address those ideally several at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've produced a caveat down here at
the bottom of this slide which kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: gets at really the underpinnings of all
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A person would say why would you want to
increase your soil health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well certainly it's at the very end of
things has to be money, increased
[SPEAKER_02]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be more successful with our
with our management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so again part one would be to identify
these soil limitations and then when we
[SPEAKER_02]: can understand it and see just what's
going on it gives us a chance to create
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities what I call for synergistic
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know there's a lot of work to do out
there and we want to make sure that all
[SPEAKER_02]: our all our steps all our all our
practices are addressing if if necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: several issues at once that need
addressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw this sort of strategy last week
the the main goals now using this Cornell
[SPEAKER_02]: soil health test which you see on the
right of the slide as we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand these different processes going
on in the soil and just just how just how
[SPEAKER_02]: our soils kind of doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing what these where these levels are
at find out where where we need really
[SPEAKER_02]: need to focus our attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then part two is where we'll spend our
time today or a lot of our time thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: how can we then develop management
strategies that are holistic that consider
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things simultaneously to restore
our soil function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll notice we have the the Cornell
soil health test report field management
[SPEAKER_02]: sheet at the bottom left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see some folks in a classroom
setting where we actually go through and
[SPEAKER_02]: we we practice this where we take a soil
health report like you see in the upper
[SPEAKER_02]: right and kind of break it down into four
steps and kind of tease out as much
[SPEAKER_02]: information as we can on this part one so
that we can develop again a sound manage
[SPEAKER_02]: sound and satisfying management strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you note the soil health report you see
in the upper right what we have here is a
[SPEAKER_02]: grower who had rye vetch three years ago
on a field and then two years of
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sandy loam soil and you can see
that there's some a couple of where you
[SPEAKER_02]: see these red scores we've outlined some
soil health constraints some soil
[SPEAKER_02]: processes that that aren't aren't quite up
to snuff that we could address to their
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll come back to this at the end of
the end of the talk and actually tease
[SPEAKER_02]: this apart and use this this four-step
strategy to kind of dissect this and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just give a an example dissection of the
information and a movement forward through
[SPEAKER_02]: through the four steps to a proposed
management strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so let me begin we're going to talk a
lot about organic matter today so this is
[SPEAKER_02]: a very useful slide to kind of put things
into our perspective of how we're of how
[SPEAKER_02]: we think about organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess this probably all makes sense
to us by now if you're interested in in
[SPEAKER_02]: soil processes but as we feed the soil
this organic matter we affect a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different processes and I've outlined here
in in blue soil physical processes that
[SPEAKER_02]: are directly affected by organic matter
modifications additions and
[SPEAKER_02]: transformations as well as in green some
soil biological processes that are
[SPEAKER_02]: directly affected by organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course these are in fact processes
that we test in the soil health analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one of these has a has an analysis
that gets gets right at these nuts and
[SPEAKER_02]: bolts of soil function but at the same
time now we need to think also as managers
[SPEAKER_02]: so when we say add organic matter and all
these processes that are affected well
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly different organic matter could
affect some of these processes more than
[SPEAKER_02]: other organic matter be the character of
the organic matter the age of it do we
[SPEAKER_02]: stir it in do we apply it to the surface
do we grow it in as a green manure etc so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that's where we'll where we'll go
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again it's a it asks for really holding
these processes in your mind that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going on in the soil simultaneous with the
idea of managing them with very outside
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil actions by a grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay so to step back a little bit the
there's some actors in this soil food web
[SPEAKER_02]: starting with organic matter on the far
left we've got living roots and shoots
[SPEAKER_02]: which they are organic matter not dead
organic matter but they're living organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and below that we see dead
substrate so we've got the source of all
[SPEAKER_02]: our soil biological processes really is is
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we we want to keep in mind that
these are quite variable we have different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that we can use in our management
different substrates that we can apply so
[SPEAKER_02]: when we look at this table we see that
from the blue circle the living material
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to affect certain living
bacteria and fungi and nematodes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and same at the bottom the dead
substrate can affect this this next box
[SPEAKER_02]: this next hierarchy of organisms but right
the fact that we can affect and promote
[SPEAKER_02]: certain of these organisms or actually
restrict them based on our choice of
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter forces us then as managers
to to be aware of of all the all the
[SPEAKER_02]: influence we can have by modifying what we
see at the far left the living and dead
[SPEAKER_02]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kind of put that in text here all
organic matter is not created equal I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: use this title on another slide later in
the talk to kind of bring this together
[SPEAKER_02]: once again but when we when we're dealing
with fresh material on this this could be
[SPEAKER_02]: additions like grass clippings or leaves
as well as growing cover crops the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: itself if you will green manure these
these compounds are very young and fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: and wet when organisms attack this and
when these products break down we get a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these glues if you will that help
bind the soil together we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: this with soil aggregate creation very
important even earthworms as they pull
[SPEAKER_02]: this material into the soil the goo and
glue on the earthworm itself helps hold
[SPEAKER_02]: soil particles together this is really an
early function of organic matter as it
[SPEAKER_02]: goes through its through its cycles of
breakdown this fresh material really
[SPEAKER_02]: favors what I call bacterial populations
they really take off on this this carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: energy and we've seen of course nitrogen
immobilization at where nitrogen is made
[SPEAKER_02]: unavailable to plants because the
competition by these bacteria is so great
[SPEAKER_02]: for the nitrogen that the plants can can
be plants can suffer so this is just a one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the properties of fresh material on the
other hand composts and here I mean kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of an extreme sense compost everything
from piled up leaves bio salads eyeless
[SPEAKER_02]: biochar municipal stockpiles these sort of
long-term you know produced compost that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be trucked and brought in what we
see here are typically more stable
[SPEAKER_02]: composts that more stable material than
the fresh material and what's happened is
[SPEAKER_02]: the the comp this composting has taken
place in a pile when we had the fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: material in contrast the composting so to
speak is taking place out in the field in
[SPEAKER_02]: situ right in the right in all these
little micro places in the field when we
[SPEAKER_02]: produce a compost of course a lot of those
these early processes nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: immobilization for example is taking place
in the pile which of course we can manage
[SPEAKER_02]: to produce a net final product compost but
the idea is we're we're producing
[SPEAKER_02]: something where these these early
processes have already taken place so
[SPEAKER_02]: these then these the products that we put
on the the added compost then is more
[SPEAKER_02]: stable which is what we get ultimately
from the the breakdown of the fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: material that ultimately becomes more
stable but here we're we're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: short-circuiting that by making by doing
it in a pile but also the last sentence
[SPEAKER_02]: here under composts we can also
concentrate nitrogen and phosphate in the
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and come up with actually a quite
rich material so we have to be aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: that as well okay so we see that these
biological processes then that we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil are going to be affected by the
the type of organic matter so how much
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel this living fresh material is in is
in the the source organic matter and how
[SPEAKER_02]: much is already in a stable or passive
condition which isn't necessarily food for
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms and it's more of an inert
loosening compound and of course in our
[SPEAKER_02]: soil we have existing soil organisms that
we can that will be affected by this
[SPEAKER_02]: material that we add that we give to them
in our management and of course we can
[SPEAKER_02]: affect that and the way we affect that is
with management is what we'll be talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about but this they these these two these
two actors here interact through moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature how we mix them together or
for example tillage the fertility level
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly nitrogen can affect how fast
these things turn over etc so let's get
[SPEAKER_02]: right to that so here it is in a nutshell
different plants and plant to breed
[SPEAKER_02]: composition is going to affect our soil
biology and this is where we need to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of thinking and learning about new new
varieties new for example in the cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop arena what I wanted to say is that
I'm sure you're all aware now of these
[SPEAKER_02]: crucifers these mustards that can have
compounds associated with them that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: use to our advantage to control organisms
in the soil we've seen that any number of
[SPEAKER_02]: times now in potatoes even in strawberries
that we can kind of manage our and choose
[SPEAKER_02]: a cover crop then that has a has a
byproduct of its breakdown that can affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil biology so that that's a kind of
an example of how we can modify the biotic
[SPEAKER_02]: community to suppress a disease but at the
same time when we build the soil with a
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop we're also keeping in mind that
we're making a by making a healthier plant
[SPEAKER_02]: we can sometimes simply outgrow a low
level on a low level of disease organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil and the way this is done is
that the plant itself can produce
[SPEAKER_02]: defensive compounds that stress pests or
the plants can enhance beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms so it's not just what we do the
plant itself is is acting to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and I'd like to go through that a
little here so the I think we all know
[SPEAKER_02]: that the plant root root modifies the rise
of sphere environment so the way I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about it is not unlike a a tree
growing out in a in a field that as it
[SPEAKER_02]: holds nutrients out of the ground it grows
leaves and then drops those leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately under that same soil so it's
enough it the plant in fact does very
[SPEAKER_02]: overtly modify its environment its soil
environment by pulling nutrients out
[SPEAKER_02]: turning them into leaves dropping the
leaves as those leaves break down
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds are released that help the plant
ostensibly continue to survive in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way now the root does the same thing
underground so the root is producing these
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves to if you will feather its own bed
by sloughing off cells around the root tip
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see that in the photo at the
bottom left in fact some estimates are
[SPEAKER_02]: suggest that even even up to 50 percent of
plant photosynthate is used in underground
[SPEAKER_02]: to not only grow roots and the dry matter
of the roots but that the root is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: giving these cells if you will this energy
to the environment in the rises fear just
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's giving leaves in the fall to the
soil above ground so the root tip loses
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these cells of these epithelial
cells as it moves through the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: then as these cells die they break open
and release release their contents into
[SPEAKER_02]: the rises fear these cells can become food
directly or they can simply dissolve on
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients in the rises fear zone and make
them available to the succeeding cells
[SPEAKER_02]: living cells in the root tip these cells
can release compounds that are
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonistic to disease organisms in the
vicinity this is a very direct effect but
[SPEAKER_02]: the these these cells and the and the
plant is really working against in its own
[SPEAKER_01]: in its own best interest and the reason
for this is is that the this root tip is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of the pilot going through the going
through the soil it doesn't take up much
[SPEAKER_02]: water or nutrients where that happens is
further up the root so where I show the
[SPEAKER_02]: root section and the root here on the top
part of the slide I'm actually suggesting
[SPEAKER_02]: that we kind of put this all together into
one picture and imagine that behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: root tip then as the root tips passing
into the soil the section behind that is
[SPEAKER_02]: where the these root hairs developed these
root hairs are single single cells that
[SPEAKER_02]: are very effective at uptaking water
nutrients and remember this the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment they're growing into has been
affected already by these sloughing off
[SPEAKER_02]: cells of the root tip of course these root
hairs are what get infected by rise by
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizobia bacteria in nitrogen fixation in
a lot of legumes also these root hairs
[SPEAKER_02]: entwine with fungal mycelium which is very
important for increased capture and again
[SPEAKER_02]: increased surface area for capture of
nutrients and water ultimately these root
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs will burst and release their release
compounds into the soil again dissolving
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolving the soils release nutrients
releasing compounds that again affect
[SPEAKER_02]: antagonists in the soil and provide an
environment favorable to the next root
[SPEAKER_02]: hair that moves into that that zone okay
so I wanted to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: just very broad sense here a lot of
interest in these different fields these
[SPEAKER_02]: days of a bacterially dominated system and
fungally fungal dominated system and this
[SPEAKER_02]: is very broad sense but it's I think it's
a useful strategy to kind of keep these
[SPEAKER_02]: keep some of these ideas in mind so we
said before that the bacteria are very
[SPEAKER_02]: fast-acting their population changes very
quickly the they're at the the root of the
[SPEAKER_02]: way we manage most annual field crops
we're counting on these bacteria what we
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're doing then is using the last
year's and previous year's organic
[SPEAKER_02]: material and mineralizing that into often
plant available materials and tillage
[SPEAKER_02]: promotes that because it stirs the soil
and provides fresh fresh opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria to meet fresh organic matter so
the bacteria don't move very far but when
[SPEAKER_02]: we till we of course add air and oxygen
but we also provide new opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: the for the bacteria and the result of
this is we get as these processes continue
[SPEAKER_02]: we get somewhat stable humic carbon
compounds that are somewhat recalcitrant
[SPEAKER_02]: and can build up into our long-term total
organic matter accumulation in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: but we see more of that in a more fungally
dominated system simply because when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: stirring we always provide yet another
chance to take this this long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: material and have something get at it so
in a fungally dominated system now we've
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of moved past this these early stages
of breakdown and the fungus I see them as
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat slower I don't mean that directly
but they're more if you will more
[SPEAKER_02]: deliberate and these systems in their
approach to using the nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_02]: there they take a little bit longer to
associate there are they're not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: these organisms don't necessarily just
float around in the soil they there while
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in the soil they're looking for a
relationship to a plant to a plant or to
[SPEAKER_02]: the material where the bacteria are just
really more opportunists we talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: how these then as these funguses develop
these relationships that they produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: wide network of mycelia that can increase
not only uptake of water nutrients for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant but also protect the plant against
outside attack by by disease organisms and
[SPEAKER_02]: since these these associations are more
complex they develop a little more slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: and they require not so much of this
favoritism towards the bacterial and the
[SPEAKER_02]: rapid the rapid turnover but in
undisturbed or permaculture environments
[SPEAKER_02]: or what we might see in a more of a very
situation there's time for these these
[SPEAKER_02]: infections and long-term associations to
develop and because of that then we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: chance for more complex carbon
sequestration in the more complex
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds what we would call humification
then and we can produce compounds that
[SPEAKER_02]: really sequester carbon over the long term
and help our soil with these with the with
[SPEAKER_02]: the processes that are more associated
with this what we call last week the very
[SPEAKER_02]: dead stable organic compounds right so
kind of a fun little slide I made here I
[SPEAKER_02]: show some people collecting leaves into a
leaf pile in the this last fall and across
[SPEAKER_02]: the top they simply pile them up and don't
stir them and at the end of at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: a year the next fall we see that the the
pile is about two-thirds as high as it was
[SPEAKER_02]: the year before not many of the leaves
broken down they've the weight of snow and
[SPEAKER_02]: rain is is kind of compressed some of the
air out of it but we haven't had a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of a lot of breakdown and so my co2
evolution out the top of these these boxes
[SPEAKER_02]: is smaller at the bottom we show a leaf
pile the same leaf pile being collected
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're doing a lot of stirring so we're
gonna turn our compost pile provide
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities to move bacteria into zones
of fresh material to attack and break down
[SPEAKER_02]: and etc and we seal because of that then
we're gonna gonna have a lot more carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: dioxide release so as we're gonna increase
our respiration through this through this
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity of the bacteria and as we
release carbon dioxide we move through the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil food web to if you will more complex
carbon compounds the simple ones being
[SPEAKER_01]: used up by the bacteria and of course I
think we all know the the model of the
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon cycle but I put this up because I
really see the it as being a balancing act
[SPEAKER_02]: between the the top arrow the top orange
arrow and the bottom orange arrow so on
[SPEAKER_02]: the one hand we're composing we're taking
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_02]: composing carbon into into sugars
cellulose and starch and on the other hand
[SPEAKER_02]: we're decomposing through the respiration
of soil microbes decomposing this organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter back to carbon dioxide and it's
this spinning this the rapid spinning of
[SPEAKER_02]: this as I was saying is the is what's
favored by the bacteria and when these
[SPEAKER_02]: when these cellulose and starch compounds
are can be more complex or or just
[SPEAKER_02]: different we're going to affect the soil
microbes then that would that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: able or want to rapidly decompose them so
I just I kind of like this this sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: concept to think about composing and
decomposing and what we're the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy that we're going to have to
approach and of course when we add manures
[SPEAKER_02]: or composts on the upper right we kind of
short-circuit the plant that had been done
[SPEAKER_02]: elsewhere but then we can directly affect
the this carbon cellulose starch whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to call this this complex material
that are then microbes are going to act on
[SPEAKER_02]: okay the here we go again with the soil
food web on the right I'm showing some
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi colonizing this plant rises fear in
a more just undisturbed environment just
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to use this slide to kind of
introduce this idea again of we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: living and dying soil organisms so there's
a there's really a web of life going on it
[SPEAKER_02]: quite rapidly in our soil that we're going
to want to affect with our management but
[SPEAKER_02]: first I'm going to take just a few minutes
to kind of say how we're going to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the processes that themselves in the soil
so that we can apply management to those
[SPEAKER_02]: processes so these right as these
organisms cycle they're basically breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: down organic debris and modifying it and
then one by one I want to step through
[SPEAKER_02]: these other ideas in this Cornell soil
health test we we're going to look at how
[SPEAKER_02]: these organisms create and release glues
and and try to try to measure that and
[SPEAKER_02]: quantify it on the right I show a clump of
sod dug up and you can see the the nice
[SPEAKER_02]: soil structure that nice crumb structure
these soil particles are glued together
[SPEAKER_02]: not only by the roots themselves of the
plants and the what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: these exudates from the roots but also the
organisms a rapid turnover of organisms in
[SPEAKER_02]: that zone helping to glue these these
particles together another thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider when we when we grow a if we call
this a cover crop or grow a crop we're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually inserting organic matter into the
ground when this plant dies right where
[SPEAKER_02]: right where you see the roots now as
opposed to tillage where we would kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: our tillage of let's say a compost applied
to the surface where we accomplish
[SPEAKER_02]: something very different we would mix we
would mix the soil from the surface in
[SPEAKER_02]: very heavy-handedly as opposed to growing
it in in place so that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously affect our our net result and
this is something we have to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: as we go forward with decisions on how we
want to affect our soil and at the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: right here I show just a kind of a
contrast in what soil looks like when we
[SPEAKER_02]: tested under the the soil health test on
the left that that soil tested right in
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium to medium low range instability
and the same soil under different
[SPEAKER_02]: management of no tillage we see that the
soil is holding these crumbs are holding
[SPEAKER_02]: up better to the action of the raindrops
right so this these soil organisms in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil can mineralize nutrients by breaking
down mineralization refers to taking
[SPEAKER_02]: organic material and and removing the
literally the nutrients and minerals in it
[SPEAKER_02]: back into plant available forms plants
tend to take up inorganic substances and
[SPEAKER_02]: combine them into organic forms so here we
want to go the other way and mineralize so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of the the opposite of what a
plant does we want to break that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: down into ideally nutrients for our plants
and we're gonna look at that we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: this with the potentially mineralizable
nitrogen test in a soil health test we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the rate of of breakdown of
organic materials to release ammonium
[SPEAKER_02]: we've mentioned before that these soil
organisms can protect or in fact crop
[SPEAKER_02]: plants based on what organisms are there
and how we manage for or against them we
[SPEAKER_02]: can use that to our advantage to protect
our our target plant and again this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw this last week this is the soil bio
assay test that we use in the soil health
[SPEAKER_02]: test this is actually a greenhouse test
where we plant you see replicate samples
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the on the upper left of a sample
of a soil sample where we put it one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these green beans into each tube and grown
it out in the greenhouse this is a this
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of green bean is called high style
and it's well known to researchers
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly in plant pathology because
it's sensitive to a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases a lot of growers or growers
typically don't buy this variety anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is so sensitive but we can use
that to our advantage to kind of see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in the soil and how our management
has affected these some of these less
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable players like pythium and
fusarium in particular and then another
[SPEAKER_01]: test in the Cornell soil health health
test we talked about last week was this
[SPEAKER_02]: active carbon and here's where we're
looking at the food value if you will or
[SPEAKER_02]: the energy literally the energy value of
the carbon in our soil this is the what I
[SPEAKER_02]: would call the kindling of the soil
organic matter this is the easily
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible easily oxidizable easily
available the sugars the cupcakes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil organic matter this is bacteria would
act very quickly on this sort of material
[SPEAKER_02]: but a we can measure this and say a high
level of this would then suggest a high
[SPEAKER_02]: level of activity in our soil so we can
use this information toward as we approach
[SPEAKER_02]: our management and we talked last week
it's mentioned it again we talked last
[SPEAKER_02]: week on about how this purple potassium
permanganate also can break down not
[SPEAKER_02]: unlike the organisms can break down and
burn this soil organic matter and so the
[SPEAKER_02]: more purple that's used up in the course
of this test it's a 10 minute shaking the
[SPEAKER_02]: more purple color that's used up the more
available organic matter was in the sample
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's it's kind of a again it's a we're
testing that flare up we're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: that kindling potential of the of the soil
organic matter right and here's the slide
[SPEAKER_02]: that we talked about a little bit last
week about the these long-term humic
[SPEAKER_02]: materials and how important they are and
literally these are the those persistent
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that we really talk about when
we say about building soil organic matter
[SPEAKER_02]: the other material it's just a matter of
time there's this fresh material won't be
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh for long it's always on its way to
being converted into something else as as
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms transform it but these compounds
are kind of the end of the line these are
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that as I say when we're building
or sequestering carbon over time these are
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones we're concerned with or that
we're talking about and that I had said we
[SPEAKER_02]: see more likely to develop in these
permaculture environments not just because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the the action of this a little more
fungal domination but also because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of stirring and why these are so
important directly is that these these
[SPEAKER_02]: humic substance really loosen the soil
they're very light and spongy they hold a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of water they soften clay soils and
they also hold chemical nutrients based on
[SPEAKER_02]: their charge their negative charge
[SPEAKER_01]: oops sorry I went the wrong way on that
one slide malfunction sorry about that
[SPEAKER_02]: here we go so back to our the slide we saw
before where we add organic matter again
[SPEAKER_02]: these red boxes are all the different
tests in the analyses in the Cornell soil
[SPEAKER_02]: health test looking at these different
soil processes but again I have to stress
[SPEAKER_02]: when we think of we want to we want to
understand all this but now we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about okay different organic matters
organic matter sources and qualities are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to affect these differentially so it
takes we have to use the same sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking and logic if you will on how
these how these processes are affected
[SPEAKER_02]: through the through their interaction of
the different realms of other actual
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities now how could we use that to our
advantage into what we want out of the the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil that we're working with going to
mention this is a Cornell soil health test
[SPEAKER_02]: suite of measured indicators on the left
and on the right of the soil processes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: here it is the soil health report again
the the indicators the value where the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue arrow is so these are the the lab or
field return values we rate remember we
[SPEAKER_02]: rate the these values with our database
the lower 30 percent of scores in the
[SPEAKER_02]: database are scored red and that's useful
for developing what we call constraints on
[SPEAKER_02]: the far right so if a if a value comes
back in the lower 30 percent for the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: texture for its soil texture then we would
say yes this these these functions are are
[SPEAKER_02]: below certainly below an optimum or room
for improvement and so this is where we
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of start to put together these these
different processes in the soil that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can then approach with our management to
kind of get at several of these at once as
[SPEAKER_02]: I said before create these these
synergistic opportunities for for knocking
[SPEAKER_02]: out multiple multiple issues at once
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have to mention the the website here
a lot of this material that we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: is on our website in the training manual
very useful document available as a free
[SPEAKER_02]: download from the website also there's all
sorts of information on sample sampling
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery of samples to our lab just
strategies in general and in the manual
[SPEAKER_02]: not only does it talk about part one the
soil test itself but what we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: move into now this the soil management
guidelines so kind of a starting place for
[SPEAKER_01]: using the information to go forward
[SPEAKER_01]: right so last week really we talked about
the soil processes the soil health test
[SPEAKER_02]: indicators at the bottom we spent a lot of
time on that I introduced this this idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can use this uses information in
the test report then towards our soil
[SPEAKER_02]: management but again to use this holistic
strategy we have to understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: processes find out which processes are
impaired then tweak our management to
[SPEAKER_00]: address them
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back to our soil health report from
before so this is a arrive at this was a
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberry field that had excuse me right
batch on it for two years three years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: and then strawberries were planted and
grown for two years it's a sandy loam soil
[SPEAKER_02]: so the first thing we're going to want to
do to use this holistic strategy is to
[SPEAKER_02]: test the soil and get the information on
what functions in the soil are good bad
[SPEAKER_02]: and indifferent and from this then we can
learn a lot for example we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregate stability the first physical
indicator you see that it comes back at a
[SPEAKER_02]: ninety five percent rating it's in the
green so we've got a really nice soil
[SPEAKER_02]: structure according to the test yet as we
move down the down the list we see that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's surface hardness and subsurface
hardness so we've got some compaction in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil which we'll want to take into
account as we move forward and down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: biological realm we see we've got a disk a
decent amount of total organic matter two
[SPEAKER_02]: point eight percent for a sandy loam
that's not bad but our active carbon our
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh organic material and our the the
rate of mineralization of nitrogen so this
[SPEAKER_02]: this breakdown of organic material into
available nutrients and fresh material
[SPEAKER_02]: that rate is also slow looks like our soil
chemistry is pretty good our pH kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of at the bottom end of where we'd
want it but P and K look good
[SPEAKER_02]: micronutrients look good too we've got an
overall score soil health score of fifty
[SPEAKER_02]: eight nine call that sixty in the medium
range kind of useful for just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking in the long term several years
later we will try it we'll try some
[SPEAKER_02]: different management on this field and
several years later we'll sample again and
[SPEAKER_02]: see how we've affected things so we've
talked about the first step step two what
[SPEAKER_02]: might we do our management options this is
kind of a brainstorming strategy here
[SPEAKER_02]: we're kind of say well it's certainly we'd
want to identify this hard layer find out
[SPEAKER_02]: just what's causing it where it is exactly
what are we going to do about it what
[SPEAKER_02]: might we do about it i list here that we
might we might plow it up we might maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: use a deep ripper we might go with a cover
crop then to address the soil biology
[SPEAKER_02]: while we're thinking about plowing and
ripping and and perhaps growing a cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop we want to maybe feed the soil some
heavy debris if we could get some if
[SPEAKER_02]: that's possible that debris could feed the
soil particularly if it's got rich
[SPEAKER_02]: biological material that would start to
spin our soil food web and perhaps address
[SPEAKER_02]: our active carbon if we use a nitrogen
rich material again this is a as a compost
[SPEAKER_02]: as we feed the soil directly if we had
something that had nitrogen first fair
[SPEAKER_02]: supply of nitrogen in the organic form
that would help build our population of
[SPEAKER_02]: mineralizable on nitrogen critters and
increase that that rate we may in our
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop we would want probably a rich
root residual like we saw in the sod photo
[SPEAKER_02]: a few slides ago where we can maybe
without even plowing we could move this
[SPEAKER_02]: rich organic material maybe it may be even
rich with or with nitrogen right into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil profile without plowing or bringing
anything in and that would be for example
[SPEAKER_02]: growing a clover or a vetch or an alfalfa
you may want to mix the disease rating
[SPEAKER_02]: here looks pretty good however there I
mentioned these options with these new
[SPEAKER_02]: crucifers a lot of different options out
there for crops to use as cover crops and
[SPEAKER_02]: nurse crops to to build the soil but again
we want to we want to have that in mind
[SPEAKER_02]: just because this test tells us we're in
good shape with with root health it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't mean we might not want to get
something mixed into our our rotation here
[SPEAKER_02]: that provides some suppressive capacity
towards something we know that's out there
[SPEAKER_02]: or have heard about in the vicinity so
then we're gonna move to step three and
[SPEAKER_02]: step four but before we do we want to
think about what we're trying to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: soil management it's it's an ever more
complex world there's so much information
[SPEAKER_02]: out there that we have to continue
learning modifying what we know asking
[SPEAKER_02]: questions seeing what people are doing all
over the world really certainly in our
[SPEAKER_02]: region to learn of these latest
technologies strategies so that we can be
[SPEAKER_02]: better not just better growers but as
consultants and educators better suppliers
[SPEAKER_02]: of information and sharing this
information so that we as a group can just
[SPEAKER_02]: all be more successful and of course as we
try to capture new markets or work with
[SPEAKER_02]: new varieties new cover crops that
requires us to really I use the word
[SPEAKER_02]: transition to be capable of applying this
new knowledge then incrementally into our
[SPEAKER_02]: own minds first then into our management
where we kind of realize that we the
[SPEAKER_02]: things we haven't been doing might behoove
us to to learn and to learn how to do
[SPEAKER_02]: never easy with agriculture as you know
there's a lot of risk associated with it
[SPEAKER_02]: and so we're we tend to want to be
risk-averse and these changes are risk
[SPEAKER_02]: because because there's a learning curve
so that's where the the consulting ag
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals and the grower will see more
and more of these liaisons being necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: yet at the same time that we're gonna see
probably less and less money for state and
[SPEAKER_02]: county support for this so we really need
to be thinking how can I get this
[SPEAKER_02]: information out as educators but also as
growers how can I get this information in
[SPEAKER_02]: from all these from all these different
sources okay and again this information
[SPEAKER_02]: all this information is we really have to
deal in a case by case field by field
[SPEAKER_02]: grower by grower basis so even when we
learn principles and strategies somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: at a conference yet at a particular
growers field we need to take from that
[SPEAKER_02]: then the principles and say ah can I use
that principles back in my locale and this
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually very exciting if you're an
educator because you you kind of get to go
[SPEAKER_02]: out into the world and and learn and then
apply that learning really without the
[SPEAKER_02]: risk that the grower has but the grower is
doing the same thing going out learning
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up with new questions for things to
try and more questions for the educator so
[SPEAKER_02]: this all this information going back and
forth it really requires considerable
[SPEAKER_02]: attention and thought and really if you
will creativity to be useful because
[SPEAKER_02]: things are changing and that change just
requires this kind of a deliberate process
[SPEAKER_02]: of of adapting to it right so in our soil
health manual we've got table five here on
[SPEAKER_02]: page 57 if everyone anyone has the manual
they kind of lists short term and
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term management strategies to deal
with for example limitations identified by
[SPEAKER_02]: the in the soil health report but I have
to mention these are just starting points
[SPEAKER_02]: but they do kind of get at this this idea
that we have a we have a generalized model
[SPEAKER_02]: that we start from so there's no I don't
want to say there's no answers here but
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no recommendations here it's it's
information that we again apply into our
[SPEAKER_02]: model and go forward with more specifics
that are germane to us but use this just
[SPEAKER_02]: as a more of a reference starting place so
I'd like to use this the first circled
[SPEAKER_02]: physical concern there this low aggregate
stability that look to talk in the short
[SPEAKER_02]: term how a manager might address that if
that was the case we note here that we
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about fresh organic materials
shallow rooted cover crops we saw the
[SPEAKER_02]: picture of that grass sod some slides ago
showing that how we could build soil
[SPEAKER_02]: structure with that of course a rotation
crop as well could can provide that when
[SPEAKER_02]: we had fresh manure in our green clippings
it's the surface of the soil of course
[SPEAKER_02]: where these these materials will be
rapidly attacked there's a lot of fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon there a lot of sugar so to speak
for the soil bacteria some rapid order
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna turn turnover spin that soil
food web help glue our soil back together
[SPEAKER_02]: and in the longer term we're gonna we're
gonna want to be thinking about well how
[SPEAKER_02]: did I get into this position in the first
place it may be that we want to look at a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of interest these days in reducing
tillage not not necessarily going to what
[SPEAKER_02]: we call no till but there's a new term out
there called low till where we just simply
[SPEAKER_02]: try to reduce the tillage intensity and
frequency look for opportunities to really
[SPEAKER_02]: think can we focus the tillage right in a
zone rather than across the whole soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface for example we might want to think
about a surface mulch certainly in a in a
[SPEAKER_02]: very situation we're often dealing with
surface mulches that can protect the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and provide a constant source of material
that we can kind of maybe disk in or stir
[SPEAKER_02]: in a little bit once in a while to keep
our our soil bacteria cycling and
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting that soil structure
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so in a again on a broad sense when
we talk about the soil health report
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy gone over this several times and
I do apologize but I think it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: to to keep mentioning this we're gonna
identify areas in the soil that need
[SPEAKER_02]: attention because they have we're
determining that the processes are are
[SPEAKER_02]: constrained so now we want to combine this
information with the growers needs skills
[SPEAKER_02]: and available resources to come up with a
strategy to deal with them and I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: here the the four really our four broad
sense options in management there anything
[SPEAKER_02]: we might do the soil really pretty much
falls into one or a combination of these
[SPEAKER_02]: groups so we can change the the crop that
we grow and what that leaves behind how
[SPEAKER_02]: that if that organic matter affects the
soil also the production strategy how we
[SPEAKER_02]: manage the soil to grow that crop affects
the soil by again of changing varieties or
[SPEAKER_02]: to the longer season shorter seasons for
example we can open windows for cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops to be inserted into these windows so
hybrid choice becoming very important in
[SPEAKER_02]: crop rotation a lot of a lot of
documentation of what these different
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids can do to provide even as we
mentioned before certain chemicals in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that that we might want as a if you
will as a byproduct to affect our soil
[SPEAKER_02]: soil environment and of course cover crops
themselves what a what an easy thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: say you know we need to grow a cover crop
but that that only that only puts the book
[SPEAKER_02]: on the table it still needs to be opened
and read and this is where it's it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: brave new world a lot of information out
there we just need to really be on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: what all these options are and we'll go
through that in a moment organic and
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical amendments we when we manage the
soil certainly I mentioned a couple times
[SPEAKER_02]: we can bring material from other places in
and apply to our soil surface either as
[SPEAKER_02]: organic or chemical and work that in or or
leave it there and of course we typically
[SPEAKER_02]: work it in with tillage and soil stirring
and so we always have options to manage
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil that way so we'll go through
those one by one the crop rotation
[SPEAKER_02]: suppressing disease smothering weeds all
these again kind of broad sense caveats of
[SPEAKER_02]: really an agronomic approach the when we
rotate crops we can again put different
[SPEAKER_02]: material there or not there at different
times to affect our soil biology different
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops same idea but there's
different windows for four different cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops and again they're going to have
different qualities the different cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops not only when they're because
because of when they're grown but what
[SPEAKER_02]: they bring what they bring to our the
organic table the palette organic and
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical amendments my gosh manure and
compost so easy to list them but the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity of manure and compost and green
manure is how we might use these again
[SPEAKER_02]: these it's very easy to list these but
there's a lot of information behind each
[SPEAKER_02]: of these that we'll discuss in a moment
but we have to be aware that it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: take creative thought and movement into
the page beyond this page to make our best
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions and of course I mentioned crop
residues themselves biochar then more
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional fertilizers pesticides
herbicides that we can also add to the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil to manage it and of course tillage
this I mentioned the low till and no till
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage can break up or prevent compaction
and there's lots of new equipment out
[SPEAKER_02]: there it allows us I call it innovations
in disturbance different ways we can stir
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil different shapes of shank
everything from different shapes of shanks
[SPEAKER_02]: colters etc that can be very useful for us
[SPEAKER_02]: okay I show here on the right crop
rotation on organic farms that's a fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: recent publication available through the
SARE website SARE.org for a very low price
[SPEAKER_02]: also available free as an online download
this looks like it's for organic farms and
[SPEAKER_02]: it is but that's not to say that there's
not principles in here that are useful for
[SPEAKER_02]: any grower you know as you know organic
growers must be very cognizant of crop
[SPEAKER_02]: rotations to protect their or to right
affect their soil biological populations
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't have the literally the
luxury of coming in with a with a very
[SPEAKER_02]: specific chemical that had that has very
specific chemicals that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: developed for us by chemical companies to
to kill or or manage a very specific pests
[SPEAKER_02]: so the the organic perspective here is
very useful towards as we strategize
[SPEAKER_02]: towards understanding of how we can affect
our our soil biology right so the again
[SPEAKER_02]: the different crops suppress or break
disease cycles there's by growing crops
[SPEAKER_02]: that take more or less time we open up
windows we can grow a couple crop for
[SPEAKER_02]: example to some other weeds ideal crop
rotations best usually utilize our our
[SPEAKER_02]: land equipment and labor resources allow
us to grow crops that people are clamoring
[SPEAKER_02]: for and paying money for and of course
rotation with side I had to mention this
[SPEAKER_02]: in a crop when we talk about crop rotation
it's important to consider taking a field
[SPEAKER_02]: not out of production but putting a part
of a field into side for all the wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: things it can do to rebuild the soil very
dramatically and drastically wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk a little bit about cover crops again
wonderful book out there managing cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops profitably available for free to
download at the website below or very low
[SPEAKER_02]: cost and this gets at the cult the culture
and aspect and qualities of a whole suite
[SPEAKER_02]: of cover crops for the whole certainly for
the whole northeast and this this book
[SPEAKER_02]: actually goes further south and a bit into
the into the western state in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Midwestern states I talk about all the
different effects and culture of cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops but again different cover crops will
have different qualities more or less of
[SPEAKER_02]: them of some of these listed features here
so if we had a we had an issue of that we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to for example add nitrogen with a
cover crop obviously there's we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: choose in the legume family family but the
idea here is we want to we want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: really be wise and clever and choose well
but there's a lot to learn we can't it
[SPEAKER_02]: this isn't just an off-the-cuff decision
I'm going to plant a cover crop and now
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done until I plant it know that as I
say that that book needs to be opened and
[SPEAKER_02]: takes a lot of discussion a lot of
research a lot of questions to be asked
[SPEAKER_02]: and answered by the grower and the any
sort of consultant so that we can maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: even with a with with our cover crop not
only address some of the things we see
[SPEAKER_02]: here but do more than that simultaneously
and again some cover crops do several of
[SPEAKER_02]: these singularly circled factors at once
right there's even a online cover crop
[SPEAKER_02]: decision tool I've got the website down at
the bottom this was developed by Thomas
[SPEAKER_02]: Bjorkman a Cornell researcher up at Geneva
where you can actually type in a
[SPEAKER_02]: management goal so it is he says the
reason you need a cover crop so from that
[SPEAKER_02]: last slide if we wanted to enhance one of
those particular features if our we're
[SPEAKER_02]: really looking to affect one particular
aspect of our soil very powerfully we
[SPEAKER_02]: could type that in here and then the crop
the decision tool would also ask us well
[SPEAKER_02]: when is your window how and how long is it
open and then it would give you different
[SPEAKER_02]: options of cover crops that fit fit that
need but again I'm going to go over all
[SPEAKER_02]: four of these bullets here note that each
option tested in such a strategy is always
[SPEAKER_02]: an iteration towards a final decision I
had to read that it's this idea that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to kind of go through it in our mind
and say does this work or how well does it
[SPEAKER_02]: work because we can always modify that a
little bit towards what we need and that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to keep that in mind a lot lots of
success through sharing success stories
[SPEAKER_02]: when we see a grower with a particular
situation in an area that kind of comes up
[SPEAKER_02]: with a cover crop crop combination that
has luck with that we hear about it at a
[SPEAKER_02]: field day for example or we see something
we can think ah now how can I modify that
[SPEAKER_02]: or use that for myself as a starting point
it's very seen a lot of great we heard a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of great success stories built out of
success stories growers often start small
[SPEAKER_02]: and we recommend this using strip trials
or you know half of a field managed one
[SPEAKER_02]: way or another way to kind of learn on
their farm what works or what they find
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't won't work for them also as
we enter into new worlds of cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: and different rotations we can also
introduce new pests and problems that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have before because we weren't
using these strategies so again we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be vigilant and ready to learn whatever is
necessary to move forward right now I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk a little bit more about this
managing of organic matter again I put a
[SPEAKER_02]: book by Harold Van Ness and Fred Magdoff
in the upper left corner this building
[SPEAKER_02]: soil for better crops available free
online very low cost if you want to own
[SPEAKER_02]: the book itself and what this book talks
about a great in great length is how to
[SPEAKER_02]: balance this idea of we want to decompose
organic matter to release nutrients we
[SPEAKER_02]: want the organic matter to break down to
as I've mentioned before glue our
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregates together we want to feed the
important soil biology but at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time we also want organic matter to
accumulate for all the important reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want organic matter in our soil to
to store water to retain nutrients to
[SPEAKER_02]: loosen the soil the carbon storage so the
really the only way to to be successful at
[SPEAKER_02]: this is to literally keep adding organic
matter because we as we decompose it we we
[SPEAKER_02]: have less and we can only accumulate it by
growing or adding more so we we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of tip this scale the other way so
we're kind of accumulating on a net basis
[SPEAKER_02]: or should say a gross basis even though at
times we need to decompose some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter so again it we're gonna
have to feed the soil with different
[SPEAKER_02]: materials and regularly and the more
diverse organic matter we can add the more
[SPEAKER_02]: the broader a base of organic activity we
have in the field and again I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: compost cover crops these crop revenues
adding leaves biochar when we when we add
[SPEAKER_02]: these different materials or grow these
different materials remember that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to accumulate a different kind then
of soil food web response to this
[SPEAKER_02]: different food source and that's really
what ultimately what we're managing for
[SPEAKER_02]: here's this slide all organic matter is
not created equal I've talked about this
[SPEAKER_02]: any number of times now but if we look at
this pyramid when we add a green matter or
[SPEAKER_02]: green manure as a cover crop we're adding
these sugars these these lighter less
[SPEAKER_02]: complex compounds that the bacteria are
very hungry for when we had composts or
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're dealing with composts we've
moved further down the pyramid already in
[SPEAKER_02]: the compost pile into these more complex
longer lasting materials and again the
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of organic matter are
going to affect the bullets you see at the
[SPEAKER_02]: right some of them will affect soil
aggregation particularly the green matter
[SPEAKER_02]: but different green matter will have
different effect on the soil itself we've
[SPEAKER_02]: all heard of for example buckwheat having
a particularly profound effect on soil
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregation on a very short time so we
again we need to keep that in mind it's
[SPEAKER_02]: they're easy again easy to list as bullet
points but we need to think about what
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly will do that to be to affect our
management
[SPEAKER_02]: right and also this is also something we
see in Harold Vanessa's book more is not
[SPEAKER_02]: always better so we have to be careful
particularly when we apply compost and
[SPEAKER_02]: manure on the surface of the soil it's
very easy to over apply and cause leaching
[SPEAKER_02]: and denitrification concerns in vegetables
in particular we don't want too much vigor
[SPEAKER_02]: from too high supply of nitrogen or or
other compounds or other nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil also over application of compost
might keep the soil too wet all important
[SPEAKER_02]: considerations to always work within if I
can move down to the last bullet point to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of start from what I'm calling an
industry standard we don't want to go
[SPEAKER_02]: overboard with these application
strategies we want to kind of start from a
[SPEAKER_02]: safe place and then modify from there as
our crops and our field and our our
[SPEAKER_02]: material requires and keeping in mind also
that especially I give this wine example
[SPEAKER_02]: here how some crops grapes grown for wine
actually we don't want this great vigor
[SPEAKER_02]: and we want to be actually be very careful
of what we're adding just kind of a if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want over extreme example of really
thinking ahead towards what we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure that that is indeed what we
want oh right back to our stirring of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil again to speed up these bacterial
illogical processes the organic matter is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to mineralize faster when we stir it
and the way we do that stirring so often
[SPEAKER_02]: was with tillage this is a slide showing
tillage addiction so I'm going to go from
[SPEAKER_02]: the upper left clockwise around where we
till a soil we see being completely
[SPEAKER_02]: inverted this is a sod it's being plot
plowed a little wet kind of show the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a worst-case scenario here of of soil
tillage nonetheless we're always involved
[SPEAKER_02]: at kind of some aspect of this so after we
flip the soil over with this till it
[SPEAKER_02]: mobile tillage now we've got cloudy soil
that needs to be made into a seed bed or a
[SPEAKER_02]: planting bed then typically we come across
the field and pack it down firm it up but
[SPEAKER_02]: then we're set up for potential crusting
the soils unprotected it's bare this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a worst-case scenario but I show
this to make people realize that or not
[SPEAKER_02]: forget I should say the tillage is a very
powerful very powerful tool that we
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't shouldn't take lightly that when
we and when we apply tillage we're really
[SPEAKER_02]: really affecting a lot of a lot of soil
processes not just the physical things you
[SPEAKER_02]: see here but the organisms are going to be
literally tipped upside down and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to respond to that in a way that may
be useful to us or or maybe not so we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep that in mind we see a lot of
focused tillage through this this sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: ripper strategy instead of a last slide
that was a full full width mow word plow
[SPEAKER_02]: just flipping over the entire soil surface
this these rippers I think everyone's seen
[SPEAKER_02]: these have a rather narrow shank typically
an inch wide this is shown set up for row
[SPEAKER_02]: crop production however the idea is that
we focus the tillage really right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: vicinity of this rip shank we don't flip
the entire surface over and we end up
[SPEAKER_02]: really just kind of plowing in a in a
narrow zone here's kind of what that looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like then in the upper left we've got an
kind of an undisturbed surface for most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil surface but then our rip shank
can go at a variety of different depths
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever is necessary to break restricted
layers up and we're left with a if you
[SPEAKER_02]: will a no till environment between the
rips and a tilled environment where the
[SPEAKER_02]: rips are very handy in approaching a
certainly a bedded situation where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: we're almost forced to do this but you
keep in mind that by focusing the focusing
[SPEAKER_02]: the disturbance we can kind of get the
best of both worlds and allow us and this
[SPEAKER_02]: is of course a field crop example but
we've got then a hybrid system where we've
[SPEAKER_02]: plowed we're going to plant the seed and
have a small plant but then as the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: grows and explores new areas it'll
actually be growing between the rows into
[SPEAKER_02]: a virtually unplowed or no till
environment so we've got a plow a plow
[SPEAKER_02]: zone and an unplowed zone and so we can
take advantage of the season if it's wet
[SPEAKER_02]: or dry or periods of wet and dry the plant
has areas where the root is that where the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil will be drier or moisture because of
this hybrid scenario so i really like this
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of slide to show you how we when we
change our management a little bit if we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the bottom center's picture we see
on the right the conventional if it's hot
[SPEAKER_02]: and dry our entire soil surface is going
to dry out for example we're with a
[SPEAKER_02]: restricted width tillage where we focus
our tillage if we get a lot of hot dry
[SPEAKER_02]: weather we're going to have a little bit
more water storage underneath all the
[SPEAKER_02]: debris between those ripped areas
[SPEAKER_02]: right and i list here some of these these
tips for transitioning that's one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite words to reduce tillage crop
production the idea is is that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to transition to less tillage so
we're we're thinking about do i need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what i've always done is there a new
method out there or i've heard of this new
[SPEAKER_02]: method how do i transition my field into
using it and here's some of the some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ideas so first of all we saw
compaction is a question of soil being
[SPEAKER_02]: dense to alleviate alleviate that we want
to loosen the soil again this is with with
[SPEAKER_02]: the iron in the field as opposed to a
using plants to do it but we can focus our
[SPEAKER_02]: tillage to two specific zones in
particular for example a wheel track zone
[SPEAKER_02]: may be the only area compacted in our
field is where a particular piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment went well it would it might
behoove us to focus directly on that
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than attempting to loosen or till
till the entire field and that's where we
[SPEAKER_02]: can also when we when we put this in
concert with the green text i guess number
[SPEAKER_02]: four we can feed the soil food web with
our organic material and combine that with
[SPEAKER_02]: our tillage and say wait this is this is
how it can accomplish more than one or a
[SPEAKER_02]: second and third objective simultaneously
in my management strategy of course then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's longer and shorter term strategies
for that with the cover crops rotations
[SPEAKER_02]: adding organics reducing tillage we listed
those in the toolbox when we can build the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and reduce our tillage and and build
it with rebuild our soil structure the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil can become more resilient to weather
extremes and i have to mention at the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom that when the soil is in this if
you will healthier condition in better
[SPEAKER_02]: balance everything seems to work better
this this idea of applying reduced tillage
[SPEAKER_02]: to to huge effect positive effect is an
enhanced when the soil is in good
[SPEAKER_02]: condition here i just wanted to show how
there's a synergistic effect to our
[SPEAKER_02]: management so we see soil health on the
y-axis and years across the x if we apply
[SPEAKER_02]: if we modify our management with finding
windows for different cover crops or
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing our tillage individually if we
apply these managements we can increase
[SPEAKER_02]: our our soil health but if we can
creatively put them together and combine
[SPEAKER_02]: them with an overall holistic plan we tend
to see faster and greater overall response
[SPEAKER_02]: what we call an additive effect of putting
these positive management approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: together kind of a synopsis slide here
showing the soil health report on the left
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're going to talk about in just a
minute as we go through the final
[SPEAKER_02]: management stages of interpreting this but
we do want to remember that the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: health tool soil health report is a tool
in a whole program of developing solutions
[SPEAKER_02]: to farm field market issues what we're
talking about here is that we have this
[SPEAKER_02]: framework for guiding our soil management
using these pro using a process based
[SPEAKER_02]: approach but in the context of the the
growers needs and desires and limitations
[SPEAKER_02]: and i've mentioned this several times but
this idea of there's always forever on now
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be more and more information
available to people in the field in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of strategies other and technologies other
people are using and that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: require that we we stay abreast of this so
that we can do our best job to not not
[SPEAKER_02]: fall behind that the rapid pace of of soil
management these days also i had to put
[SPEAKER_02]: this in as a this idea to illustrate this
idea of creativity we really like this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a going from a closed i like going
from this idea of a closed a closed mind
[SPEAKER_02]: that says there's we can't that this won't
work here so we're dealing with some
[SPEAKER_02]: extension folks up in vermont they said
well we can't we can't put cover crops
[SPEAKER_02]: after a corn silage up here our growing
season is too short and some specialists
[SPEAKER_02]: up there said well wait a minute let's
let's work with some of the growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: see if we went to a for example a shorter
season variety opening up a window of time
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the season for a cover crop
they they tried it they went with a 10 day
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter corn variety for uh field corn for
uh field corn and allowed them to um
[SPEAKER_02]: actually be successful with establishing a
rye cover crop with these just just a few
[SPEAKER_02]: extra days gave them quite a quite a heads
up on the on using the tried and true
[SPEAKER_02]: older season varieties so it just goes i
just wanted to show with this that um
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes there's um with a little bit of
risk or creativity risk and creativity
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of put together and try something as
a little trial um we can come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's useful to perhaps a lot
of people okay so i'm running over here so
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm going to uh go quickly through these
last two steps step three and four of our
[SPEAKER_02]: uh soil health report here we said this
was a two-year strawberry field coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of right batch two years ago this grower
is willing to experiment with different
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops he's considering transitioning
to organic because the market value he
[SPEAKER_02]: does have a dairy farm nearby just a
little bit of background on who exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: this person or who specifically this
person is so step three we say we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply this the soil process information
that we have in front of us with the uh
[SPEAKER_02]: situational opportunities where is this
guy what's he up to what does he have at
[SPEAKER_02]: his disposal so we listed here step three
this grower does have access to a grain
[SPEAKER_02]: drill this this local dairy nearby has a
deep ripping machine for possible
[SPEAKER_02]: decompaction this dairyman will bring his
big tractor and this ripper to the field
[SPEAKER_02]: and and a person and will rip the this up
for and will agrees to rip this up for 100
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars per acre so this this is an 80
acre field so for 800 dollars um or to do
[SPEAKER_02]: half the field this growers that's dairy
farmers willing to come over and
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment with that the grower again is
interested in cover crops or attends a
[SPEAKER_01]: workshop go to step four oops huh what's
there one moment
[SPEAKER_02]: there and step four so putting all this
together sitting with the grower the
[SPEAKER_02]: growers come up with a management strategy
for this year in the spring he's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: plow the field up and seed a rye vetch
mustard mix and he's trying to get a sod
[SPEAKER_02]: forming cover crop there with the rye the
vetch to supply nitrogen as well as a deep
[SPEAKER_02]: taproot the must mustard for some disease
suppressive compounds he also wants to try
[SPEAKER_02]: a strip trial of uh rubeckia or and or
switchgrass you learn this in his cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop class these these crops have good
cover crop qualities and the organic
[SPEAKER_02]: debris from them is useful in maintenance
of soil organics for strawberries this
[SPEAKER_02]: growers proposing to then flail mow and
deep rip during 2012 leaving all whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: in any of these organic growth systems
here including a strip trial he's just
[SPEAKER_02]: going to mow that and leave it on the
field so everything's just going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: grown and left left in place he may even
consider a different cover crop if one of
[SPEAKER_02]: these doesn't pan out and then he'll
decide based on how the soil looks at as
[SPEAKER_02]: the season goes on in 2013 if he'll
continue this cover cropping or perhaps go
[SPEAKER_02]: to a cash crop like sweet corn so that's
the end of the presentation just listed
[SPEAKER_02]: here some of those ideas we've been over a
couple of times during this this talk how
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil health tests identifying these so
constrained soil process is kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning we're going to keep those in
mind as we think what might what might
[SPEAKER_02]: this grower do or what might i do to get
at to get at these constraints what can i
[SPEAKER_02]: try to see what will really work adapt
many sources of information ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: building the soil to increase this
resiliency the extreme weather we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to continue to see okay with that i'll say
thank you and open the floor to questions
[SPEAKER_03]: and i just would encourage anybody that's
been participating to use your chat box in
[SPEAKER_03]: the lower right hand corner and type in
any questions that you may have so that
[SPEAKER_03]: bob can respond
[SPEAKER_03]: uh glenn had a comment his comment was
resiliency to extremes interesting given
[SPEAKER_03]: increase in intense rains i don't know
whether you have any comments to that bob
[SPEAKER_02]: right well i i'd kind of mentioned this at
one point um any time right when the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: is degraded it's uh it's already down and
then when we get extreme weather it's then
[SPEAKER_02]: then it gets kicked so to speak um but
when it when we can build a soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly protect the surface um but that
surface can also be protected if you will
[SPEAKER_02]: internally by getting organic matter um to
break down in between these particles and
[SPEAKER_02]: help glue them together again building our
soil structure um in particular really uh
[SPEAKER_02]: really uh gives the that's the foundation
if you will the house they talk about soil
[SPEAKER_02]: structure being the house um of the for
the soil microbes to live within we can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of build that or as we build that
we're just making a more stable
[SPEAKER_02]: environment for whatever is thrown at us
be it heavy rains or drought from what
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen at least in this area this
winter it's been very different than what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're used to but i think we can get we
should get used to non-typical weather so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's said we're going to have to modify
our management so that non-typical weather
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't as hurtful or damaging as it as it
could be so that's going to take again
[SPEAKER_02]: that sort of creativity that kind of uh
hedging the bets with um with management
[SPEAKER_02]: to get at processes that are going to
leave us in a better better better um
[SPEAKER_02]: better position to weather pardon the pun
um the weather that comes i i do want to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention in your discussion you were
talking about compost and i think people
[SPEAKER_03]: equate compost with a lot of very positive
attributes and i will say that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things listed there was
municipal compost i would just encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: people to be a little careful with
municipal compost they they you should
[SPEAKER_03]: really ask for an analysis and a heavy
metal analysis of those kinds of products
[SPEAKER_03]: and even the heavy metal analysis can be a
little misinforming we had a composting
[SPEAKER_03]: facility in syracuse area and syracuse has
some industry in it it's not just a
[SPEAKER_03]: residential community where you'd expect
like things like copper in compost made
[SPEAKER_03]: from those materials but it had some light
industry in syracuse and they used lime at
[SPEAKER_03]: i think it was close to one third of the
dry matter weight of the material as let's
[SPEAKER_03]: say an adjuvant to help processes along to
reduce the pathogen level down and in the
[SPEAKER_03]: process it does tie up heavy metals and
when they did the testing to test what the
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy metal levels were they were not
really available at really super high ph's
[SPEAKER_03]: which this turned out to be and a
homeowner could be fooled and purchase or
[SPEAKER_03]: a grower could be fooled and purchased
material and thinking that it really
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't have any heavy metals in it
