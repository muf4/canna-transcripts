[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has the potential to change final
yield and affect and how we manage our
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural acres worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm going to speak to you about how
in the Soros lab we're looking to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: regions of the wheat genome that implement
or are implemented in affecting kernel
[SPEAKER_02]: weight and size and their potential for
being introduced into elite varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cereal crop yields can simply be
modeled as the spikes per area by the
[SPEAKER_02]: kernels per spike and by the weight per
kernel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And considering the economic importance of
yield there have been countless genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: associations looking into these different
yield components.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been less success in actually
identifying the causal variants and
[SPEAKER_02]: implementing them in elite varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is due to the fact that the
wheat genome is very large and hexaploid
[SPEAKER_02]: and also that yield itself is a
quantitative trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's controlled by many small effect
variants across the genome and even these
[SPEAKER_02]: three simplifications illustrated here are
quantitative traits themselves that are
[SPEAKER_02]: often negatively correlated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Considering this it's important when we're
studying yield to break it down into its
[SPEAKER_02]: individual components.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking specifically at kernel weight and
kernel morphology this is largely
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled by the grain filling
characteristics such as how long a variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of wheat is photosynthetically active in
the field as well as the physical
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters of the kernels themselves such
as their length and their width and those
[SPEAKER_02]: are both under independent genetic
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're developing a new wheat variety
the kernel weight and shape are important
[SPEAKER_02]: traits to consider because they both can
impact I can mention final yield but also
[SPEAKER_02]: flower yield which is both going to be a
bottom economic lines for a grower and a
[SPEAKER_02]: mill and selecting variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Returning though to the more elusive
characterization of the genes that
[SPEAKER_02]: underlie these traits the wheat community
has recently had some the release of new
[SPEAKER_02]: tools that are going to allow us to go
beyond QTL associations and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: pursue fine maps and cloning of those
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those include the release of a fully
annotated wheat reference sequence genome
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the prospects of gene editing
and tools like CRISPR we can pursue the
[SPEAKER_02]: fine mapping the positional cloning of
yield components.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wheat cap or coordinated agricultural
project aims to do just this it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: concerted effort across 15 land-grant
universities to identify genes that
[SPEAKER_02]: control different yield components and
then implement them into wheat breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell is a part of this effort and
specifically in the Soros lab we're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to identify genes that impact
kernel weight and kernel shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do this we're using a bi-parental
population across between the spring wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties W7984 or synthetic W7984 and
Opata M85 and those have formed mapping
[SPEAKER_02]: reference populations we have access to
double taploids as well as the large
[SPEAKER_02]: population of recombinant inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Previous work in the Soros lab indicated
to us that there were grain morphology
[SPEAKER_02]: traits on the group five chromosomes but
our challenge now is to zoom in on those
[SPEAKER_02]: and identify the positional the gene
architecture and physical positions of
[SPEAKER_02]: causal variants.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do this we have a two-pronged approach
we can first validate the QTL across
[SPEAKER_02]: environments and locations and gears using
the double taploids and then we can grain
[SPEAKER_02]: finer resolution and pursue fine mapping
by using heterogeneous inbred families.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are essentially near isogenic ions
that differ at the QTL we develop them
[SPEAKER_02]: from selecting recombinant inbred lines
that we're segregating for the QTL or our
[SPEAKER_02]: regions of interest and then have
continuously inbred them so they're
[SPEAKER_02]: largely fixed across the genome but have
either perennials allele at the QTL as a
[SPEAKER_02]: control for our purposes or they're
segregating which will allow us to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify key recombination events that are
associated with our positive trait of
[SPEAKER_02]: interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these plants are field grown we've
been working with the double taploids and
[SPEAKER_02]: the HIFs in the field since 2016 and
they're planted in head rows for the
[SPEAKER_02]: double taploids but we have to plant the
HIFs as individual space planted rows
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're segregating again and we
tagged them individually as you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: here so we can keep track of them for all
of our phenotyping and genotyping
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genotyping this is a largely or the
synthetic apada population is widely used
[SPEAKER_02]: in the wheat breeding community so we've
access to a lot of public resources for
[SPEAKER_02]: genotyping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I specifically have been developing cast
markers which are a fluorescent stamp
[SPEAKER_02]: marker for targeting more specific regions
associated with our QTL.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phenotyping which is cut off here is
all done post harvest and we harvest all
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants individually and take a
representative hundred kernel sample which
[SPEAKER_02]: is a proxy for a thousand kernel weight
and then we also take that same sample and
[SPEAKER_02]: scan it on a flatbed scanner and take the
kernel width and length parameters which
[SPEAKER_02]: is what you can't see written right there
and then all of our phenotype and genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: correlations I've been using our QTL.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point we've identified QTL on
chromosomes 2D, 5A, 5B, and 6D that are
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly associated with thousand
kernel weight and or the width and the
[SPEAKER_02]: length but I want to draw your attention
to chromosome 5A.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a 140 megabase pair stretch on
the long arm that is significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with thousand kernel weight and
kernel width.
[SPEAKER_02]: This region is more highly annotated than
what I'm showing you here but for today's
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes I just want to mention that it is
fully fixed across the double taploids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We either have the apada or the synthetic
alleles for all of these markers but
[SPEAKER_02]: within the HIFs it's segregating and
that's going to allow us to pursue the
[SPEAKER_02]: further fine mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our QTL then provides us with a LOD score
or logarithm of odds which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement of significance between a
genetic marker and a physical trait that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in dark blue we have the across this
140 megabase pair region the LOD score
[SPEAKER_02]: significance values 4,000 kernel weight
and in light blue that's going to be for
[SPEAKER_02]: the width measurements and consistently we
break our threshold significance level of
[SPEAKER_02]: 3.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I want to show you the parental
associations for these alleles and which
[SPEAKER_02]: parent's allele is the positive donor for
these traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that by breaking the double
tapoid population into two groups based on
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they carry the synthetic allele or
the apada allele across the 140 megabase
[SPEAKER_02]: pair region and looking specifically here
at the thousand kernel weight distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand kernel weight is on the x-axis
and we've broken the population into two
[SPEAKER_02]: groups with apada alleles across the locus
in pink or synthetic in blue and on
[SPEAKER_02]: average we see a 4.4% increase in thousand
kernel weight for double tapoid lines that
[SPEAKER_02]: carry the apada allele rather than the
synthetic and we see a similar story when
[SPEAKER_02]: we look at the width distributions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here width is on the x-axis and again
there's 3.75% increase in kernel width
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with double tapoid lines that
carry the apada allele rather than the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic at our locus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned previously that the kernel
length can also independently impact
[SPEAKER_02]: kernel weight and so here we see at our
locus there's little to no difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: kernel length for whether a double tapoid
plant carries either parent's allele which
[SPEAKER_02]: indicates to us we're pursuing a gene in
this region that controls thousand kernel
[SPEAKER_02]: weight most likely due to an increase in
kernel width.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our ultimate goal is to be introducing
these genes into varieties that farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: like to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing this simultaneously by back
crossing the genes as we continue to find
[SPEAKER_02]: map them into elite varieties grown by
domestic farmers as well as through the
[SPEAKER_02]: wheat caps collaboration with cement and
we'll continue to pursue the
[SPEAKER_02]: identification of candidate genes and then
further identify and validate the gene
[SPEAKER_02]: architecture through mutant populations
and then potentially gene editing if that
[SPEAKER_02]: suits our purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A challenge that I mentioned is that the
double tapoid population has limited
[SPEAKER_02]: resolution but if we return to our
methodologies and strategies I can develop
[SPEAKER_02]: cast primers that target recombination
events at our QTL taking place in the
[SPEAKER_02]: segregating HIF population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 200 HIF plants were harvested from
the field this summer and they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: genotyped and I'm in the process of
phenotyping those and those correlations
[SPEAKER_02]: will lay a strong foundation for the
continuous fine mapping of these traits
[SPEAKER_02]: and our field plantings this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that I'd like to say thank you to the
many advisors that I have on this research
[SPEAKER_02]: and would be happy to answer any
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the distributions of the kernel width
it appeared like, I think that's what it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, you appear to have this bimodal thing
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have an explanation for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there another gene segregating for some
reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we work with this population in the
field it's really diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different phenotypes and
I'm sure there is something that we aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: catching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also mentioned just how complex field is
and there's many different traits
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we grow fewer plants that we're more
confident in the region of the gene I hope
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can take further phenotypes that
might account for some of those effects
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not sure what trait is causing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's give Ellie another round
of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
