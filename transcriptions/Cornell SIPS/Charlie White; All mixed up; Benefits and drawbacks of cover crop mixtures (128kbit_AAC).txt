[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see everyone here for the
mixtures session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Charlie White.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a research associate at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel very lucky to be representing a
big team of researchers and extension
[SPEAKER_00]: educators and farmer collaborators and
organizations that work with us to share
[SPEAKER_00]: some results from our cover crop mixtures
research experiment that we've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: at Penn State and on collaborating farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you have traveled around the
countryside this time of year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen tents like this
cropping up in cover crop fields around
[SPEAKER_00]: your areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to wander inside one of
those tents, you might find a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: evangelist like this preaching about the
benefits of cover crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ray Archuleta.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many have seen a presentation by Ray
Archuleta?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of benefits, potential
benefits that cover crop mixtures can
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hearing a lot about those out in
the farming community and on the extension
[SPEAKER_00]: circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some good information,
good background information that has led
[SPEAKER_00]: to this belief in the benefit of cover
crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a long standing hypothesis,
the biodiversity ecosystem function
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis that says, you know,
as we increase diversity in a field,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're increasing the services and the
functionality that can be provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these functions could be plant biomass
production, it could be weed suppression,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial insects, nitrogen retention,
nitrogen supply, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our team, our very large team,
wanted to address this specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cover crop mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we increase the functionality and
service provisioning of mixtures in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover cropping system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, there's a very large team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone on this team has contributed
to the work that I'll be presenting this
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been funded through two projects
funded by the OREI program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main experiment is at the Rock
Springs Research Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using at least the phase of the
experiment that I'm going to describe
[SPEAKER_00]: today, the first three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use these six species in the
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two legumes, red clover and
Austrian winter pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two brassicas, canola and forage
radish, two grasses, cereal rye and oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plant families are also crossed
with winter hardiness classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these species up here on the
top, these are all reliably winter hardy
[SPEAKER_00]: species in our climate of central
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these species on the bottom,
these are all winter killed, mostly winter
[SPEAKER_00]: killed, Austrian winter pea at kind of
depends when you plant it, but more often
[SPEAKER_00]: than not in our climate, it's been winter
killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these six different species
that represent different plant families,
[SPEAKER_00]: different growth patterns in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we planted those six species in
monocultures as control comparisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also created four mixtures out
of those six species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mixtures we assembled to target
different functional goals and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a gradient of species diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the three species N treatment,
which has clover, pea and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is focused on nitrogen
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rye is in there to scavenge
nitrogen in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all planted after winter wheat
and going into corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also want to supply nitrogen to the
corn crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got the clover and the pea in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three species W, that's for weed
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in an organic cropping system
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not using any herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for the cover crop to
provide some weed suppression services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have oat in there as a fast growing
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then rye is a high biomass species in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we're going into corn,
we wanted to have some nitrogen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the clover in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four species mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to increase in species
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a clover, pea and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the same three species that
we have up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're adding canola as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And canola, being a brassica, has some
interesting tissue chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a species that will flower
relatively early in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canola is flowering before terminating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that we can attract some
beneficial insects or provide habitat and
[SPEAKER_00]: resources for native bee populations with
the canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got our six species mix
here, which is kind of the high diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: mix for our experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just looking to maximize
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, if our theory is right,
maximize the services and benefits that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get from the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at multifunctionality of
these cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've measured lots of different
services that they're providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just go around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biomass production, above ground
biomass we harvested in the fall and the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an anion exchange residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're measuring nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we actually use a biogeochemical
model to predict the nitrogen availability
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the C to N ratio and the total N
content of the cover crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're measuring cash crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going into corn silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Profitability, which is essentially the
change in silage yields from a cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment compared to the fallow control
minus the cost of the cover crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a partial budgeting technique of
looking at the profitability effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at pest suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a metarysium,
which is a soil fungus, entomopathogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus that can infect the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of different pest organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measured above ground weed biomass
in the cover crop stand in the fall and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at changes in soil
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data we're using in this analysis
is the active carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the potassium permanganate
extractable carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fraction of the soil carbon that
changes more rapidly when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: management induced change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all the services that we
measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're looking at
multifunctionality, what we actually did
[SPEAKER_00]: is we averaged standardized values for all
of these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: We averaged them together into what we're
calling a multifunctionality index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this figure shows you that
multifunctionality index across the levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of cover crop species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have average values for each of the
treatments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main pattern I want to show you
here is that there's not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between our cover crop
species richness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number of species of cover crops
that we have and the average
[SPEAKER_00]: multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: R squared of 0.03.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average of the mixtures was actually a
little bit better than the average of the
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see quite a spread in the
monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the P monoculture was more
multifunctional on average than many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mixes were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just cover crop species richness,
number of species alone was a very poor
[SPEAKER_00]: predictor of this multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look at other aspects of
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species richness isn't the only
component of diversity that might have an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the direction that we went in was to
look at functional diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there's a metric of
functional diversity called relative Rau's
[SPEAKER_00]: quadratic entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That as we increased in that functional
diversity metric, our average
[SPEAKER_00]: multifunctionality increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually kind of fits the hypothesis
of increasing diversity increases
[SPEAKER_00]: multifunctionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't happen to be species
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's functional diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also wanted to know why what was
driving this increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it an increase in the positive
benefits that cover crops provide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it a decrease in some of the
drawbacks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, nitrogen immobilization or
reducing cash crop yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be drawbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those negative aspects are actually
averaged into this mean value here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we decompose these average values
into the positive services, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: these black triangles, and the negative
disservices, which are the squares here,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we saw is that the services actually
didn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefits that we're getting from
cover crops, the positive benefits are
[SPEAKER_00]: staying the same as we increase diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the drawbacks that cover crops can
sometimes cause, like nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: immobilization or something like that,
those drawbacks are actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ameliorating the disservices that
cover crops can sometimes provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was an interesting finding that
diversity had this effect on ameliorating
[SPEAKER_00]: the disservices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's some potential benefits
to cover crop mixtures, but there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: some challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So challenge number one, understanding
functional diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't call up your seed company and
say, hey, give me your seed mix with the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest relative rouse quadratic entropy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll probably hang up the phone and
think you dialed the wrong number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anyone in this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can even tell me what relative rouse
quadratic entropy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone, come on, be brave if you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so there's a lot that we need to do to
enhance our literacy of functional
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is what's going to be driving
improvements in cover crop mixtures,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to understand what functional
diversity is and how to manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give you a quick little
primer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So functional diversity is all about the
functional traits that the plant species
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these traits, things like the fall
growth rate, the spring growth rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon and nitrogen ratio,
these traits are what drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: provisioning of these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start thinking about functional
diversity, you have to take these traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have to plot them in a
multi-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily here, we only have three traits
that we used in our analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can visualize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can visualize it in three dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can add as many traits as you want
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mathematically, it kind of takes care
of this multi-dimensional space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nice to visualize it in three
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are actually our six species with
their different trait values plotted in
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-dimensional trait space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can take the six species,
and you can start connecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all our mixtures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three species and the pea,
the rye, the red clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you connect these together,
you get essentially a volume of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at the center of the
trait space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this black dot here, that's the
centroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the distance that things
are from the centroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look at how evenly the biomass
is between all of the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those aspects, evenness,
richness, which is the volume of the
[SPEAKER_00]: space, divergence, which is how far apart
things are on average from the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are components of functional
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ran a number of different
functional diversity metrics that account
[SPEAKER_00]: for one or more of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can combine these in different metrics
that account for all three of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just one or two of the three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relative rouse quadratic entropy was
the one that was predictive of our
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this indicator takes into account
evenness and divergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is telling us is what you
want is you want to have species that are
[SPEAKER_00]: well spaced out from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to have even biomass across
all of the species in your mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if all of this biomass was even,
this would be a fairly divergent mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to the four species mix,
actually adding this canola in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: here, that reduces our divergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've put a species in there that
has traits that are very close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want traits that are evenly spaced
across the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a case where adding a
fourth species, if you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: species diversity as your indicator,
adding the fourth species actually reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: our functional diversity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's some traps that we
could fall into when we don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: functional diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might think, oh, let me add four or
five or six species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's another good example of where
having some species in the middle of this
[SPEAKER_00]: volume reduces the divergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think increasing our literacy around
functional diversity will help us create
[SPEAKER_00]: better mixtures, higher performing
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So challenge number two, you now have to
have evenness spread out around the edges
[SPEAKER_00]: of your trait space, which means you need
to manage cover crop mixtures to be even
[SPEAKER_00]: in their biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a figure that shows biomass,
or essentially the composition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop stand over time for the four
different mixtures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the composition at seeding,
so this is plants per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the composition at germination,
so the number of plants that germinated
[SPEAKER_00]: per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fall biomass composition and our
spring biomass composition for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these shaded areas,
different colors, represents a different
[SPEAKER_00]: species in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw is that across all of the
mixtures is in spring, we had a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: convergence towards cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal rye really dominated a lot of our
mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover was really a minor component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really didn't achieve very even
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this first stage of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the three species
nitrogen mix here in spring, the first
[SPEAKER_00]: year of the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cereal rye you see very tall here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover is just hanging on down there,
a little bit of Austrian winter pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big challenge for evenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew in the second phase of this
experiment we needed to do something about
[SPEAKER_00]: the evenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we switched up our species that we used
in these mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the second phase of the experiment,
we shifted rye to triticale and we shifted
[SPEAKER_00]: red clover to crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know anything about rye and red
clover, rye is the fastest growing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red clover is the slowest growing of the
legumes in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we basically set this mixture up
for failure because of the differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: spring growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to a slower growing
grass, the triticale, and a faster growing
[SPEAKER_00]: clover, the crimson clover, and we're
seeing much more even biomass in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge for evenness is that the
expression of these mixtures is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different across different farm sites
because of the soil fertility and the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate at each site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the four species mixture
planted four different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three were on-farm locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this shows the biomass composition
in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see, depending on these different
sites, like this site was almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: canola.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was almost all canola but a good bit
of pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we had canola and rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it was mostly rye, a little bit of
canola and pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the factors that we think are driving
this are the climate and the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: status.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the second phase of our work,
we've really focused on looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: gradients of climate and nitrogen status
at seeding to be able to predict how the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass might shift and try and adjust our
seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a postdoc on the project, Barbara
Berrybar, has a poster this evening
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at some of this work where we're
mechanistically changing planting dates
[SPEAKER_00]: and nitrogen fertility and looking at
differences in biomass composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd welcome you to stop by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think another challenge,
when we think about doing a spider plot
[SPEAKER_00]: like this, just the layout of this spider
plot implicitly implies that these
[SPEAKER_00]: services are somewhat independent of each
other and that it might actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to have high service levels on
all of these around if you theoretically
[SPEAKER_00]: have the optimal mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw from the data in the first
phase of this experiment this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: principal components analysis with all of
our services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this type of analysis, what it does is
it allows you to see what services are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with each other, which services
are opposed with each other, which
[SPEAKER_00]: services are independent of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way things shook out is we had
these bundles of services.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen supply, cash crop production,
and profitability were all related to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a service bundle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a different bundle of services were
actually opposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen retention, weed suppression,
and biomass production, these were
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat clustered together.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all opposed to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a trade-off between these
services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil carbon and pest suppression seem to
be relatively independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we manage this trade-off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in all of the data that we have from
on-farm experiments and research station
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments, we were able to, with the
nitrogen trade-off, at least, start to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what's driving this trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have cover crop management factors
that are affecting nitrogen supply and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also soil management factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the cover crop management factors,
increasing the non-legume seeding rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: having more grasses, more brassicas,
that increased our nitrogen retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good scavengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our nitrogen supply, keeping a low
biomass seed to end ratio in spring and
[SPEAKER_00]: fall, that increased our nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increasing these decreased nitrogen
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having more nitrogen in the biomass in the
spring increased nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trade-off between these two
services is actually this indirect effect
[SPEAKER_00]: where increasing the non-legume seeding
rate increased the seed to end ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: which decreased the nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at our soil management
factors here, we see that increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall soil nitrogen, so farms that applied
manure in the fall had a high nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: level in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a high leaching load.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had that high level of nitrate in
the soil, we needed more of a non-legume
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding rate to combat the nitrogen
retention, which hurt our nitrogen supply
[SPEAKER_00]: factor here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can manage our fall soil nitrogen
to have low soil nitrogen in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: so avoid fall manure applications,
avoid excessive tillage in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can stimulate mineralization,
we could get away with a lower non-legume
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding rate, which would help maintain
high nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we saw is that sites that
had high soil carbon levels or high soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter levels, there's nitrogen
coupled with that carbon, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: increased our nitrogen supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building high soil organic matter
levels can help offset some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative aspects of higher non-legume
seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other great indirect effect of
increased soil carbon that we saw is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it helped to maintain lower seed to end
ratios in our cover crop tissue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall and the spring, because there's more
nitrogen available in the soil from
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these effects interacting with
each other are kind of difficult to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed a little online calculator
that takes all of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a little graphical output and
helps you make a decision about what type
[SPEAKER_00]: of non-legume seeding rate to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of nitrogen supply you'll get
for your next corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is described in a paper that we
have published.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually download just the HTML
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is embedded in that single
file.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download that and use the
calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on getting some tutorial
videos posted on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's an attachment to this paper,
a supplement to this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download it now, or you can
contact me for the file if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixtures can increase multifunctionality,
but it requires intensive management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So functional diversity was more important
than species diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our data shows that you should target
functional evenness and divergence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass evenness is a challenge to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to select species with
compatible growth rates and adjust your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding rates to the climate and soil
nitrogen status of your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then services are bundled and have
trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to minimize that, nitrogen supply and
retention trade-off, it's actually about
[SPEAKER_00]: how you manage your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of an interesting outcome
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time for questions or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a question or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes ma'am.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just curious, the issue of nitrogen
capture in the fall versus availability in
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: What growth stage were on the cover crop
in the spring, were you terminating?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really varied depending on the
year and depending on the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that varied.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took that into account by the C to N
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially going to be a moving
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this calculator here, we actually
have, there's variables for your spring
[SPEAKER_00]: growing degree days and your fall growing
degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those actually shift the C to N ratio
behind the scenes in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can help you account for some
of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's still something to
the insurance effect of having,
[SPEAKER_00]: because yeah, some species might do better
or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I wonder if they really do have
the same functional traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be impacting negatively
by the same environmental extremes that
[SPEAKER_00]: might happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I think in terms of the insurance
hypothesis, I would say if you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about your traits around the edge,
try and populate more traits around the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge so that if you lose a few,
you still have others around the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily try and pile up
multiple species on three points of a
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
Yep.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there seed companies involved with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my actual question is, which seed
companies are most intelligent about the
[SPEAKER_01]: mix of the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think all the seed companies are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know their products better than
anyone else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that as a community,
we're all learning together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I would hope is that some
of this information can ultimately get
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated into how companies are making
their mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the challenge, though,
is that what we're seeing is that the same
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of seeding rates may not be
appropriate for every farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's going to be a challenge
for the seed companies because they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to mix their seed in bulk to some extent
and have a consistent lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think some of the farm tuning may
have to occur at the farm level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer may have to say, OK,
I'm going to procure this stream of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to decide what my
mixing ratio is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adds a little bit of extra
management challenge to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I probably used up my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
