[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Anu Rangarajan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the director of the Small Farm
Program and I'm really excited to share
[SPEAKER_01]: with you more about the program,
the kinds of things that we do,
[SPEAKER_01]: and help you understand a little bit more
about the way we sort of present ourselves
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world, but it's led to a little bit
of confusion, so I'm hoping I can clarify
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to give you first,
I'm just trying to advance my slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell you about the program itself and
where we sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the College of Ag and Life
Sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our funding comes primarily through small
grants and large grants from the USDA and
[SPEAKER_01]: we are supported in part with some funds
from the college and through Smith-Lever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What our goal is, and we were started in
2001, because at that time around the
[SPEAKER_01]: country there was a tremendous cry out for
greater attention to the needs of small
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This emerged from the famous Pickford case
in which USDA was sued for not addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: the needs of black farmers in the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they committed funding to develop small
farm programs across the country and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: from there that the Small Farm Program was
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I joined the program as the director in
2004 and have totally enjoyed myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really great staff that I'll
introduce you to over the process of our
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar today, but share with you really
the kinds of work that we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: to enhance the viability of small farms in
New York, the northeast, and in fact now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think our strengths are really best
defined through the way in which we try to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify critical issues that are
affecting small farms and their viability
[SPEAKER_01]: and then how we develop collaborations to
address those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are always thinking about the types of
publications or information resources that
[SPEAKER_01]: will support small farm development,
whether you are just thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: farming all the way to where you've been
farming for 20 years and you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: you may want to re-strategize your
business or add new commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to serve all those farms either
from initial startup all the way to when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're optimizing their performance to
developing a mature farm business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are doing a lot of things at all of
those points, but I think we're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: most known for our beginning farmer
support and so I'll be sharing with you
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have a network of educators
across the state that have committed to
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting small farm and new farm
development and in every county of the
[SPEAKER_01]: state we have one individual who's
identified and I'm not sure if any of you
[SPEAKER_01]: are those folks, but I would encourage you
to find out who because we do send
[SPEAKER_01]: resources out to them and those educators
may in either your county or surrounding
[SPEAKER_01]: counties have other resources locally to
share around small farm development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just thought I would back up and tell
you what is a small farm and the USDA
[SPEAKER_01]: defines that as a farm that has a gross
annual revenue of less than $250,000 a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: This number some people are pushing on it
thinking it should be closer to $350,000,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should know that 90% of the farms
in the country and in fact in New York fit
[SPEAKER_01]: this definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most rapid growth in farms at this
point are those farms that are very small
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be grossing less than $25,000 a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from the sort of energy that's
been focused on developing new farms,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot of people and probably
many of the people that you work with who
[SPEAKER_01]: are really just growing something in a
fairly small area and selling it very
[SPEAKER_01]: locally and supplementing their family
income and their own family food security.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are thrilled and excited to help
anyone who wants to identify themselves as
[SPEAKER_01]: a farmer and frankly the more people who
call themselves a farmer the better in my
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have observed that most our
farmers are really diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are often diversified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetable farms are diversified across
enterprises so they may have mixes of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and poultry or beef and fruit,
any combination, honey, maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have folks doing small scale value
added.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge diversity and I think a
really optimistic and positive sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities in our small farm sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit more from the people that
we actually are able to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Listserv and I'll show you how
to join that where we share updates every
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks on important resources or
information that are of interest to small
[SPEAKER_01]: producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we recently we did a survey
because we were trying to understand more
[SPEAKER_01]: for example about where do small farmers
actually sell their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really sharing this just again to
drive home the point that when you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the farm size they are a majority of them
are below 50 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even the highest percent of the
people that answered our call for
[SPEAKER_01]: information were farming less than 5
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this again may be many people you know
and you work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again that gross revenue quite low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the people that are
accessing and sort of communicating with
[SPEAKER_01]: us are making less than $25,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have farms that are making more than
$250,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while USDA may not call them small
I think that we create a home for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to use a much more flexible
definition of what's a small farm and I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell people that if you think you're a
small farm you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is it's really
contextual and it's a lot based on your
[SPEAKER_01]: community, the people you interact with
and where you go to sort of find your
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have some farms for example that
may participate in a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: programming that make well over $250,000
but they align with the values and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of energy of the small farm movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enterprises based on some surveys that
we've done recently really focus heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: on poultry and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again if you were even thinking about
starting a small farm these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest entry points as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The least amount of capital required for
getting into production at a more
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tell people at least $10,000 and some
leased land and well drained soil ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start a vegetable operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just again to give you a sense
of where we're seeing the energy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of growth across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of our farms have not been in
business for that long and this is part of
[SPEAKER_01]: a result of our new farm project which has
been really out there and recruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: people into the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over 60% of the people that we are
reaching have been farming for less than
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years but we do have quite a few that
are what we call the sort of mature farms
[SPEAKER_01]: over 15 years in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just really I want to just give you
a little bit of background on who we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been serving traditionally and we know
that that's changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're developing resources to
address some of the changes in that
[SPEAKER_01]: audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and the way that Lori and Jen had
shared with me some of your interests is
[SPEAKER_01]: that there may be individuals you work
with that really would love to scale up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and maybe add some income to
their home and or their youth and want to
[SPEAKER_01]: start some kind of a business and
experience what that is to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a tremendous amount of
energy and excitement in the small farm
[SPEAKER_01]: sector for entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know for example that the interest in
local foods is growing and that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for farm products and direct sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally we could dream of 25% of all of
our food being sourced locally in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Tompkins County we've achieved that
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we think about the rest of the
country there's a lot of challenges with
[SPEAKER_01]: that but we still keep working towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York State there's a growing number
of CSAs in farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're all familiar with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that we've faced with these
is that there's some saturation happening
[SPEAKER_01]: in these markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have found that some of our
producers are really interested in new
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale markets that are sort of like
direct marketing but you're going direct
[SPEAKER_01]: to a wholesale institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So food hubs are an example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some institutions are really interested in
buying direct groceries like Wegmans and
[SPEAKER_01]: others and the independent grocers are
starting to enter this scene of rhyming to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide easy to access wholesale markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then restaurants which have been a
stronghold for many of our small
[SPEAKER_01]: producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see that for entrepreneurs not
only developing and creating products for
[SPEAKER_01]: direct markets but also thinking about
diversifying their markets to include
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale and different sorts of
strategies primarily to manage risk and to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure some more farm security.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of our work and I'll share with
you some resources that are emerging to
[SPEAKER_01]: support both the direct markets but really
the wholesale market readiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is a list of different things I
want to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do this primarily by
doing a tour of the website because if you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't been to our website it can be a
little bit daunting because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of information there but I wanted to share
with you what I felt are really important
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that you may need to know about
that can support your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that we've designed these
really to help educators across the state
[SPEAKER_01]: get farms to do some of the work on their
own before they start taking up a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to help with designing
materials that can help you be more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient, to give you easy to access
resources that you can share with these
[SPEAKER_01]: new farmers or small farms that might come
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also we want to hear from you
what you feel are resources that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward because that's where I think
we can do a lot to support your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to shift now to the website
and I hope you can see this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everyone see this website?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing to note at our home
page and you can see at smallfarms.cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: .edu is we feature events that are coming
up across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these events, for example,
co-managing farm stewardship with food
[SPEAKER_01]: safety gaps and conservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a resource, for example,
that's been released, microloans,
[SPEAKER_01]: grazing methods, and opportunity for
learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some events or activities that
we want people to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this page I wanted to point out to you
the strategy to join our list.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so down here in the corner it says
sign up for the e-news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really encourage folks to sign into
this e-news using this template.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few questions we like to know
and I can even try to extract from you the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of people who are gardeners or
homesteaders for aspiring farmers that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been subscribing to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was any interest from you to know
who in your own county is already
[SPEAKER_01]: interfacing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also are always really deeply
interested and committed to enhancing the
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity of our audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really ask and hope that people
can share with us more about their own
[SPEAKER_01]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are recently working really hard to
create supportive strategies for military
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans to come into agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ask about if they can self-identify
as a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll share more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, from the home page across the
top there's a whole bunch of buttons here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to probe a few of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to probe the quarterly a little
bit, share with you some more about
[SPEAKER_01]: projects and resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go into the resource tab you
will find some of our most popular guides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one I want to show you is
this guide to farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we developed this years ago and this
has been one of our flagship publications
[SPEAKER_01]: from the guide to farming in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get calls from individuals who are
either interested in farming or have more
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about business structure or
strategy, marketing considerations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would encourage you to sort of spend
some time at this website and see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can find here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have resources on developing a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, different structures and the
issues that they are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all designed, all of these
fact sheets are designed to be either
[SPEAKER_01]: downloaded as a full guide or you can use
them independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it tells you when we've revised it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually, when there's new
information we revise every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a whole group of authors
that have helped us with this to revise
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the fact sheet, for example,
on farm insurance, which will tell you the
[SPEAKER_01]: issues around having supplemental or
product liability insurance and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: information to really make sure that small
farmers are considering risk management
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they're going to protect
themselves and their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is just the guide to
farming in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did print it at one time and when we
printed I think we handed out over 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: copies and really the excitement for this
came from established farms, not just new
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is information in here that any
farmer really needs to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so definitely explore this guide and
hopefully you will find it interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful in the work that you're doing with
gardeners who may be wanting to scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this particular resource is just
one of several that I think are important
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to dig in a little bit to the
urban guide in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually I'll just do that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the urban guide to farming,
we use the same model of the guide to
[SPEAKER_01]: farming in New York, but here we're
focused strictly on an urban environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, the topics are
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are similar, but major and we
encourage people to use the general guide
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here you may have some specialized
issues, for example dealing with soil
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this again is printable as a fact sheet
and you can use this to share with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's really interested in doing
urban farming or has a concern about soil
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous number of resources
that are linked and we're currently in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of doing a complete update of the
guide and adding a few north more
[SPEAKER_01]: sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sections that we want to add are
focused in on mushrooms and agroforestry
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as some more dive down into
hydroponics and these new sort of vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: farming strategies that everybody seems to
be excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a bit more about the two guides
to farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other resources are the on-farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have people doing poultry,
this on-farm poultry slaughter,
[SPEAKER_01]: this was driven by a liability insurance
issue where a bunch of farmers were
[SPEAKER_01]: calling us and saying they do not,
they're getting canceled from insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: policies and that was a big concern to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we acted very quickly to respond to
that working with insurance companies to
[SPEAKER_01]: create what we felt were guidelines to
support safe handling on farms for poultry
[SPEAKER_01]: slaughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there's an exemption under a
thousand birds, we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are really, if they're doing it on
farm, that they're considering all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: components of setting up a good system
that's both efficient for them for labor
[SPEAKER_01]: and safe for the quality of the birds
they're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an online course that complements
this and Lynne Bliven has been a real
[SPEAKER_01]: leader for us and she's out in Western New
York and an Extension educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another important guide is the guide to
direct farming of livestock and poultry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a guide that's a little bit
outdated but Martha and Tatiana have
[SPEAKER_01]: agreed to help us with updating this and
so we're hoping that this coming summer we
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually update the guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this has probably been one of our most
popular resources that we've produced
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many questions around
both slaughterhouses and processing,
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations and then how to handle and
direct market poultry and livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure you knew about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that really gives you a few of the
overviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as timely information, it really is
through our update.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so please do sign up for the update.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't been receiving them,
but there's a ton of resources that we
[SPEAKER_01]: both share on our website homepage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have these inside in the
updates that are come as an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember, I think here is
the list of the archives under our news
[SPEAKER_01]: button.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see, for example,
if you open up one, the one that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: last, the most recent one, one of our
recent ones, it tells you both different
[SPEAKER_01]: things to be happening at Cornell,
different announcements and then events
[SPEAKER_01]: that people should know about and then
some job opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of people sharing job
opportunities with us and then grants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is our way of trying to
provide timely information to individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: who, you know, people that are developing
their farms looking for support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I really do encourage you to
join and get the update.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other flagship publication for us is
our Small Farm Quarterly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a quarterly magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if any of you have ever
written for it, but we would welcome
[SPEAKER_01]: submissions because our editorial team is
made up of mostly you, educators from
[SPEAKER_01]: around the state who help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they provide articles or they recruit
writers for the articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an entirely volunteer publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky to have a nice partnership
with the publications who put out country
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we generate all of the content and
they do the printing and put it in to the
[SPEAKER_01]: country folks as an insert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes to over 30,000 families across
the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's exciting here is that,
you know, anywhere in our website,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can search a topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if you were interested in
grazing, you could hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it would do is basically give you
a list of a bunch of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: articles that we have both in the
quarterly, historically.
[SPEAKER_01]: This top one is about grazing online
course, which I'll tell you about a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just click on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will pop you to the article that was
written by Nancy Glaser, Educator in
[SPEAKER_01]: Western New York, talking about renting
grazing land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this was originally published in
the quarterly, but we want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that all of these are available for folks
going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see here in that same
issue, there was a whole bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: articles that may be of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think let me just double check here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time, we have always struggled
because as I've described, small farms are
[SPEAKER_01]: really diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you pick where to sort of focus
your efforts in trying to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of such a diverse sector of
our farm, our farming culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, what we have done
every other year is we host what we call a
[SPEAKER_01]: small farm summit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that summit, we recruit broadly across
the state using a webinar type format.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll have up to seven or eight
sites around the state where we ask
[SPEAKER_01]: producers to gather, along with those
interested in their success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So educators, we get members of different
nonprofits, Soil and Water and our CS,
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of folks would gather in these
different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we try to do is really focus
on asking them to help us prioritize the
[SPEAKER_01]: directions that a program like this should
take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ask them to gather in regions
because it's really important to us that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always cultivating regionally strong
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so getting people into the room is so
much more important, I think, than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the hardest thing in our
culture now is to actually have people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like they develop meaningful
relationships So we have intentionally
[SPEAKER_01]: designed this summit, even though it's
only every two years, we're hoping that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can really help people connect with those
around them that can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, in 2012, we actually had a survey and
we had over 700 small farmers respond to
[SPEAKER_01]: help us prioritize whether they thought
are the real opportunities to enhance the
[SPEAKER_01]: viability of small farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top five that came out of that was
distribution to reach local markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring out how to do this, how to help
small producers, no matter the scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get themselves into local and
regional markets more effectively and more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economic impact of small farms on
communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a huge question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these small farms that are
supporting local food and hiring local
[SPEAKER_01]: kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the impact of them on their
farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And interesting, I found it really
interesting that this was the second
[SPEAKER_01]: priority from a farm community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping deal with livestock processing
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we identify where they should be
and how do we expand or improve our access
[SPEAKER_01]: to those processing facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Financing and then greater investment in
research and extension and other services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just giving you a flavor of the
kinds of information we get when we ask
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers where should we focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I found really
interesting is we asked farm, small
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, you know, where do they see
themselves going in two years as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: the new ways they want to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want to highlight is this
growth and interest in wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in two years a bunch, currently the
majority of our farmers are using farm
[SPEAKER_01]: stands or farm markets and CSAs and all of
these you picks as their primary direct
[SPEAKER_01]: channels in the way that they share their
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this idea of selling to restaurants
and food hubs and groceries has really
[SPEAKER_01]: been interesting and exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some very small producers in
the state who are doing this and finding
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're being really successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we've done as a
program is invest in developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: curriculum to treat, to help new producers
or existing farmers become more wholesale
[SPEAKER_01]: market ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're rolling this out on April 18th
and 19th.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two day in service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your colleagues are the instructors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have folks from across the state that
have worked with us to develop this and
[SPEAKER_01]: Violet Stone in our program has been
leading this effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the materials will help producers make
decisions on how to shift to a wholesale
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they match the production to the
demands of these markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the culture among these different
types of markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do we figure out how to work
together and foster these opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: within regions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just really more of a teaser and
something I want you to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a professional development
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that we want to have attend are
people like you, educators around the
[SPEAKER_01]: state who may be getting these kinds of
questions or anticipate that it may become
[SPEAKER_01]: a bigger part of their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to put that in mind in your
planning and if it's something that's of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'd like to do now is go back
again to our website and share a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: more resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is that wholesale marketing piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baskets to pallets, preparing small and
mid-sized farms to enter food hubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatives, restaurants, and groceries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the basis of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a wholesale market watch and a
listserv that you can sign up and we share
[SPEAKER_01]: information about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had a series of webinars that
if you're really curious about
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what small farms are
interested in this, I would encourage you
[SPEAKER_01]: to go and take a look at some of these
webinars where different farmers have
[SPEAKER_01]: shared with us their transition from
direct to wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would be surprised how small some
of these farms are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a big group of folks and
this is the group of your colleagues that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been helping to write this curriculum
so stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's something that you might be
interested in going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few other things that are
happening at the program and what are
[SPEAKER_01]: other areas that I can't really dig into
with you right now but I just wanted you
[SPEAKER_01]: to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a whole new effort focused on
helping farmers who are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: grazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a grazing initiative and we
also have a program that's focused quite
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily on tillage and soil health
management for small producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are two projects that are really
specific and really focused on a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular sector and we do take these
things on periodically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to focus in on our beginning
farmer project, the Northeast Beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually emerged from all of you
in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kept getting, we started having
conversations with educators that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with and they kept saying,
you know, I cannot believe the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: people coming to me with interest in
starting a farm and I don't know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we observed is that
everybody around the state was so busy
[SPEAKER_01]: creating their own curricula and trying to
put together their own materials and it
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed like kind of a crazy waste of a lot
of people's time to not have a centralized
[SPEAKER_01]: resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when we really brought
together a team of educators and created
[SPEAKER_01]: the Beginning Farmer Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision is that every new farmer in New
York has access to the support,
[SPEAKER_01]: information, and training they need to be
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's our mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to be that anyone who wants
to farm, regardless of where they're at,
[SPEAKER_01]: can do this and have people that can help
them with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to do that, what we have
really done and worked really hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned, is create small farm and
beginning farmer contacts within every CCE
[SPEAKER_01]: office around the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are welcome to add you to our list
online of references at our homepage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Who Can Help tab and we are
happy to make sure that you're listed
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also, in our work, cultivated a
network of organizations in New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast that specifically support
new farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just Extension educators that
are out there doing this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have incubator farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all sorts of people that are
really passionate about helping people
[SPEAKER_01]: start farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we try to do through the small
farm program is professional development
[SPEAKER_01]: for those individuals to try to make sure
that the educators and those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting new farm development really
have connection to the best resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: information, materials to make their jobs
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really do see ourselves both as we
provide information and resources directly
[SPEAKER_01]: to new producers, but then we want to
cultivate a learning community among the
[SPEAKER_01]: educators that are working in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have met annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the Beginning Farming Learning
Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we usually meet at the Sentry House
around end of October up in Albany because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's actually six hours from everywhere
in the Northeast, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do an in-service training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I don't know if any of you
have been there, but it's actually usually
[SPEAKER_01]: a really dynamic and fun gathering where
we're learning from each other how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to review with you just
quickly some of the offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have online courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are six-week non-credit classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have currently, I think we're up to
17 classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had over 1,300 people go into these
classes and a 42% report increasing their
[SPEAKER_01]: own revenue in their farm after taking
these classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are, again, facilitated
primarily by extension educators who have
[SPEAKER_01]: developed a passion for working with new
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The model that we're using is that people
are paying for these and we're paying
[SPEAKER_01]: educators to help teach them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also covers the administrative
management, which is a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: administrative stuff that has to happen
behind the scenes with this for Erica
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she's been our real shepherd for
the online courses, one of our staff
[SPEAKER_01]: members.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are always looking for new
instructors, so just so you know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to take you on a tour
of some of our resources on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let me do that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this website currently is separate from
the Small Farm Program website,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's caused some confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we created a separate website
was partly because some of our funding,
[SPEAKER_01]: we needed to have a place to keep a lot of
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also has had such an energy and
drive the development of the Beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer Project and the tools and the
resources that it was a lot to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to give you the heads up
that we are imagining bringing the two
[SPEAKER_01]: sites back together going forward,
because a lot of the new farms that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been cultivating are actually hitting the
point where they really are more
[SPEAKER_01]: established and are going to need a
different kind of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are tooling up for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I just realized
that I cannot get past this little sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: my monitor screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I think that this question about
where do you start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess there's getting started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these what we have created is this
section called Plan Your Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this portal and basically
collection of resources is really there to
[SPEAKER_01]: help someone who wants to work on their
own start to get into thinking about is
[SPEAKER_01]: farming for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: What commodities do I want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to do the planning for this
farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a whole series of worksheets that
you can do with somebody, or you can send
[SPEAKER_01]: them there and say, just start to do your
own thinking and planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's done using a sort of question
narrative where people can actually go
[SPEAKER_01]: through and get some guidance as to how to
narrow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I need to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I finance it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get a grant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are structured as tutorials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in this tutorial on goals
and skills, what's really interesting is
[SPEAKER_01]: we complement both the written material
with videos of farmers and new farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: around the state who really have been able
to clearly articulate some of the issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and the strategies that have helped them
be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would definitely send somebody to
this planning your farm hub as a place to
[SPEAKER_01]: get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the challenges I think that all
of you may face is people, they want
[SPEAKER_01]: someone to sometimes hold their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would encourage you to push back and
say, show me what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they totally, I just see a comment
from Jen that they want us to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that farming as an
entrepreneur is an individualized action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And starting with information and giving
them, we're hoping this portal helps you
[SPEAKER_01]: say, look, dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where you get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully you can use some of these,
you can point people to some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that I've shared with you to
help them start thinking about farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we know is doing this kind of
stuff online is really, in some ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a certain kind of learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know we have lots of different
learners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some people that just don't
even want to do online teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have encouraged and support and
worked with a network of educators around
[SPEAKER_01]: the state who do these so you want to farm
type workshops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you haven't done one of those or
you're interested, I would encourage you
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to the Who Can Help tab here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know who else is doing it
in your area, but I bet you could find
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody locally, if you're not aware of
them, who is doing these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: trainings within several county area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't feel like you have to do this
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you aren't able to find someone,
just send us a note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send me or Erica an email and we will try
to connect you with people who can help
[SPEAKER_01]: you figure out how to address this need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these worksheets are really meant to be
a self-guided process for planning a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: startup.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's become our real flagship is our
online courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a whole bunch of online
courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually going to be
restructuring the way we present them
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are telling us, like,
I don't know which to take first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how to approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But none of these have prerequisites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're six-week facilitated courses that
help you understand all the aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Square One, one of our most popular
classes, is the very first class.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is farming for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your own motivations?
[SPEAKER_01]: What resources do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What might fit you as far as an
enterprise?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the kinds of questions that are
addressed in Square One.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be a place where you direct
people who come to you, like, I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to start a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, go do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take this course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's talk after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, it's not about dismissing
them, but trying to help them help
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've structured these classes to
be interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous number of resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's resources that people have access
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's often two people that are teaching
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some basics about how this class
is structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our new classes that keeps filling
up, and it's really interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: is farm scale mushroom cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve Gabriel, who's on our staff now,
has been teaching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time, he's offered it twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fills up each time, 50 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of excitement and
interest in something like mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether they're growing it on logs or
they're using other strategies with bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a class that it's an unusual
class, and it's an unusual crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do find a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make sure you were aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another part of the online courses and
something that's been really helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to find, is our voices of
experience videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so again, another way of helping
people learn is by learning stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: is by seeing stories and learning from
other farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started building this video
collection in 2008, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some funding from USDA as well
as from Farm Viability to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a whole collection of videos
on our YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's YouTube Cornell Small Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, I'm not sure if you can
hear this or not, but here's one from
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Diamond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these videos are, some of them have
been like this one on castrating pigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how many people have
watched this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are some farms that are in and
around Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they represent really diversified
farms, and they represent different
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives on how to do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they include videos about the
farmer themselves, sort of how they
[SPEAKER_01]: approach different activities,
how they may market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a couple of new ones at
the bottom on draft horses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don Hughes, who's here locally,
has started the Draft Animal Power,
[SPEAKER_01]: DAP Network, and has been committed to
draft animal work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are seeing more and more people
expressing interest in draft animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to connect them to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many videos that organize
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's just, I can't remember how many
videos we have on here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's different projects as well and
different videos that we've brought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have a video here on Farm
Service Agency microloans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot of people that are
interested in that program to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: small operation, so understanding what the
issues are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also had a program for educators
that was focused on cultural competency
[SPEAKER_01]: for new farm development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we heard from two leaders,
two individuals who are leading local
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofits, small nonprofits, and how
they're addressing issues of diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: their programming, and what were some of
the challenges that they faced in working
[SPEAKER_01]: across difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all sorts of different
materials here on the program,
[SPEAKER_01]: but on small farm startup, as well as how
to build hoop houses and just lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would encourage you to explore the
video collection, Farming in Action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think then the other resources that I
wanted to point you to are, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: on that home page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look across the top of this
beginning farmer project, we've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through the tutorials, the online courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also then these resources,
the videos, the guides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have these articles that come
from Small Farm Quarterly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have wanted to collect them
together in a way that these articles then
[SPEAKER_01]: represent different aspects of getting
started in farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, another way for people who are
interested in just hearing stories and
[SPEAKER_01]: learn best by stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are written by a diversity of
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some educators, some farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a lot of profiles of new
farmers here at the bottom as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, again, consider this another
resource to help people think through
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not getting into farming is
something for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other piece, I haven't really
alluded to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much, but there is a whole bunch
of information that is buried in these
[SPEAKER_01]: sites that we consider like the farmer's
bookshelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are linked sometimes to online
resources or how to find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in both the beginning farmer site as
well as the Cornell Small Farm Program
[SPEAKER_01]: site, you will find resources,
tremendous numbers of resources that are
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of the small farm site,
this is where we really try to focus in on
[SPEAKER_01]: resources for established farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in production, you can see
that we have this wide array of materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been collected together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these aren't the only materials out
there, but there's a few that we felt were
[SPEAKER_01]: really good or well done or easily
accessible online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, something that you might be able to
use in your own work to share information
[SPEAKER_01]: with individuals who come to you directly
or even to be able to forward them to some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these resources so they can explore on
their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's both the learning information,
but then kind of the diagnosis and the
[SPEAKER_01]: support for decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the piece that's
critical for us is how do you support good
[SPEAKER_01]: decision making on farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of our online courses are
related directly to decision making.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we have a course on holistic
management, which is the entire framework
[SPEAKER_01]: for decision making in which you really
consider environment, economics,
[SPEAKER_01]: and social goals that you might have as an
individual or a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply the decision making
framework to your life in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's an example of something that we
feel is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just technical information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really how do you put it all
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you put it together in a way
that feeds your soul, feeds your energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really plays to your skills?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to think about all of that,
the soft skills development as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: technical skills development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this whole piece of scale up,
and I think this may be relevant to some
[SPEAKER_01]: of you, is we recognize that it's a real
trick to go from growing at a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: scale and then wanting to really actually
change your practices and move into
[SPEAKER_01]: something at a larger scale, a more
commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have some advanced enterprise
online courses that are designed for
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting farm diversification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the mushroom one is one,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a high tunnel class that's
starting shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have both vegetable and berry
production classes that are online to give
[SPEAKER_01]: people the start or deepen their skill
sets around those two production systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a grazing course.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these are meant to sort of help
with the scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be adding food safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even adapting to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some of the courses that
we're adding that are really meant to help
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our current funding supports also,
we have funding from the USDA to help
[SPEAKER_01]: those individuals who are maybe three to
five years in and want to re-strategize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're actually doing is helping
farms create what we call profit teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are teams of consultants often
extension educators who they hire to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them improve their own entrepreneurship
business training and planning and help
[SPEAKER_01]: them make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really important decisions to grow the
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of the farms who participate get
$2,000 as a grant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to commit $500 of their
own funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have $2,500 to work with over 18
months to pay people to consult with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's a feed, a person to help
them with their nutrition plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's something to help them with their
disease management plan, if it's about how
[SPEAKER_01]: do I improve the quality for a wholesale
market, it's up to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to know is how they really
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all we care is that they find the
right people to help them take the
[SPEAKER_01]: business to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very much one on one
consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing we're doing is
developing these sort of intensive
[SPEAKER_01]: training programs that will be on scaling
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's really tricky to
go from a very small scale even to move
[SPEAKER_01]: from sort of less than a half an acre to
one acre to five acres and then to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's tend to be breaks there like
well actually at over five acres and then
[SPEAKER_01]: over 25 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like some natural breaks
in scale that suggest a scaling up of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you pick and how do you pick
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to be most adaptable
going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our training programs will focus on
scaling up equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the wholesale market readiness,
which we think diversifying markets is
[SPEAKER_01]: really important as we move into this,
as we see this growth in local foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I just want to talk about
and share with you is this whole area of
[SPEAKER_01]: work that we're doing right now focused on
military veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really trying to create pathways
for veterans to find employment on farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to actually start farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to draw your attention to it
because I think that all of you are really
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and interfacing with a lot of
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are getting more veterans returning
from service that we are trying to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them integrate back into community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's agriculture or gardening
or farming, we know there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful benefits to them to be involved
with this kind of physical work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to just, I can share more
with you, but I think I want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough time for conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a whole new area of work
that's developing around supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this August, we're going to host a
one week intensive that's called Armed to
[SPEAKER_01]: Farm for military veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will take place in central New York
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was western New York last year,
it's central New York this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next year it will be in eastern
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you feel people, you know people who
might be interested, please let us know
[SPEAKER_01]: and pay attention to our announcements
when they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I start to close, I want to make
sure you know the folks that can help you
[SPEAKER_01]: in the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a really awesome staff at the
small farm program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Violet Stone who leads our wholesale
market stuff and general inquiries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Erica who's provided leadership to the
beginning farmer project and online
[SPEAKER_01]: courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ryan Mar, he has facilitated the educator
network and also is really focused in on
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health management and creating
appropriate technologies for small farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Weiss, he's new to the program and
he's leading our current beginning farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: grant, but also shepherding the veterans
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Gabriel who many of you might know
is his background in agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wrote the book Forest Farming with Ken
Mudge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's now joined our program and he's
being the managing editor of the small
[SPEAKER_01]: farm quarterly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kathy Peck who is brand new to the
program but is helping us dig more
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressively into how do we help cultivate
local food systems and networks for
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers to really grow their businesses in
this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's really all I wanted to
share with you which is sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: program, what we're up to and
[SPEAKER_01]: well you can always reach out to me or to
any of the staff at the program and just
[SPEAKER_01]: send us an email if you're looking for
something and you can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
