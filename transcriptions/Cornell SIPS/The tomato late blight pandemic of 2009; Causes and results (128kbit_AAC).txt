[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak to
horticulture today about this really
[SPEAKER_01]: bizarre event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many of you grow tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of you had problems in 2009?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was absolutely bizarre, and I
thought I'd just like to explain a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made the national and international
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a quote from the New York Times on
the 17th of July, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says,
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in August, there was this
headline that appeared in the New York
[SPEAKER_01]: Times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And according to this guy, he says,
And that was from an organic tomato grower
[SPEAKER_01]: who ships directly to high-end markets in
New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he lost a lot of his tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think many people had the same
experience throughout the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my tomatoes weren't too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, I went to Empire Farm days in
August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking with some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy who lived not too far from me,
a couple miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live in the town of Enfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I lost all my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, whoa, I'm going to start
spraying my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually did OK in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to do is to give you some very
introductory comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be a few of you who don't know
that much about late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions about late blight,
I'm going to pass them to Brian,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I talk a lot about late blight in
my class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to talk, first of all,
about migrations of the pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora infestans, worldwide
migrations, but also migrations that have
[SPEAKER_01]: happened within the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll focus specifically on what happened
in 2009, and then what's happened
[SPEAKER_01]: subsequent to 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll finish by giving some predictions
about management of this particular
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to describe to you, and actually
what I should do is ask Brian to describe
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the asexual cycle of phytophthora
infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to illustrate it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This organism reproduces by producing
sporangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a micrograph of a sporangium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, it's giving birth to a zoospore.
[SPEAKER_01]: These zoospores are about 10 micrometers
in diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're interesting, because they have
two flagella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a schematic drawing of them,
a forward-directed tinsel-type flagellum
[SPEAKER_01]: and a posterior-directed whiplash
flagellum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are immortal for minutes to up to
an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this zoospore lands on a leaf and
penetrates the leaf, it can produce a very
[SPEAKER_01]: small lesion that looks like this in about
three or possibly four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes at least two, two and a half to
three days before you see any symptom at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is probably three to four days
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a couple of days, that lesion can
expand, and the pathogen has grown
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout this tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that lesion is subjected to very
moist weathered leaf wetness for 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 11, or 12 hours, it can sporulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, how am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a pathogen sporulating on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Brian, how many sporangia are on that
leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he wants to hear your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't deserve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes with the name?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a potato leaflet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pathogen goes to both tomatoes and
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually more famous, as I'll say in
just a minute, as a potato pathogen than
[SPEAKER_01]: as a tomato pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, to people who've worked with it
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who grow tomatoes don't know that
necessarily, but it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, there are probably more than a
million sporangia on that leaflet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to look at this with a
dissecting scope or a hand lens,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd see the sporangia among the
trichomes on this potato leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to look at it through a
compound microscope, you'd see the
[SPEAKER_01]: sporangiophores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a sporangium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the weather changes in the morning,
particularly, and the dew drives off of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf, these sporangia are actually
discharged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one that has been discharged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can be aerially dispersed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they land on a surface that has free
moisture, they can germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the asexual cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really dramatically important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can happen in between four and a half
to five days, depending on weather,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending upon how susceptible the host
crop is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so dramatic that it can turn a
field of potatoes that looks something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this within eight or nine or 10 days
to a field of potatoes that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in another eight or nine days,
it can look something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can tell you that every last bit of
potato, and this is a potato field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every last bit of potato foliage has been
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you'll see some green here and here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pigweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a grass of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the potato foliage was dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took this picture in August of 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a late season cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should have been green until
mid-September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was totally dead well over a month
before it should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was caused by late blight,
caused by phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to destroying foliage,
this pathogen also infects tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a really important fact,
is that the pathogen can overwinter in
[SPEAKER_01]: infected tubers in a potato storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if there are tubers that are left in
the soil and the tubers don't freeze,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it can survive in volunteers the next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it can survive in great big piles of
cold potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of which is pictured here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took this picture in, I think,
1994 also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually Don Halseth is pictured in
this image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don, do you know where you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: You were in Steuben County, yeah,
but I mean right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good you knew where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is tons and tons of tubers that
were dumped because the grower had
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested the tubers about a week
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd had late blight in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really warm and wet that harvest
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those conditions are just perfect for
infection with phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the potatoes were put into storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And late blight lesions on a tuber are
spectacular places for erwinia carotavra
[SPEAKER_01]: or pectobacterium carotavrum can infect
and cause soft rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these potatoes were just melting in
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a huge storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don, do you remember how large that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about 10,000 hundred weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you imagine that these potatoes
were about four or five feet deep all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way down into the bottom of that gully,
which was 40 or 50 feet down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm thinking of is the amount of
pectrobacterium that was going downstream
[SPEAKER_01]: from this pile of potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably most of the pathogen did not
survive in this because the tubers were so
[SPEAKER_01]: rotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk a little bit about the
sexual cycle of this organism because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's also important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of an oogonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's an antheridium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the female structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the male structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a nucleus migrates from the
antheridium into the oogonium and
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizes the oogonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that fertilization occurs,
then we get an oospore identified here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's very thick walled
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: These oospores can survive for years in
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as we know, that does not yet
happen in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are places in the world where it
does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly happens in central Mexico,
in the highlands of central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the last 20 to 30 years,
we know that it happens in northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, particularly in Scandinavia,
and also in northeastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in most places in the world and,
I think, also throughout the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, we don't know yet that oospores
occur because we don't think sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction is yet a factor in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people have heard about potato
late birth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the famine it caused in Ireland
in the mid-19th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: This book is actually a fascinating book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by a female author who took a male
pseudonym to write about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says 1845 to 1849.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just a chronicle of what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much emotion except the facts
and figures are so awful that they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: presented in a really bald way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were many cartoons, if you will,
in newspapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one from that period in which this
represents Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says help and says we are starving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Irish potato famine was really awful,
as many of you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late blight was not known to the western
world until the mid-19th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of the development of
this new disease in Europe starting in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1845.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first occurrence was detected in
Belgium at the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this new disease appeared later in
the season as we went through the summer
[SPEAKER_01]: of 1845.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until by the end of the season,
all of Ireland had been affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that Ireland was so
severely affected is that potatoes were
[SPEAKER_01]: just a huge component of the diet for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you were among the lowest
class, the cutters, smallholders,
[SPEAKER_01]: and landless laborers, your calorie intake
was from eating 12 pounds of potatoes a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for most of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that food source was destroyed,
you can see what it would do to one's
[SPEAKER_01]: calorie intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I learned, which was really
fascinating, is that potatoes probably
[SPEAKER_01]: caused a population explosion in Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no censuses in Ireland in the
18th or 19th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's estimated that the population of
Ireland at the end of the 18th century was
[SPEAKER_01]: about 3 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's estimated that by the mid-19th
century, it was about 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potatoes had become a major calorie source
in the end of the 18th century in Ireland,
[SPEAKER_01]: which enabled this huge population
explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't uncommon for mom and dad to have
18 kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could subsist on potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could heat a one-room stone house
with peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really created this very huge
population explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to talk about migrations
worldwide, but mainly in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I said mid-19th century for
Western science knowing about this disease
[SPEAKER_01]: is because it appeared first in the US,
maybe around Philadelphia, around New York
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1843.
[SPEAKER_01]: This illustrates how it radiated out from
1843 to 1845.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the questions is, where did this
organism come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to suggest to you that it
came from central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a significant debate about where
this organism came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was debated at the end of the 18th
century and through the 20th century,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least until the middle of the 20th
century, when everyone that is most
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist agreed that maybe it came from
central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the late 20th century,
some of my colleagues suggested,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, it didn't come from central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from South America, where potatoes
also originated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the developing data now will
confirm that it probably is originated in
[SPEAKER_01]: central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime before 1842, it could have come
from central Mexico to the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have come from the States to
Europe sometime before June of 1845.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's easy to imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: An infected tuber could be taken on a
ship, taken to Europe, and the pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: could sporulate from that infected tuber
and it could initiate disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or one possibility is that it might have
come directly from Europe, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: from central Mexico to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: From central Europe, it's very clear as to
how it moved, because there's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: active seed potato trade from Europe to
the rest of the world, except to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potatoes go to South America,
to Africa, to Asia, and all over from
[SPEAKER_01]: northwest Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to see how this organism
could get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the late 1980s, there was clearly a
migration from northern Mexico to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I know that it was from
northern Mexico is that we had been
[SPEAKER_01]: sampling in Sinaloa State prior to the
occurrence of new strains in both the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Northwest and also the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had found the very same genotypes of
Phytophthora infestans in northwest Mexico
[SPEAKER_01]: before they arrived in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really clear as to where our
populations came from in the late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to illustrate to you again is
how interestingly and how fast this
[SPEAKER_01]: organism can get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We detected this particular strain of
Phytophthora infestans in the summer of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1992.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Oswego County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not Tompkins County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Oswego County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got a sample from Maine in
1993, which was also the same genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, again, this U.S.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the next year, two, this same genotype
was spread throughout the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1994, it was in the eastern half of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 1995, it affected all of the
western potato production areas in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this this pathogen gets around in
infected tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those infected tubers go from the potato
seed producing areas all over from they go
[SPEAKER_01]: from, in this case, Maine, all the up and
down the west coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York produces seed tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon, and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington all produce seed tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go in trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this organism gets around in trucks for
intercontinental migrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1994, when I took those pictures,
was really a severe year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture was taken in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted, there were several
reports in the newspaper about the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: of this disease on pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a farmer, Viren Chapman,
who grew potatoes near Utica, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lost his entire crop in 1994 to late
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He declared bankruptcy the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he died about a year or two after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my conclusion was that the stress of
losing his crop, losing his farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: were so severe that it caused him it cost
him his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all because of this strain of
phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was resistant to what had been one of
the most effective fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, when they saw late blight,
would spray this fungicide, methamoxam,
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting it to completely halt the
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that didn't happen, they didn't
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and this disease is so explosive
that it just destroyed these potato crops
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1994 and 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so what happened in 2009?
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our own Abby Seaman, we got this
note on June 23, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said to the late blight listserv,
she said, late blight has been found at
[SPEAKER_01]: several locations in our reporting area
this past week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's a quote from Meg McGrath
on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, a sample just came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of sporulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The field had been sprayed with fungicide,
and growers are taking action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the next day, the 24th of
June, 2009, Keith Perry, who's my next
[SPEAKER_01]: door neighbor on the third floor of Plant
Science Building, came in with a tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that was severely infected with late
blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, Bill, what do you think of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This got late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, where'd that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to Lowe's and took pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are tomato transplants that were
for sale on June 24, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only Lowe's, but Walmart, Home Depot,
and there was one more that had these same
[SPEAKER_01]: transplants for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were really all heavily infected
with phytophthora and festans.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are large lesions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been there for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these plants had been infected for
really quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the 24th of June in 2009,
we knew that Suffolk County had infected
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato plants, and we knew that Tompkins
County had infected tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a note from Tom Zitter on the
26th of June in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said,
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, I also received word
that late blight infected plants from
[SPEAKER_01]: large retailers are found in Sarah,
Pennsylvania, Schenectady County,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as far east as Presque Isle,
Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Presque Isle, Maine is in Aroostook
County, Maine, where there's 70,000 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of potatoes being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the 26th, these counties had
reported late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the 8th of July in 2009, these counties
had reported late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I thought, I better get
out of Plant Science Building and go look
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows where this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that looks like it's over near Fall
Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is on Freeze Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those spots is a late blight
lesion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, this is a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are dead and dying leaves that
are infected by phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same garden, I looked at potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, they were infected also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by the 16th of June, there had been
these many counties reported late blight
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the 17th of August, this many
counties had been reporting late blight in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I'd just do a cumulative
tally of the number of reports to our
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnostic lab about late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the first event was
in mid-June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the report on the 23rd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the 24th, the 25th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes way up to above 140
reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to compare that with 2008,
the number of reports of late blight in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were three samples received by
our diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them was late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all suspected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was zero late blight in New York
reported to our diagnostic lab in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2009, we had this kind of
reporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also thought I'd say that 37 of these 49
reports that occurred over a period of six
[SPEAKER_01]: days were from retail stores, which was
not normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of our colleagues in the state
from Cornell Cooperative Extension would
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the store, find that there was late
blight there, and suggest to the manager
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to get rid of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened was that some people put
them on sale to move them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of an organic farm not
too far from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there in early August 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had 10 or 11 plantings of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is either the 10th or 11th planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the only planting left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd removed everything else because it
had been affected by late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were going to be destroyed and moved
very quickly because, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are very severely affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that story was repeated many times in
many locations in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a message I got from a lady
growing tomatoes in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, or nearer Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just illustrative of the impact that
this epidemic had.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, I am an organic gardener in
Amsterdam, New York with 63 heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato plants of 23 different varieties
that are all gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing very rare varieties,
black, greens, oranges, whites,
[SPEAKER_01]: all purchased from a very reputable grower
in Schoharie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight I had to leave home as my husband
is pulling and bagging all 63 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 100% loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live on 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I inspect it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems the blight took my plants in
a matter of hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to sell them for additional
income.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always chokes me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was repeated many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question for us was, what was this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the composition of the
pathogen population in 2009?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had received more than 70 samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do several types of assays with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The samples that came from commercial
potatoes were USA, the strain that we'd
[SPEAKER_01]: been seeing for really quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones from tomatoes were something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll illustrate that to you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a protein assay that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons it's so great is we
can do this assay within about two hours
[SPEAKER_01]: and have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a spoiling lesion, we can do
that assay very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, here's the pattern that
we get with US8.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2009, what we got was this pattern,
which is rather different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we also were doing DNA
fingerprinting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this assay takes us four to 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to culture the organism,
get enough DNA to actually do a southern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the DNA fingerprint for the
US8 strain of phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these four columns represent DNA from
four different individuals of phytophthora
[SPEAKER_01]: infestans, which have a different pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one we named US22, because the
terminology had got to that point by this
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the last several years, we've had
various strains of phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: US8 is still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: US20 was dominant in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more recently, US23 and US24 are
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we can identify specific
strains is because of asexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get a clonal lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these can be very,
very dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes sense to understand what
they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to 2009, we know that late blight
was produced in production facilities in
[SPEAKER_01]: both New York and in Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the season, we had
accumulated isolates from other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out the same strain,
US22, was found throughout the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a picture from Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bonnie Plants has a production facility in
Alabama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very clear to me that they
shipped infected plants from their
[SPEAKER_01]: production facility in Alabama to the
production facilities in New York and
[SPEAKER_01]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met with representatives from Bonnie
Plants in November of 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of their responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't ship plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ship plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can somebody tell me what a plug is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've never admitted to doing
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, they haven't been sued.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when talks like mine happened,
they got quite belligerent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were the cause of this huge
pandemic in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have subsequently cleaned up their
act quite considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Zinner is consulting with them and
illustrating how to prevent late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to move on to after 2009 and to
focus on the needed IPM research that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want to do is to focus on a tool
that I think can be really quite useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a decision support system,
which I think will enable integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: management a very effective and efficient
integrated management of late blight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes into account the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And weather is huge in terms of late
blight development.
[SPEAKER_01]: It incorporates cultivar resistance
because there are some cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually at this point immune.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that are quite susceptible
and others that are less susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several forecasting schemes that
have been used in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it contains those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's responsive to pathogen type and also
to fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a tool to enable a grower to take
account all of these factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most interesting things to me
is the location specific weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get weather data from the nearest
weather station to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers have purchased weather
stations so they have on-farm weather
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a transmitted via telephone
actually to Bradfield Hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to getting previous
weather, the weather center here gets
[SPEAKER_01]: weather forecasts for the next seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those weather forecasts are
automatically downloaded to the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weather forecast can be
interpolated on a four kilometer grid so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can have a weather forecast that
is specific within probably two kilometers
[SPEAKER_01]: of you for what the weather might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important because late
blight is very responsive to weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are these two disease forecasting
tools that are present in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a late blight disease simulator on
which one can do experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say a little bit more about the
simulator later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an alert system that can give
you information about what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me talk just a little bit about
pathogen type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned these lineages of phytophthora
infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2009, almost everything we found was U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it was transported on
bonnie plants throughout the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 was also present, but it was present
primarily on commercial potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets transmitted very effectively
on potato tubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010, we had a new lineage that began
to appear primarily in the western part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 began to appear, wasn't real dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 was still present, and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 was present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sample size is typically between
150 and 200 for each of these bar graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2011, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 became more visible and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 became even more visible, whereas U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 became less so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in 2012, this last year, almost
everything we saw was U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is it at all interesting or
important to know what lineage you have or
[SPEAKER_01]: that's near you?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons is that some of these
lineages are sensitive to methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's a figure illustrating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plates are phytophthora
infestans growing on an auger medium with
[SPEAKER_01]: either a zero or five micrograms per mil
or 100 micrograms per mil of methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that there is some effect
of methanoxam on the growth of U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8, but there's still significant growth of
that clonal lineage on methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22, here's growth in the absence of
methanoxam at five micrograms per mil or
[SPEAKER_01]: at 100 micrograms per mil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really severely restricted by
methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put a five millimeter plug on the
plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just about the diameter of the
plug that we put on the plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 is similarly sensitive to methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 is generally sensitive to methanoxam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a methanoxam-sensitive
strain, then you can use that fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be really quite effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also turns out that there's difference
in terms of host preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this slide illustrates is the
amount of sporulations, is how many
[SPEAKER_01]: sporangi are produced on a particular
leaflet for the various clonal lineages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23, and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where the sporulation is on potatoes
or on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this graph illustrates is that U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 is actually a hell of a potato pathogen,
as we already knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't do much at all to tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 does something on potatoes,
but look at what it does on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is an aggressive pathogen and
reproduces very rapidly on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 is even more aggressive on potatoes
than is U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22, and even more aggressive on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 is somewhat similar to U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 in that it's a good pathogen on potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sporulates very profusely on potato,
but almost not at all on tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing tomatoes or are you
growing potatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which pathogen is near you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, you can learn which pathogen
is near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on the eastern part of the United
States, the Extension personnel have
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborated on making reports as to
whether late blight is present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they send those samples to our lab and
we assay those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can identify to clonal lineage very
quickly what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, this is from 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a summary map of the United States
from all of 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, everything we got from
the northeast part of the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: this last summer was U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a really effective pathogen on
both potatoes and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we use now are microsatellite markers
to distinguish the different lineages of
[SPEAKER_01]: phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have data for 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of October 2011, we had
received at least 140 samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd returned around at least 80% of
those within 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the person sending the sample had an
idea of what was present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I think and what we're hoping for
is to develop a strain-specific forecast
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be available on the decision
support system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that will enable people to
become really very knowledgeable about
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cultivar resistance and fungicide are
both huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a picture of some field
experiments looking at cultivars at
[SPEAKER_01]: Freeville.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really a beautiful image,
don't you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian Small took this image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian has been working really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really a gorgeous image.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was there early in the morning
to go fishing because the Fall Creek is
[SPEAKER_01]: right there, and Ian is really an avid
fisherman.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But be that as it may, we have a fair
amount of data about host resistance for
[SPEAKER_01]: both potatoes and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a disease progress curve for a
susceptible cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the y-axis illustrates is the
amount of disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up to 100%, which is all death.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is time along the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see in a susceptible cultivar,
you get this very rapid increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a moderately resistant cultivar,
under the same weather conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same inoculation conditions,
you get much less disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungicides, obviously, are really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: These vertical blue lines illustrate the
dates at which a fungicide was applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a fungicide is applied to a
susceptible cultivar, you can suppress
[SPEAKER_01]: disease quite significantly with
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a moderately resistant cultivar
doesn't need as much fungicide as a
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or put it the other way, a susceptible
cultivar needs a lot more fungicide than
[SPEAKER_01]: does a moderately resistant one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DSS now has cultivars by name,
and they're a category of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least 75 cultivars for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in the process of doing
tomatoes, but there are at least 50
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars of tomatoes that we can put into
the DSS.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of fungicides, there's been also
a tremendous amount of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture from this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The experiment this year had at least 15
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several different combinations
applied to two different tomato cultivars
[SPEAKER_01]: and two different potato cultivars for
something like 70 treatments, which was a
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we used that information to put into
the DSS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to understand this
slide, but it illustrates how we use that
[SPEAKER_01]: information of different fungicides in
terms of a disease forecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a picture of Steve McKay,
who is doing the fungicide applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Steve was driving that tractor about
15 miles an hour between plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boom was bouncing all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Steve, it's my pleasure to recognize
you today for Steve's really significant
[SPEAKER_01]: contribution in terms of all the kinds of
research that goes on out at Freeville.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets the 2011 Excellence in IPM Award.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anything else would be sort of
anti-climactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me, I'll skip this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool, but I'll skip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that with potato late blight
management, I think highly localized
[SPEAKER_01]: management that's really targeted,
it's like personalized medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for your farm, for that field,
for that particular cultivar, will be
[SPEAKER_01]: really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 2013, what we hope to do is to include
sort of a targeted forecast, which also
[SPEAKER_01]: brings into account the pathogen presence
or the lineage that's near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that should be able to really
help out disease management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I'd like to say thanks to
people in my group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Myers, who is right back there,
has done all of the microsats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people all over the East Coast know
Kevin very well, at least electronically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian Small has been doing the work on the
DSS, which is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura Joseph is a programmer who is just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Giovanna Donis is the person who
identified the characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of phytophthora infestans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that, I'll quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are any questions,
I'll give them to Steve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would all love to know the answer to
that question, and we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody wants to know where are these
things coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was present in Florida
prior to 2009, but where it came before it
[SPEAKER_01]: was in Florida, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a twofold answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that in 2009, US 22 was
spread throughout the US on infected
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato transplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as aggressive as US 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing it subside in terms of its
prevalence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both things contribute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Widespread distribution is huge,
but aggressiveness can also make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so US 23 is more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: US 22 is subsiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do when we have infected plants
that we're not worried about, we put them
[SPEAKER_01]: into black garbage bags and let them heat
up during the summer and die that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we can do on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as we know, again, knock on
wood, that we don't think there's sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction yet in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the soil itself is not a
reservoir of this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there are infected tubers or there are
other infected plants somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think OSPORs in the soil are not a
source of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers have used flamethrowers to
destroy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spray a lot of fungicide after they
disk them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want to do is get that plant as
dead as you can as quickly as possible so
[SPEAKER_01]: the pathogen then dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two mating types in phytophthora
and festans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they come physically in contact,
there's sexual reproduction is likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have clonal populations at this
point, even though we have both mating
[SPEAKER_01]: types in the US, we have one clone of one
mating type over there and one clone of a
[SPEAKER_01]: different mating type over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't think they interact that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why we haven't seen
sexual recombination yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although both mating types exist in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is complicated to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the sort of multigenic resistance
that we've been focusing on, we don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: any lineage-specific effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's single R gene resistance,
then yes, there can be quite significant
[SPEAKER_01]: differential effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point, ph2 and ph3 are
resistance genes that seem to be holding
[SPEAKER_01]: up at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a few tomato cultivars with
those resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And against this population of
phytophthora and festans, they are immune.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long we'll have this population of
phytophthora and festans is anybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
