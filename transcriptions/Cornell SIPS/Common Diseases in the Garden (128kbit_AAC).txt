[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to Common Diseases in
the Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just picked up about a dirty dozen or so
of diseases that you're likely to find if
[SPEAKER_00]: you work on the grow line or in your own
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They represent an array of diseases where
some you see the signs of the disease and
[SPEAKER_00]: some you see the symptoms of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just run through them very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're certainly not expected to memorize
them, but just to have a feeling for the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of diseases that you'll find in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first disease I wanted to go over was
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew is one of the easier
diseases to identify because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whitish fuzz which is actually part of the
fungi that covers the leaves, usually on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually a group of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just one specific one,
but they all have specific host ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're ones that hit lilacs,
[SPEAKER_00]: zinnias, dogwoods, roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all susceptible to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have a cool spring and summer,
you're almost assured of seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungal hyphae infect the outermost
leaves and then insert essentially their
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth part as it were, although they don't
have a mouth, but the feeding part into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cells and they feed off of the
photosynthates that the plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, the disease is much more
prevalent when there's periods of high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and rainfall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of a management issue,
you want to keep the foliage as dry as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly if you think that you have a
plant that's likely to get powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say like a bed of zinnias,
try not to overhead water those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to water them so that the leaves don't
get wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, powdery mildew is an
aesthetic issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much a plant health issue,
but it can be quite bad looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that powdery mildew on
dogwoods can go into the stems and cause
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a physiological problem for
dogwoods, but otherwise it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: unsightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you are a small home fruit
grower, specifically apples, you're likely
[SPEAKER_00]: to be dealing with apple scab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly one of the main diseases
that orchardists have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it causes small spots on the leaves,
no big deal, but it also causes spots on
[SPEAKER_00]: the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I recall from my Pathology 101 class
with Dr. Sinclair, who literally wrote the
[SPEAKER_00]: book on diseases, it doesn't affect the
taste of the apple at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a surface thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, if you were looking to buy
an apple that looked like that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you wouldn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes them unsellable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus overwinters on leaves that have
dropped to the ground and hang around and
[SPEAKER_00]: serve as the inoculum source for the next
year's infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole, there's actually
software that's written to help you time,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a professional orchardist,
when you have to spray your plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent apple scab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the home orchardist, especially if
you're starting an orchard, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: great if you can select resistant
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help reduce the amount of
management effort that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have to have good apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have an apple tree already and
you don't want to have apple scab or you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to limit it, there are fungicides
that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, there's not a one size fits
all prescription for fungicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it really depends on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you might want to avail yourself
of some of the Cornell apple scab software
[SPEAKER_00]: programs so that you know when to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be because this is a major
issue for apple growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going right from apples to strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gray mold, botrytis, is like pottery
mildew, there are many botrytis fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all are characterized by having
this sort of gray mold that easily comes
[SPEAKER_00]: off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can see in the picture on the
right, there's two good strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of one on top of the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just to the right of it is a gray
mold effected strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the pattern of spores
have just sort of fallen off and landed on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf to re-infect another part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And botrytis, unfortunately, affects a lot
of different herbaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like pottery mildew, is favored in
cool wet springs and cool summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you'll find that that's true
with all diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hot, dry year might be tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the plants from a water point of view,
but it's much easier on them from a
[SPEAKER_00]: disease point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of diseases are spread by
raindrops hitting the fungus, releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: the spores, and the spores move to a new
part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime we have a cool, wet spring and
a cool and wet-ish summer, look to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, people manage botrytis by
trying to know not to do much overhead
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Mother Nature is going to rain
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're watering on a regular basis,
you'd want to water just the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, not the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tart spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my favorite diseases
because it's pretty hard to misdiagnose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news is, even though this
looks really horrible, it actually has
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much no effect on the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits maples, and it hits the maples in
the late part of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it really doesn't have that
much effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets going, and it can be pretty
amazingly throughout the plant and these
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrant tar-like spots all over the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are actually small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're even the size of a
quarter or larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they hit the plant late in the
growing season, there's really no
[SPEAKER_00]: management, and there's really no real
effect on the tree overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be true for a lot of the
diseases that hit late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it makes the plant unsightly,
but it really doesn't have a physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diseases we worry about are the ones
that hit in the spring, and so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: compromising the plant throughout the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases that hit later in the year that
only hit the tar spot hits and about a
[SPEAKER_00]: month later the leaves are falling off
anyway, it's not really a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one of my favorite diseases is
black knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black knot hits plums, prunes,
and especially cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this sort of charcoal-like
swelling growth on the twigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fungus infects the twigs and then
starts this sort of charcoal-y growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really easy to see when the tree
is out of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually harder to see if you've got
a decent-looking cherry and it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: get black knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not see it until the winter when
the leaves drop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are resistant varieties,
so that would probably be a good idea to
[SPEAKER_00]: do if you know you have a lot of black
knot in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly have seen in New York a lot
more black knot than I see in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: DC area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but we seem to have a
lot of black knot up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can prune out the affected twigs in
the winter, although it might behoove you
[SPEAKER_00]: to dip your pruners in some alcohol
between cuts just to make sure you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be just an aesthetic issue,
but if it gets really going on a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because essentially the growth scrotles
the twig and eventually that twig dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there are enough black knot
infections throughout a cherry,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a plum or a prune, it can kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, always when you're buying new
plants, look for disease-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because diseases are hard to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there's really
management for black knot.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I'm not aware of it, except for
just cutting it out when you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes get a lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them are good, and one of them
is devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three that I wanted to touch on are
early blight, septoria leaf spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting at the top right, that's
septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in my experience, just about
every tomato plant on the lower leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to get septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how you manage the
disease, some people just go in there
[SPEAKER_00]: religiously and strip out the lower leaves
when they start getting septoria to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the infection to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just say, oh, well,
not to worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get my tomatoes, and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to you to decide whether you
want to manage it that way, or if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to spray a fungicide to try to keep
septoria.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems to me that almost every
tomato is going to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are resistant varieties,
but it seems like it's ubiquitous in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also somewhat ubiquitous is early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early blight causes more of a
necrosis, where septoria is spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early blight is more like marginal leaf
necrosis and internecrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be pretty serious and really
keep your tomato harvest much smaller than
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be without the early blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's the devastating late
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And late blight can, ironically,
come somewhat early in the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it tends to be a little bit later in
the season, and it causes these blank,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark cankers on the stems and then hits
the foliage, and it can wipe out the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just 100% dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's pretty much no tolerance for
late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can tolerate septoria and you
can tolerate a little early blight,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really no tolerance for late
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you are 100% vigilant in taking
out and inspecting your plants on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis and removing the one that
starts to have late blight, once late
[SPEAKER_00]: blight gets going, it's going to wipe out
your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list on the Cornell Vegetable
website on varieties that we think are
[SPEAKER_00]: late blight resistant, using fungicides to
keep it at bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly is a bad problem that
comes and goes each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a really bad late blight
season, sometimes it's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because tomatoes are probably our most
important vegetable crop in the home
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, it's important to know these
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly we'll have workshops where
we really take a look at this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to see this up close and
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's talk about diseases where you
see the symptoms, but not the signs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times when people come in and
they show me samples, like on the two
[SPEAKER_00]: leftmost pictures, they're like,
what disease is hitting my plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was really, it was cold injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an abiotic disease, non-living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very hard to diagnose,
partly because a lot, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: evergreens, the damage isn't going to show
up for a month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people, by the time it's 70
degrees, you forget how bad the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: was, or maybe not with this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they forget that these plants,
especially the evergreen plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed all winter long, can get this kind
of damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the right is a picture of a tree,
a thin bark tree, probably of maple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can get a cold injury,
too, called frost cracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, especially on the south side,
where the bark would warm up in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: on a cold but sunny day, and then perhaps
the sun goes behind a cloud, and it's back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very, very cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bark can't expand and contract
that fast, and can cause a frost crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cold injury is something that's subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep kind of an eye on the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a memory in terms of what the cold was
that winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if plants are susceptible
to cold injury, when it's not only cold,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's so frozen that the plants can't
take up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually desiccate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see more like a drying out
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cold injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a year, especially like the one we've
just had, there's a lot of salt on the
[SPEAKER_00]: roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love this picture on the top right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's salt spray damage, where you can
see the yews got hit directly with salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the salt actually desiccates the
needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt is saltier than inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant tries to equivalent the
water potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so water is drawn out of the needles
into the salt around that are coating the
[SPEAKER_00]: needles and kill the plant needle
outright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some browning on the pine
foliage on the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my personal favorite salt damage
is on deciduous trees, which you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: think would have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under heavy, heavy, heavy salt spray
damage, the buds are killed, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the terminal buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're repeatedly killed by the salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant keeps trying to shoot out
new shoots to accommodate the loss of that
[SPEAKER_00]: terminal twig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get this what we call witch's
broom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with salt damage, you can get salt
spray damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get where salt goes into the
soil and makes the roots actually lose
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the roots become less salty than
the soil around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water is drawn out from the root into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot you can do for
salt spray damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know you're going to have salt
damage to the roots, you can leach the
[SPEAKER_00]: excess salt through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt is mobile in the soil, doesn't get
bound up in the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually we don't have to worry about it
too much because usually a winter,
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh winter, is followed by a bunch of
spring rains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those rains flush the salt through the
soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you dumped a bag of de-icing salts
on one of your favorite plants by mistake,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can obviously try to remove as much
salt as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then flush it out in the spring with
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep watering that plant in the early
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the soil salts will move
through the soil profile and away from
[SPEAKER_00]: your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bossamendron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bossamendron is a tomato disease where,
and sometimes pepper, where you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: lesion or sort of a, yeah, kind of a mushy
black lesion on the one side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, on the end of the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a calcium uptake
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, where most of the disease
for tomatoes are worse when it's wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a disease that's worse when it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the tomato is rapidly expanding,
it needs calcium as one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the plant is growing, if it doesn't
get enough calcium, it has problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can't, especially if it's dry,
it just can't get enough calcium up into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and you start getting problems
like Bossamendron.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tolerant varieties, so you may
want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In somewhat rainy New York, we don't seem
to have it so badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just be careful if you, we are having
a dry summer to make sure your tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: are well irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll help keep calcium uptake going
so you won't have the Bossamendron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium wilt affects some of our most
beloved plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be particularly harsh on
Japanese maples and on red bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it hits a number of plants,
certainly all the maple species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in the upper left-hand
corner, there's some Japanese maples and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just really thinning out,
looking unthrifty, not very good
[SPEAKER_00]: aesthetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the bottom picture is a maple
with some branch dieback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, again, is probably verticillium
wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit hard to diagnose
sometimes because it's sort of a fading
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium often hits one branch at a
time, so that can be a clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you snip that branch off and you
peel away the bark, in the upper right
[SPEAKER_00]: corner you can see some brown streaking in
the cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it to be quite subtle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is diagnostic for verticillium,
the brown streaking in the cambium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no spray for verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soil-borne pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things you would want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can remove the affected parts and hope
that, you know, that contains it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that basically you start just
removing the plant on the installment
[SPEAKER_00]: plant plan where you take off one branch
and next year take off another branch,
[SPEAKER_00]: next year take off another branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly if that tree dies, you would
want to plant resistant species back into
[SPEAKER_00]: that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's soil-borne, it persists in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't want to put another maple,
like you wouldn't want to replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese maple that died of verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with another maple, you might want to
put, you know, there are a lot of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are resistant to verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would want to use those rather than
susceptible diseases, susceptible species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well that is the, a quick overview
of some of the most common diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see in central New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And happy disease hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
