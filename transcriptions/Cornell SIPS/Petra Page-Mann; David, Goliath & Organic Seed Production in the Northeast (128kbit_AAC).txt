[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is such a privilege and pleasure to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you all for making this time in
your busy schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first and foremost, I have some
questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you like to grow things?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have saved seed before?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have developed brand new
varieties of vegetables?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you know the story of David
and Goliath?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of you woke up this morning,
put on clothes, and ate something for
[SPEAKER_01]: breakfast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good news is we have a lot in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all play a larger role in our food
system, in our seed system today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the world that we're building for our
great, great grandchildren as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps more than you realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you've never developed a brand
new variety of vegetable, if you've saved
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds of vegetables, of flowers,
of herbs, you've made subtle shifts in
[SPEAKER_01]: that variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really all that a plant breeder
is doing, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense, Michael.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's some more methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are certainly lots of intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time someone asks you, you've
developed new varieties that have forever
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the genetics available to people
on this planet, if you have saved seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: confidently raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you've never sown a seed in
your life, every day you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day you put on clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every day you are determining the
plants that are being bred by those
[SPEAKER_01]: professional plant breeders all around the
country and all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you never sow a seed,
your life every day impacts the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: being bred and sown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the world that are changing the
world for our grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David and Goliath is a story that I
thought I knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out I didn't know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of my story today is sharing with
you one of my favorite stories,
[SPEAKER_01]: retold.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Petra, Petra Page Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up here in the Finger Lakes
saving seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the core of my passion,
my motivation that brings me here today
[SPEAKER_01]: and to my fields every day that I'm so
fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2012, I started a seed company with my
beloved partner, Matthew Goldfarb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited to grow seeds,
organic seeds that are really adapted for
[SPEAKER_01]: this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've traveled all around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that I can see that even
between here in Ithaca, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of oaks than there are in
Naples on my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say nothing of the oaks that are in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say nothing of the oaks that are in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe that seed can be that
resilient as well if we choose to select
[SPEAKER_01]: it so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, I left my clicker
over yonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to start with what is a seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a seed, I'm doing a lot of moving
around today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A seed is a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a living, breathing being just like
you and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this particular seed is a
Haudenosaunee skunk bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Haudenosaunee people, does anyone
recognize that name?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Iroquois people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iroquois vaguely sounds French.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, Iroquois was the French
derogatory term for our indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this bean has been grown in the valley
where I grew this bean for over 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without question, it is the most
disease resistant, it's the quickest
[SPEAKER_01]: maturing, and we harvest twice the yield
of any other whole dry bean I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which perhaps isn't saying that much
because I'm a little girl and I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: an extensive trialing system, but I've
grown a lot of dry beans in my day and
[SPEAKER_01]: this bean friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to imagine that there's something
to the fact that it's been growing in our
[SPEAKER_01]: soils, been adapting with our climate,
been adapting with our ancestors as all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these variables have changed over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is such a profoundly regionally
adapted variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sends shivers down my spine in the
same way that we have ancestors and that
[SPEAKER_01]: we may become ancestors.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds may too become ancestors as
all of the ancestors countless that have
[SPEAKER_01]: come before them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part one, the magic of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeds are domesticated plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around, we've been
domesticating plants, give or take 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love every time I see the image of
teosinte, it sends shivers down my spine
[SPEAKER_01]: again because I would have just mowed it
if it was in my lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ancestors that knew nothing about DNA
have been selecting this grass for
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's grown over millions of acres
on every continent except Antarctica and
[SPEAKER_01]: feeds outrageous percentage of our global
population every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to imagine that those same
people in the Andes thousands of years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, if I had asked them, have you ever
developed a brand new variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable?
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably would have not raised their
hands as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably all of us in this room today have
already eaten corn at some point in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last day if not week, multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ancestors have impacted our lives in
unfathomable ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, when you save seeds, this is the
impact that you may have on countless
[SPEAKER_01]: generations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we reap what we sow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, does anyone recognize what the
seed head might be?
[SPEAKER_01]: P.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is carrot, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so same genus species as Queen Anne's
Lace, which is the reason we put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: isolation cages at our farm and then still
are nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we reap what we sow in that these
seeds that we can save and pass on
[SPEAKER_01]: generation after generation, we've lost
over 80% of the genetic diversity that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've cultivated as a species in the last
10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, the percentage is always
changing and I can't quite keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something around 60% of all the seeds,
all the genetic diversity on this planet
[SPEAKER_01]: is controlled by three and now quickly two
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ludicrous, this precipice that we
find ourselves on as seed has gone from
[SPEAKER_01]: this commons, this I can't imagine selling
you water or selling you the air that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't quite imagine selling you the
seed packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm not selling you the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling you a really beautiful packet
with some nice information and a website
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can learn how to grow them
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I tell myself anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There happens to be seeds inside too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as seed has moved from a commons to a
commodity and our food system has become
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly globalized, our seed system
has dramatically changed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day I was sharing this
extraordinary darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I feel around our food system and our
seed system with my dear friend Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: McDormand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps some of you know Bill
McDormand.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's this crafty wizard poet of a seed
saver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, as I'm telling him this despair,
he shared with me this quote, which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to share with you before we delve
into some other stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he smiled at me as I'm like on the
verge of tears reaching for my hanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm sharing with him the sadness
that I feel and he said, well Petra,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me tell you, you have forgotten
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in a single generation we have
lost untold wisdom around our genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've forgotten that there's infinite
potential in a handful of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because each seed is infinitely
replicable, incredibly adaptable,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll break that down for 45 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each seed is infinitely replicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that seed that I'm passing around
that hadanashani skunk bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted one of those the first week in
June.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that single seed I'll harvest
thousands, probably at least a thousand if
[SPEAKER_01]: not 2,000 seeds from that single plant by
fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: With things like amaranth, there'll be
tens of thousands of seeds from that one
[SPEAKER_01]: single seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely am focused on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a mathematician.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have one thing that can make
10,000 things, and each of those 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: things can make another 10,000 things,
all of a sudden I hope that you're hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you have friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you also see that this is
a reason to have hope for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each seed is incredibly adaptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a photograph of kale overwintering
on our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year we overwinter lots of
things on our farm and other collaborator
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers here in the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants can adapt to whatever our
imaginations might contrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's shipping tomatoes from San
Diego to Maine in February or asking
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuce to overwinter uncovered in the
Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our imagination is the limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love remembering that even if we lose
100% of the genetic diversity that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated as a species for 10,000 years,
we live on the greenest planet that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can start again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have to mention in such astute
community that there's probably way more
[SPEAKER_01]: spores in this picture than seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to share this little sentiment
before I move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Pancho and Davi, by the way,
our little dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Davi is named for David and Goliath,
which I'm excited to share with you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me all the time why I love
saving seeds and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think it's about building
community and eating good food,
[SPEAKER_01]: but selecting seeds, not just saving
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in those lettuce,
not that bolt first and not the die over
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter, but the ones that bolt last
and survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with those seeds, I tuck them in the
ground and tuck them in packets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love for you all to take a packet
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a good number of packets in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you all take them home and know
that if you'd like to keep in touch,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can also sign up on our email sheet as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a monthly organic gardening
newsletter that's very entertaining as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as informative from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh yeah, because so selecting seed is
important because, oh yeah, you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in a flavor or a disease
resistance or yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of really valid interests
that you can select your seeds for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to, I remind myself all the
time that I do this joyfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there may be a time that we do this
out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time might in fact be now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dear friend Dan Bresbois up in Montreal
has an organic seed farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three years ago when he was starting
his greenhouses, he was paddling through
[SPEAKER_01]: his greenhouses as we were starting ours
here in the Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a hundred year flood of the
St. Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the third hundred year flood
in five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very humbling reminder for me
that if I, that I want to do this work
[SPEAKER_01]: joyfully first and foremost, but that out
of necessity, our climates are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our markets are shifting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if decentralization is becoming a
necessity that needs to start at the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So David and Goliath, first let me
introduce my partner, Matthew Goldfarb
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading cover crop seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so David and Goliath is a story that I
thought I knew all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been rooting for the underdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always thought that the
improbable was probably possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't until a few years ago and
Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book about David
[SPEAKER_01]: and Goliath that I realized that,
oh, I didn't know this story in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been a huge inspiration for me,
this retelling of David and Goliath in
[SPEAKER_01]: starting a seed company here in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because P.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, you don't grow seed here in
the Northeast, Petra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent years growing seed where seed is
grown in the world in the Pacific
[SPEAKER_01]: Northwest where it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't rain from the beginning of May
till the end of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seed, yeah, there's all these
great reasons why you don't grow seed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Petra, why are you starting a seed
company in the Northeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you this story about David and
Goliath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 3,000 years ago, the Philsteins and the
Israelites were having a disagreement as
[SPEAKER_01]: they had had before and they had had
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was one in a long line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in ancient warfare, there was this
thing, single combat, which was really
[SPEAKER_01]: convenient because if you have two armies
and they go at each other, a lot of life
[SPEAKER_01]: can be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you choose your one single warrior,
and from one side and the other side
[SPEAKER_01]: chooses their one single warrior,
maybe we can be a tiny bit more civilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Philsteins send down this massive
warrior, their finest warrior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's literally a giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's covered in head to toe with
gleaming armor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has not only a sword, he's
brandishing a javelin and a spear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's pretty formidable.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the specter of dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Israelites, our little quaking in
their boots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And King Saul is looking through his army
and trying to decide who could he possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: send to defeat this undefeatable giant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The giant's name, by the way, was Goliath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one's stepping forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: King Saul doesn't want to tap anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this little shepherd steps up.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name happens to be David.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shepherd says, well, you know,
I've been fending off lions and wolves in
[SPEAKER_01]: my flock for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And King Saul says, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here in the Bible, I'm laughing at
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes to take off his armor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The king of the Israelites takes off his
own armor to send the shepherd boy to
[SPEAKER_01]: battle with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David says, no, I really don't need
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do need some stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he leans down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he brings five stones from the valley
floor with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes to meet Goliath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slingers were a thing 3,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, slingshots are children's toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these people could swing stones,
like 45 millimeter handguns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can see where this story
is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: David just walks up to this giant far
enough away so that Goliath has no chance
[SPEAKER_01]: to use his well-honed, beautiful gleaming
tools, weapons against him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just shoots a stone right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Goliath is down on the ground,
waning consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: David walks up, takes Goliath's own sword,
and leans down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lops off his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why we all know a different story,
why we all think it was surprising that
[SPEAKER_01]: David won is a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the piece today that I want to share
with you all that I love remembering
[SPEAKER_01]: because I forget all the time is that
advantages are not always advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And disadvantages are not always
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the underdog knows the tool,
the rules in his pocket, when the underdog
[SPEAKER_01]: is on his own turf, when he's confident,
and when he refuses to play by the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: of the dominant paradigm, the underdog
wins every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malcolm Gladwell's book beautifully
portrays this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Goliath didn't have a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does this relate to the seed
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Goliath of this industrial,
global economy seed food system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty formidable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The branding, we can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People buy things, buy their products just
because on reputation, and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: around for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these international markets,
they're so significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the profit centers that they have
nailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, it's incredibly challenging
to see how we can possibly beat and begin
[SPEAKER_01]: to create a different paradigm and take
down this incredible Goliath of a food
[SPEAKER_01]: system that is serving some people,
but who is really being served by this
[SPEAKER_01]: food system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have David.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my little friend in a field of
kale in Trumanburg and surrounded by four
[SPEAKER_01]: acres of kale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's the thing about seed in the
Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on our own turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saving seeds in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one is doing this work unless we do
this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to play by the same
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make up our own rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make up our own vision of branding,
our own vision of all of these tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: have and we don't have to throw the baby
out with the bath water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of babies and there's a lot
of bath water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another thing that is really critical
is David knew how to wield his tools well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we might have some significant
constraints here in the Northeast for
[SPEAKER_01]: creating quality seed, but we have some
great tools, whether it's timing,
[SPEAKER_01]: when do you plant things, when you harvest
things, whether it's using things like
[SPEAKER_01]: root cellars or high tunnels, leveraging
other kinds of resources in our
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and just looking at it not
only as what can we do on our farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how can we collaborate with other
farmers, with our local universities,
[SPEAKER_01]: with whether it's food banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many tools that we have in
our toolbox and the creative piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking outside the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so many reasons why seed is,
yes, there are certainly constraints to
[SPEAKER_01]: competing at that global economic scale,
growing seed here in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm incredibly excited to be
constantly learning more every day and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding more people excited to do this
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other thing too about David
and Goliath and you and I and the world
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're living in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our saving for our grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goliath was chosen by the Philistines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Goliath personally,
but I suspect he was this warrior that had
[SPEAKER_01]: been preened and groomed as this warrior
from inside for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had all of these resources to
buffer him from the world around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where David was in fact not selected by
King Saul.
[SPEAKER_01]: King Saul laughed at him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He chose himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he stood up and said, I can make a
difference and let me give it a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing is, who is the king now
that's making this industrialized global
[SPEAKER_01]: food system Goliath?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we all are.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ways that we spend money and the
ways we spend our time, even if we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: overtly want to be supporting these
systems, we all in little ways and an
[SPEAKER_01]: often not little ways are part of what is
perpetuating this paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that means we all can be David and
we all are David should we choose to stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up and do what we love to wield our tools
well and to have skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, this is that same field of kale a
month later with Dandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that same little girl's hands
going through 450 pounds of kale seed a
[SPEAKER_01]: few days after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'd like to share some stories of
different collaborations here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Finger Lakes that I'm really excited about
because seed in the Northeast isn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: seed in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is engaging all of these different
stakeholders and the food system and well
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I have put in a big
enough plug yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to cut myself off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at one of the most amazing
universities on the planet and you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: public plant breeding program that has
changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: profoundly and has changed this world
profoundly in the last 150 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so thrilled that you all are a
part of this wonderful institution and
[SPEAKER_01]: never underestimate the Davids that you
already are in creating this new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a special heads off to Michael
Mizarek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am at your service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is true for you all as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little story about a purple
cone headed cabbage that is an heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: variety that Robin at Blue Heron Farm in
Lodi absolutely loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she and Lou grew this cabbage for
almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they personally witnessed the
degradation of this fantastic variety
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, it has, it's a beautiful
cone head dense super tender, incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet and flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we first met them four years ago,
less than 10% of the heads were still
[SPEAKER_01]: conical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see some of them were these
tiny little heads on these great big
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some were just regular, you know,
round heads and some were very loose heads
[SPEAKER_01]: where others were dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few of them were actually cone headed
and actually dense and nice compact
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grow, but they continued to grow
it out several thousand plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: because they love them and they could
market them regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the five, 8% that was actually doing
what they wanted to, that was just the
[SPEAKER_01]: cream on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went in and put in lots of flags and
we actually saved, saved plants from that
[SPEAKER_01]: first generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 55 plants out of almost 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually had all of the qualities
that we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, and we, they were able to
actually cut off the heads, market the
[SPEAKER_01]: heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have any loss as a market
gardener growing this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we lifted the roots and stems and
all, brought them to our root cellar and
[SPEAKER_01]: planted them out the following spring and
saved the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, that next generation,
it was around 65, 70% were good heads and
[SPEAKER_01]: that next generation is now being
germination tested as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what it looks like now,
but this is a great example of how,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these amazing market farmers,
market growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would love to have an R and D
department and have more extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: trialing at fruition seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in lieu of that, we have so many
phenomenal farmers here in the Finger
[SPEAKER_01]: Lakes that have extraordinary observations
that they've made over decades and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And collaborating with them has been such
a privilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another marvelous land-grant
university, University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Wisconsin-Madison has the open source seed
initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited to collaborate
with Irwin and Claire and they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as well as Nathaniel Thompson at
Remembrance Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so selecting something that is a
Bolero, the next generation that is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a certified organic variety and
is going to be an OP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at the time and want to
share all these other little stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't want to go in too deeply,
but we can talk about these things in a
[SPEAKER_01]: few minutes, if you would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But know that there's lots of amazing ways
that universities and farmers and lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: other players in the food system game are
playing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final piece that I wanted to share
is this lovely little Cusa-style summer
[SPEAKER_01]: squash that's very delicious, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exciting part that I want to share
with you is that we've created dozens and
[SPEAKER_01]: dozens and dozens of pounds of seed that
have no place in a seed packet,
[SPEAKER_01]: no place going into the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally in new variety development,
there's just a lot of byproduct,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's delicious food or seed that
in fact has enormous nutritive potential
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the process of creating a brand
new open pollinated variety from an F1,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have collaborated with Stony Brook in
Geneva, and they are this, have any of you
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of them or tasted their good things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are so outrageously divine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, so they're toasting these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are pressing them for oil,
and then marvelous and visionary chefs are
[SPEAKER_01]: putting them on their table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking this waste stream and turning it
into a revenue stream that is not only a
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue stream, but it's really genuinely
feeding people and nourishing people has
[SPEAKER_01]: been one of my favorite little nuances of
some of our collaborations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanted to share this quick little
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often grow lots of winter squash and
sometimes it's a lot of winter squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I go, when I do things,
I tend to really do things for better and
[SPEAKER_01]: for worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first year we grew 7,000 pounds of
winter squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do with 7,000 pounds of winter
squash when you just need the certified
[SPEAKER_01]: organic seed inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we collaborated with Foodlink up in
Rochester and they drove a tractor trailer
[SPEAKER_01]: down to our farm in Naples and brought all
of this various and sundried deliciousness
[SPEAKER_01]: up to their state of the art kitchen in
Rochester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we developed this whole protocol with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they saved the seed right on site and
gave us back 80 pounds of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kept the rest of the winter
squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Foodlink, Foodlink up in Rochester.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a phenomenal, they serve 10
counties and they're definitely a model
[SPEAKER_01]: food bank for the country and for the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to... So Peace Work is a
marvelous pepper that is a project that
[SPEAKER_01]: was a farmer led breeding development
project, but Cornell very much facilitated
[SPEAKER_01]: it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are so many other things I
wanted to share about this, but I am not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leave this as an earmark and perhaps we
can pick up this conversation at another
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'd like to finish with this
slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years ago, I was invited to save
seed in the Dominican Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken for granted my entire life that
I have access to seeds, to any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed that I could possibly want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they're organic or not,
whether they're heirloom, whether F1,
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of seed in the world I have
access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Dominican Republic, Syngenta owns
the rights exclusively to important seed
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anytime you want to buy a seed in
the DR, you're buying any one of that one
[SPEAKER_01]: variety that's available from this one
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're ludicrously expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really exciting to me that
they're saving seeds and sharing seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: building this incredible seed system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's not illegal for them to save
seed and that's not even illegal for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell the seed that they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can't import it and then sell
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which brings me to the thought that you
have seed packets in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so grateful you're going home with
some of my little babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people ask me if I have children,
I say, yes, I have great, great,
[SPEAKER_01]: great grandchildren, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so glad you're bringing some of
them home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an act of faith to plant a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an act of faith to buy a seed
packet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you have planted something and
it's not actually what it was in the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: packet?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fruition seeds is part of that lovely
legacy, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an act of faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just going on faith that whatever
it says on the seed packet is what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the questions that you're
asking your seed companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the questions you're asking
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the world that you're wanting to
grow and build for your great,
[SPEAKER_01]: great grandchildren?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are your seed companies actually
living into those values?
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more questions you ask,
the more opportunities it gives the Davids
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world to do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really thrilled to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've listened to myself talk way too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm clearly capable of monologues,
but I'm really excited to have a dialogue
[SPEAKER_01]: with you all now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so please, by all means, keep in
touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find all of our contact info on
that seed packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow us on Instagram and
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you all come to visit our
farm in Naples as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're an hour and a half west.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd love to know if there's anything
on your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have about 13 minutes, so we can
have a dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might start by asking Geneva,
which is not visible, but behind that
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, if they have any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva, do you have any questions for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crocodiles in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your wonderful talk,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always hear that, again, that you said
you can't grow seeds in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And disease is our issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you get around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we produce healthy seeds that don't
have diseases on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve's question was, how do we produce
healthy, disease-free seed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is many-fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly the answer of just don't
grow spinach here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain things that I humbly
have learned that there's just a reason
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not grown here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vast majority of crops,
I really believe that we can grow here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether it's growing things in high
tunnels or just shifting the season a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, planting schedules a little
differently, or things like hot water
[SPEAKER_01]: baths.
[SPEAKER_01]: With tomatoes, early blight is seed-borne.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we hot water bath any of our tomato
seed that has come from early blight
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certainly, there are so many
things that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it takes a village.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having resources like Chris Smart here
at Cornell, I am a little embarrassed how
[SPEAKER_01]: often I email Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't pretend to have all the
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I suspect that there's,
as soon as there's something I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, OK, who do I know that might
have some insight?
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's Chris Smart here at
Cornell or sending photos to John Navasio,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of people have lots of great insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been really fortunate at
fruition to not have significant disease
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, which I wonder, too, is partially
a scale thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing acres and acres and
acres, hundreds of acres of X,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have limited genetic diversity,
especially if you're perhaps creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid with two very inbred parent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some susceptibility that
you may not have in a smaller,
[SPEAKER_01]: more diverse context.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then on the other side of the coin,
that smaller, more diverse context opens
[SPEAKER_01]: you up to further disease issues
potentially as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been really fortunate slash have
learned a lot about what to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: what not to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do have disease, how to
identify it and what to do next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don?
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick, can you go back one slide?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell that story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Mazurek is the beginning of many
of our stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we started Fruition Seeds and met
Michael, he was like, hey, you guys want
[SPEAKER_01]: some watermelon?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, oh, we'd love some
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gives us 16 different packets that
are all different lines from this initial
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the F3 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really fun to grow watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never seen the diversity potential
in watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I never realized that you can have
really sweet watermelon that doesn't taste
[SPEAKER_01]: like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have watermelon that
tastes so much like watermelon,
[SPEAKER_01]: but isn't even sweet and everywhere in
between and super thick rinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some have huge seeds and some of small
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some are more fibrous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, of course, mature earlier than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, some of them have more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really fun to see all of that
diversity in those initial parent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've just been playing with them
ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very just phenotypically saying,
wow, I think you're beautiful and
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, you're productive and early
maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to save your seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a number of different lines
that we've just been chasing for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this last year, we've been kind of
eyeing these two as our up and coming new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided to call it August Ambrosia
is a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're releasing this next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from that initial cross that Michael
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's between three, four, and like
six, seven pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This small ovular, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a color.
[SPEAKER_01]: A skin coloration I've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lime green with a silver lattice over
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in this season, we were eating
watermelon the first week in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pardon me, in August, which kind of blew
my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I would have been like,
yeah, it's near a show off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had the year to do it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year, I'm genuinely bowled over
that there was a watermelon that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: eating the first week in August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a nice thin rind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are really small and are
delightful to crunch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a wonderful party.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of wonderful parties,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we have all this watermelon and
we just need the seeds, I hope you come
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy our byproduct with us and just eat
watermelon all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a couple hundred people come
to the farm and wander around spitting
[SPEAKER_01]: watermelon seeds in our dollyets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we asked everybody to name it as well,
which was incredibly fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the grand prize was, oh, you named a
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got all of these wonderful
submissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that we liked, there was one
that was August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually forget what the second word
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was like, August, I like where
you're going with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our, we have five farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our five farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call Ambrosia, which is another
wonderful story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been one of our isolations for
this watermelon for the last three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to call it August Ambrosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know what else you have to
say, except that you'll find it at
[SPEAKER_01]: fruitionseeds.com, as well as at Green
Star, you'll find our seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at Green Tree, at Home Green Home,
and at the Agway, we'll probably have our
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find August Ambrosia,
as well as lots of other great Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, like Honey Nut Squash,
and Habanada, and Success PM, and Silver
[SPEAKER_01]: Slicer Cucumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get enough of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fruitionseeds offers a lot of marvelous
Cornell varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a privilege to have a local
land-grant university dedicated to public
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding right in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to play this tiny, tiny role in giving
access to people, to these amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions?
If not, Petra, we are so grateful for
sharing your stories about fruition and
[SPEAKER_00]: being that wonderful David.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Don.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
