[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Alejandra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here in the frozen north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's talk is going to be in two
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first part is about the topic
that's in the title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part is related to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really about a recent research
project that I've started working on with
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard Barclay, who's somebody who did a
postdoc with me and has stayed on at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Smithsonian to do this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll see how they're
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope it doesn't come across as two
disjointed things, because they really are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty firmly connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a common graph that a lot of
people see in an intro geology class or
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth history class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the temperature history
of the last 65 million years or so as
[SPEAKER_00]: reconstructed from oxygen isotope
measurements of 4 amps collected mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: through deep sea coring programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give popular talks, so I converted
this temperature scale to Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it confuses me when I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I won't apologize for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's global mean temperature today,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is this temperature record.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the first thing that pops
out at anybody is that most of the last 65
[SPEAKER_00]: million years have been a lot warmer than
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of a period of
interglacial fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, of course, are in a period of
rapid global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that Earth historians can do
and that paleobotanists can do is try to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a better understanding of the warm
climates of the past as a way of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help understand what might be happening in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my research in the last 25
years has focused on a particular very
[SPEAKER_00]: short interval of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this spike here is an event called the
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always curious, how many people in
this room have heard of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some, but not all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a geology department,
everybody's heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and
doesn't want to hear any more about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they feel like it's been
overexposed or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to see that this audience is
a little more mixed in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the defining features of this very
short-term warming event are that we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: global excursion, as it's called,
in the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that in these little 4M shells
from the bottom of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in organic matter in terrestrial
fossil soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in the teeth of fossil mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in soil nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been picked up around the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a rather major change,
considering that it's global, of about
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five per mil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one indication of a rather rapid
release of a lot of carbon into the ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it shows up in so many
different places, from the deep sea to the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of continents, it's obvious that
this carbon release has been mixed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere and the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, there's global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was first detected in the
oxygenized taupe composition of these same
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of little 4Ms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the global warming is about five to
eight degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be about the same amount of
warming from all the way from the poles to
[SPEAKER_00]: the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't look as if the warming is
happening locally or regionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really truly global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that kind of warming is
consistent with a big release of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, the third point here,
there's extensive dissolution of carbonate
[SPEAKER_00]: in the marine realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So particularly in the deep marine,
at the bottom of the ocean, there's a clay
[SPEAKER_00]: interval, a period of time during which
deep sea sediments basically don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any carbonate in them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That carbonate dissolution event is
another thing that's consistent with the
[SPEAKER_00]: release of a lot of carbon because you
would expect that to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: solubility of carbonate in seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you should get a dissolution
interval if there was a big carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: This event lasted about 200,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the warming and the changes
in ocean chemistry, it's generally thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is about the best analog we have
in the geologic record for what humans are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interval has attracted a lot of
interest in the geological sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably wondering where the carbon
came from because that's the first
[SPEAKER_00]: question that people ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that there are no factories to
produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is that after 25 years of
working on the event, we still really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know where the carbon came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increasingly, it looks as if the
reason that it's been hard to figure it
[SPEAKER_00]: out is because it's coming from multiple
reservoirs of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a period when there's a whole lot
of volcanic activity in the North
[SPEAKER_00]: Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The North Atlantic is rifting open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sediments that had been deposited
in the North Atlantic over a period of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: million years were full of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where North Sea oil comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the reason why Norway and Britain are
such major oil producing nations today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the volcanism is intruding sills and
dikes into these marine sediments and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably generating a lot of carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consequence, it looks as if at some
point, the warming that's the result of
[SPEAKER_00]: this volcanogenic carbon is causing the
release of methane hydrate deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are deposits in the ocean floor that
are sort of in an ice-like state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is ice you can burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this carbon has an extraordinary
extremely light isotopic composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shift in carbon isotope
composition that we see turns out to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: very useful marker for the event,
but is also one of the signs that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of carbon being released.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big change in the isotopic
composition of carbon on the surface of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little hard to figure out how you
could get such a big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But methane hydrate deposits have a carbon
isotope composition of about minus 60 per
[SPEAKER_00]: mil in the standard delta notation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, like a land plant, is minus 27
or minus 28 on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this very light carbon is being
released at some point probably as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result of warming that's initiated by the
volcanogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also possible that there may be
carbon coming from permafrost or from
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of either oxidation or
wildfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a complicated event with probably
multiple, perhaps, sort of positive
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback loops that are being generated by
warming that initially comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: volcanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to show, sort of give you
a sense of what the planet looks like at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time 56 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an Arctic Ocean that's completely
open, no ice there, no land ice in the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the rifting is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of flood basalts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to sort of focus in on this
area in Wyoming in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map giving you a sense of where
we have information about this
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum event on
either in shallow marine sections here and
[SPEAKER_00]: here that record in pollen diagrams the
shift across the boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in a few places in Western North
America, we have information that's from
[SPEAKER_00]: outcrops that are actually exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the primary one is here in Wyoming in
a place called the Bighorn Basin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where I've done most of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very fortuitous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mountains are rising around this
intermontane basin from starting about
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 63 or 64 million years ago and
going right through the Paleocene-Eocene
[SPEAKER_00]: interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, these were weathering off
at the time and streams were coming down
[SPEAKER_00]: into this subsiding intermontane basin and
depositing fluvial sediments, which were
[SPEAKER_00]: then being modified by soil forming
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red stripes you're seeing here are
fossilized soil deposits formed on those
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient flood plains 56 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this very bright red stripe that you
see here is actually the Paleocene-Eocene
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal maximum or part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that that stripe is so thick
and so red reflects an increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: weathering rates on land at the same time,
almost certainly in response to increased
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and precipitation in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that carbon isotope
excursion in part because not only is it
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the signals that we had a carbon
release, but it's also a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: tool in correlating from the deep sea
where we're able to observe changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean chemistry and marine systems and the
terrestrial systems that I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also gives us a way of sort of
tracking changes in the carbon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are results from a paper that
came out a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the opportunity to drill cores in
the Bighorn Basin through this time
[SPEAKER_00]: interval, which is something that's not
often done in continental settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave us two long records through
the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum at a
[SPEAKER_00]: place called Polecat Bench, which had been
investigated over many years, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: vertebrate fossils and also changes in
soils and other features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this core allowed us to do was to
sample essentially centimeter by
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter up through time, looking at
carbonate nodules that form in these
[SPEAKER_00]: ancient soil horizons and getting carbon
isotope values from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give us this very, very sharp,
this is just a few meters of sediment
[SPEAKER_00]: here, a couple of paleocene soil horizons,
showing this rapid, rapid decrease in the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon isotope composition of the soil
nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a period of relatively stable but
much lower isotopic composition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a recovery interval here as the
carbon isotope composition of the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: nodules increases again back toward the
level that it had before the event
[SPEAKER_00]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this is, we think,
recording the release of this isotopically
[SPEAKER_00]: very light carbon from the methane hydrate
deposits or other sources of light carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that's, just to give you a
sense of what that actually looks like in
[SPEAKER_00]: an outcrop, and I realize now this
probably you haven't spent decades going
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same place, or at least not to this
same place, which I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I know what the scale of this
is, but there's nobody standing in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just, each one of these layers
here, each one of these is a fossil soil
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a few meters of sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the paleocene here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before the isotope excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The isotope excursion starts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you get up to this soil
horizon, you're already in what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: the body of the carbon isotope excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really, really rapid event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sedimentation rates here are a meter
of sediment represents maybe 2,000 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 3,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about a very rapid
release of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has actually been one of the
things that we've been working on pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: hard is trying to understand just how
rapid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from a paper last year where
we've been able to correlate using the
[SPEAKER_00]: shape of the carbon isotope excursion,
we've been able to correlate from this
[SPEAKER_00]: terrestrial core to marine cores through
the same time interval that have a cyclic
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern of change in the iron content of
the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cyclic pattern is also seen in
the cores on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cyclic pattern is generated by
Milankovitch cyclicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got basically a metronome that
gives us these 20,000, 21,000 year cycles,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are grouped together at 100,000 year
cycles that are controlled by the
[SPEAKER_00]: eccentricity of the Earth's orbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see those cycles in the
terrestrial realm, and you can see them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the marine realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can sort of combine that
information and conclude that this onset
[SPEAKER_00]: event is less than 5,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's geologically pretty close to what
we would call instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as fast as the human addition of
carbon to the atmosphere today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe 10 times slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still by far the fastest event of
this type we know of in the geological
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has just made the event that much
more interesting to study, is to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not a perfect analog for the
future, but it looks better and better as
[SPEAKER_00]: we get to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of a local practical
significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is now we're heavily into the geology
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can detect, as I said,
you can detect that carbon isotope
[SPEAKER_00]: excursion in these soil nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also just grind up a piece of rock
and get the isotopic composition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersed organic material in that rock,
because these are paleosols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you can find this
carbon isotope excursion lots of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The badlands I showed you, there are
places where every hill actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: record of this event somewhere on that
hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know where to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carbon isotope excursion has
something that we've, and this is a panel
[SPEAKER_00]: section across about 20 miles of badland
topography, where we've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: locate where on a lot of hillsides the
carbon isotope excursion is, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can go out there and start
digging holes looking for plant fossils,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where my primary research
interest is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just made a little montage here of
the process, since it may be that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't had the life-transforming
experience of collecting plant fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have, but you should be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like your first, I'll just
try heroin just once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to be careful about this,
because if you do it, you might decide
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's so much fun, you just have to
keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are badlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is not that there's no
place to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is you can look anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to figure out where there
actually are plant fossils in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't weather out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone, if you're a paleontologist,
everyone says, oh, you must go collect
[SPEAKER_00]: dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't collect dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dinosaurs, you might be able to find a
dinosaur, because it would be weathering
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the side of the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the kind of plant fossils I find do
not weather out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just turn to dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to really find them is to
go dig a hole with a shovel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your shovel is basically your eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hills look different if you look
at them for long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I dig a lot of little holes looking
for a place that looks like the rock might
[SPEAKER_00]: have preserved organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you find organic matter,
you might dig a slightly larger hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's some indication of leaf
fossils or other kinds of plant fossils,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might get your friends to come help
you and dig a bigger hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can end up, if in a really
good spot, you can dig really big holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my proudest accomplishment of my
career, because if you know what year to
[SPEAKER_00]: look on, you can see this hole on Google
Earth from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a structure briefly that could
be seen from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hole that produced some really
nice plant fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually in the PETM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we find them, we use extremely
technologically advanced equipment to bind
[SPEAKER_00]: them up so they don't fall apart on the
trip back to the museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go back and sit in the dusty
collections areas and get studied by me
[SPEAKER_00]: and other people who are interested in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the life cycle of fossils,
or at least studying fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over a period of time, this record
goes from, this is just a piece of the
[SPEAKER_00]: record from 56.2 to 55.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a million years of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the record that I've assembled of
flora through time goes for another three
[SPEAKER_00]: or four million years that way and another
three or four million years this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the part of it I wanted to
focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of these crosses is a place
in the Bighorn Basin where we've measured
[SPEAKER_00]: a section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know where we are in relation to
the carbon isotope excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time is running this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just stacked up the locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tend to occur in groupings,
because once you find an interval of time
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have good preservation,
you often find a bunch of sites at that
[SPEAKER_00]: same level where you can find plant
fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a bunch of localities here
and then a bunch there, and then a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: here at the very end of the Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is that onset of the carbon
isotope excursion and the body of the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon isotope excursion here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are not as many, but there are
now something like 15 sites within the
[SPEAKER_00]: body of the excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a bunch that are during
that recovery interval as the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: isotope composition is returning back to
what it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the climate is returning to its
previous state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a bunch more localities
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just piled them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about 100 localities in this
million year interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives you, like we don't have a
perfect record.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone can help me fill in that gap,
that's about a 30,000 year long gap right
[SPEAKER_00]: before the onset of the excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any sites there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a record that we actually can
sort of feel pretty decent about using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you bring back the flora,
you divide them up into provisional
[SPEAKER_00]: species units, and then you can start to
put together a record of how the flora
[SPEAKER_00]: changed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is to a paleontologist,
this is sort of like, the most basic
[SPEAKER_00]: standard diagram, but I'm gonna explain it
to you in case you're not used to looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is time again going this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the stratigraphic ranges of
different taxa, different species level
[SPEAKER_00]: units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every place where there's a ball is a
locality where it's actually recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm making the assumption that the
species was present in this area between
[SPEAKER_00]: the places where it actually occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course it's always possible that
that's incorrect, that it went locally
[SPEAKER_00]: extinct and then came back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's again the body of the carbon
isotope excursion that represents the
[SPEAKER_00]: period when the climate was the hottest
and the most different from the background
[SPEAKER_00]: climate state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the recovery interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can sort of divide this up,
this range chart stratigraphic range chart
[SPEAKER_00]: up into chunks of ranges of different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna describe them and I ask you
to notice the color scheme here of the
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in blue we've got species that come up
close to the end of the Paleocene and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we never see them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are what I would call possible
extinctions, at least permanent regional
[SPEAKER_00]: extirpations of those species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might wonder why they'd all come up
right to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because sampling is not as good as
it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would expect that species that you
don't always sample are going to sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: their last occurrence will be before their
actual last occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another group of species here in
orange that have never been detected in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Paleocene and they've never been
detected in this area after the PETM.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only found during this period of
warm climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of an interesting,
it's like first take on this is these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are immigrating into this part of the
world during this period of much warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: climate and then they're disappearing
again when the climate cools.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few taxa that go through,
that appear to go through the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another group in green
here that show up during the recovery
[SPEAKER_00]: interval or right after the recovery
interval or in some cases a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again could be the sampling problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had more sites I might pick up some
of these guys a little bit lower down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these appear to be immigrants,
they're new to the region, but they aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: showing up during the event, they're
showing up after the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're sort of delayed immigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe the most interesting group
in some ways are these ranges that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: present in many of these species are
present for a couple of million years down
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then strangely they have no occurrences
during the body of the carbon isotope
[SPEAKER_00]: excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to show up again during the
recovery period and then they're found
[SPEAKER_00]: again in the Eocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these I would call local extirpations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're species that appear to have gone
locally their local populations have
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared during the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not present anywhere where I can
find fossils of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come back again after the
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this results in, if you just sort of
try to create the broadest scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tell the difference between a PETM
flora and a flora from before or after?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is it's really obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a non-metric multi-dimensional
scaling, just a way of putting in a sites
[SPEAKER_00]: by species matrix and then reducing the
dimensionality of the data set to express
[SPEAKER_00]: on two axes the differences in floral
composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the sites that we
have from the body of the excursion have a
[SPEAKER_00]: composition as reflected on this diagram
that is really different from both the
[SPEAKER_00]: Eocene and the Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Paleocene and Eocene are more similar
really to one another than either is to
[SPEAKER_00]: these floras from the body of the PETM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these red arrows or orange arrows are
pointing to floras that occur during the
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body of the excursion turns out to
be radically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recovery interval is actually much
more like the floras from either before or
[SPEAKER_00]: after the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of overlap between
Eocene and Paleocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also on this diagram coded each site
by the local environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a certain amount of specificity
of different plant species showing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: different depositional environments on the
floodplain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find plant fossils very commonly in
small lenses of mud that have filled in
[SPEAKER_00]: channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the channel abandons and leaves behind
mud with plant fossils in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other places, we might find a layer
that goes a long ways laterally that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: us we're collecting in a swamp,
in a back swamp, in a fluvial floodplain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a different environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find slightly different species in
that kind of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've coded these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I was interested in doing
that is just to reassure myself that we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't seeing some kind of switch in the
environments that would cause the floras
[SPEAKER_00]: to look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wouldn't really be seeing the
response to climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd just be seeing the response to some
sort of change in the habitat mosaic on
[SPEAKER_00]: the floodplain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red circles, that's the abandoned
channel, oxbow channel environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there are a fair
number of those circle symbols in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Paleocene and Eocene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have a flora anything like
these Paleocene, Eocene thermal maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel reassured that we're not just
seeing some sort of shift in what's being
[SPEAKER_00]: preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that might occur to you to
do is to, if you're aware that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: correlations between leaf size and shape
and climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're able to take those fossil
leaf taxons and do basically essentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization of their sizes and
shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm just going to show you
one slide of results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just to give you a sense of
the characters that are being looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf area, the number of teeth,
the ratio of the number of teeth to the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal perimeter of the leaf,
the shape factor, which has to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: circularity of the leaf, the perimeter
ratio, and the ferret diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are features that have some
climatic significance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not really going to use them that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a series of modern sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work by Dan Pepe and others where
looking at living flora across a big range
[SPEAKER_00]: of vegetation types, you're able to
characterize them according to those leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: size and shape measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do an ordination analysis of
that, you can then place those different
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation types in a kind of physiognomic
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a space defined by the leaf
size and shape variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's a bubble here
for seasonally dry tropical forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one here for temperate
rainforests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Paleocene flora, and also this is
true of the early Eocene ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: fit in this sort of wet temperate
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this leaf physiognomic space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has got nothing to do with the
taxonomic composition of the flora.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about the sizes and shapes of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best site we have from the PETM
where we're able to make these digital
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements fits in the seasonally dry
tropical forest part of the diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that we're seeing a major
change in vegetation type as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: turnover in species composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to go back to this for a second,
I'm just going to now show you some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxa because it's always nice to look at a
few plant fossils and think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: they might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's going to be a color code here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue, the orange for the immigrants,
the green for the delayed immigrants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the purple for the extirpated ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a couple of things that we
think go extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extinct tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a genus called Brownia serrata.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Davidia, which is an extant genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both in cornales, so a clade that
has a lot of diversity in temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they both go extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just to take a look at some of the
things that are locally extirpated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're in the Paleocene and
they're in the Eocene, but we have yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: find them during the body of the carbon
isotope excursion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a couple of different types of
Platinaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extinct genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one actually is also extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trifoliate platinoid,
something that is a bit weird by modern
[SPEAKER_00]: day standards, but these are both very
common, long-ranging species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of common things that are
in the Betulaceae, again, probably extinct
[SPEAKER_00]: genera, but pretty closely allied with,
or quite recognizably, Betulaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something called Phagopsophyllum,
which is probably in the Phagaceae,
[SPEAKER_00]: although even that's uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Sercidophyllaceae,
so Katsura tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something that is essentially
identical to extant Metasequoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dawn Redwood, something almost identical
to modern Ginkgo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are members of the
Loraceae, which is a family, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of tropical and subtropical
lineages in it, as well as some temperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all warm temperate lineages
that go extinct, or that are locally
[SPEAKER_00]: extirpated during the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delayed immigrants also largely have a
sort of temperate deciduous, or temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: forest look to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something in the Tillyaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Alnus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Pistolet inflorescences of this
that make it clear that it is Alnus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Ligodium, and this is in the
Juglandaceae, and very similar to Platica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there's some dispute about
whether it's actually in the genus
[SPEAKER_00]: Platicaria, or something very close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these species that come in after the
event is over, but have not been seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Paleocene, are also temperate
deciduous species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PETM-only plants, the immigrants that
are there for that brief, geologically
[SPEAKER_00]: brief 200,000-year period, are really very
different at a high taxonomic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fabaceae are really abundant,
and also quite diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are one, two, three, four,
five different types of Fabaceae foliage
[SPEAKER_00]: on this slide, and there are a couple more
that aren't here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least three different kinds
of fruits of Fabaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have a lot of diversity,
and I'm going to just show you,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's also this is an extinct genus
called Landinia that was named by Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Manchester and Liz Hermson, oh gosh,
perilously close to 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The foliage of that is something that was
even, going back even farther,
[SPEAKER_00]: was called Sedrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably, whether this is actually
even in Mealyaceae is uncertain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has nice, pinnately compound leaves
that we have, and we have also the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and where we don't have the
flowers, we do have the fruits from these
[SPEAKER_00]: same PETM deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's described from southern Wyoming in a
later period of very warm climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that looks very much
like the extant genus Gyrocarpus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fruits with these very long wings
on them, too, two big wings that come up
[SPEAKER_00]: from the fruit body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are resin glands that are hard to
see in this photograph, but they're there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in the leaves, these very
interesting, sort of irregularly lobate
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, and if you look at extant
Gyrocarpus americana, which actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: pan-tropical distribution, that's kind of
odd, but it is pan-tropically distributed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it likes dry tropical forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of those cases where the
fossil, even though it's 56 million years
[SPEAKER_00]: old, really looks a lot like the modern
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several living species in
Gyrocarpus, and it is remarkably similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the Fabaceous leaf types
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which fruit this goes with,
but we have some really nice specimens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this particular leaf type has an
extremely distinctive venational feature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is it has a very thick marginal vein
that's on one side of the leaflet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the basal side of the
leaflet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it in the specimens that are
preserved in attachment, and on the apical
[SPEAKER_00]: side, the basal side of the same leaflet,
you get sort of places where the margin is
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn in along the secondary veins,
and then there's this peculiar splitting
[SPEAKER_00]: of that marginal vein so that it connects
in two places to the primary of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaflet, and that turns out to be a very
unusual feature, and it shows up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: extant genus Copaeifera, which they're a
bunch of species of in the New World
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics, and it also turns out that it's a
genus that seems to like dry tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the physiognomic data that
suggested that this was a dry tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: forest, and now we have just a couple of
taxa that are these immigrants during the
[SPEAKER_00]: PETM, and they also as far as we're able
to tell have living relatives in dry
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical forests, and this is just a
family level attempt to show you how
[SPEAKER_00]: different the PETM is, and I think I'm
actually gonna sort of go through this one
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because it's not terrifically
important to my point, except just to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that this gives you out of all possible
occurrences, what proportion are seen
[SPEAKER_00]: during the Paleocene in blue, the Eocene
in green, the post-PETM Eocene,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the PETM in orange, and there are some
interesting patterns here, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: so Betulaceae is very, it occurs in many
places before the PETM, in none during the
[SPEAKER_00]: PETM, and in a fairly high proportion of
the places in the Eocene, and Fabaceae has
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the opposite pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've reconstructed with the aid of an
artist what we think that transition might
[SPEAKER_00]: have looked like, and here's a sort of
latest Paleocene relatively wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: warm but wet climate with things like
ginkgoes and metasequoias.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,
the body of that event, with this dry
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical forest here shown in the dry
season, so you can really tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, and then in the early Eocene a
return to a similar kind of vegetation to
[SPEAKER_00]: what we had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think is going on, and just sort
of the biogeographic view of what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing is, so we're sitting and detecting
all this in one spot, and of course we'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to have many other places around the
planet where we could record the same
[SPEAKER_00]: event in other floras, but we don't have
them yet, but I think what is likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: going on is that during the event,
as the event sets on, we're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, as the climate shifts to a much
warmer, and in the case of this
[SPEAKER_00]: continental interior, also probably much
more seasonally dry precipitation regime,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are seeing species that had been
occurring much farther south, at the edge
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tropics perhaps, moving their
ranges northward, we're getting the local
[SPEAKER_00]: extirpation of populations of warm
temperate lineages, which are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: then being left as relics either at high
latitudes or in montane areas at mid
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the warm part of the event,
during the body of the carbon isotope
[SPEAKER_00]: excursion, there's almost certainly some
interchange, and this is seen in the fauna
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as in the flora, across these
halarctic regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting mixing of faunas and
floras between Asia and Europe and North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, in spite of the fact that they
look like we have big water gaps here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they must not be preventing the migration
or the extension of ranges across the high
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes, and then as you go into the
recovery and the cooling of climate back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Eocene, basically some of those
species that had gotten across between
[SPEAKER_00]: continents are moving back into the
temperate regions, and that's where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting these delayed immigrants,
the temperate lineages that are showing up
[SPEAKER_00]: in North America for the first time in the
Eocene had been derived from either high
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude areas or from other continents
than North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me see, I am, is this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about it, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be wrapping up, and I sort of
just did, and I'm looking for Alejandro to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me what, like should I go for,
I can do a very fast version of,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know people have classes and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will give you the very shortest of
overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked about climate change,
obviously there's another component of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, what's the CO2 concentration in the
atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a geoscience question,
and it was, and probably everybody's aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of this, but this Swante Arrhenius over
100 years ago said, and this is a quote
[SPEAKER_00]: from his paper, doubling of the percentage
of CO2 in the air would raise the surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of the earth by four degrees
Celsius, and this is the IPCC report from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 saying the likely range of
equilibrium climate sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the same number, is one and a half
to four and a half degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of feel like how much progress
have we made in 100 years in knowing what
[SPEAKER_00]: the relationship is between the amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere and the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: of the planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would appear not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the problems in answering that
question is it takes a long time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 to warm the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an event when the amount of
CO2 in the atmosphere increased a great
[SPEAKER_00]: deal in a few thousand years, you actually
have a great setup for answering this
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the PETM is a place where we're trying
to answer the question, and we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it with using stomatal evidence from
fossil ginkgoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know what stomata are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something called stomatal index,
which is the number of stomata divided
[SPEAKER_00]: through by the number of epidermal cells
plus the number of stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, in these same sections that I've
been working in, remarkably well-preserved
[SPEAKER_00]: ginkgo fossils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 56.1 million-year-old ginkgo
fossil, and there's a whole plastic bag
[SPEAKER_00]: full of fossilized ginkgo cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the preservation of these is quite
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fossil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a living ginkgo biloba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some work that I did with Dana
Royer years ago trying to develop a
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration for using herbarium sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's the relationship between that
stomatal index number and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 in the atmosphere over the last couple
hundred years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It appeared there was a very strong
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich Barclay, the guy I mentioned at the
beginning, came to work with me on a
[SPEAKER_00]: postdoc, and we discovered that the
picture wasn't quite as pretty as we had
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was when we did the work back
in the early part of this millennium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the relationship is much messier.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are points way out in the... So this
is historical data, and this is a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had been a few experiments done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed basically a reconstruction of
changing CO2 right before the PETM,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a few specimens of ginkgo from
the recovery period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks as if there is a substantial
increase from, say, a little bit more than
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-industrial levels, like mid-1990
levels of CO2, and about a doubling in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 100,000 years or 50,000 years prior
to the PETM, which is consistent with an
[SPEAKER_00]: observed warming of about five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very cool, except we had a lot
of trouble believing that because the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration curve out here is very poorly
constrained by just a few experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few years ago, we set up this
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly, I've been a scientist for 40
years, and I can confess to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never done a serious experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can say that to a bunch of
people who work on living plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I have never done an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an old scientist who never did an
experiment, and now we're doing an
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my respect for people who do
experiments has gone through the... I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to complain about field work, but
experiments are really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have chambers, and the chambers have
blowers, and we're exposing ginkgoes to
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 outside, 400 in chambers, 600 parts
per million in chambers, 800 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million in chambers, and 1,000 parts per
million in chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have armies of grad students at
the Smithsonian, so we have armies of
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers working on this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have online volunteers,
and you can help us with this if you wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: count stomata, because there's a site here
where you can count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people in the cloud counting
stomata for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, it's gonna take a few years,
we think, for the plants to actually fully
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt physiologically to the high CO2
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not seeing a response yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also trying to make measurements
of conductance and photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also measuring their carbon
isotope composition, because there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: suggestion that the amount of
discrimination may be also a possible
[SPEAKER_00]: proxy for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the quick version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a couple of minutes for questions.
All of the species that I recognize here
are C3 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any indication of shifts
between C3 and C4?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no indication of any C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not in the fossils, but also not
in the... When you sample floodplain soils
[SPEAKER_00]: for organic carbon, the isotopic
composition of the organic matter is
[SPEAKER_00]: always consistent with pure C3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, which is interesting,
because during the event, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: during the event, CO2 goes up,
so maybe that would disadvantage C4
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years ago, Michael Christiansen and
I showed that the leaves of Ginkgo removed
from short and long shoots of different
LMAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you accounting for... Because of your
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are... And yeah, no, we are actually...
There are 50 leaves on each tree that are
[SPEAKER_00]: marked with a little tiny twisty,
twist tie type thing around the petiole
[SPEAKER_00]: before they absize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're labeled with which branch
they're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches are numbered on every tree
and the short shoots are numbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have... We know which leaves are...
Not only do we know whether they're short
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot or long shoot, we know where on the
tree they came from exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all... They're clones and they're
all male trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to eliminate some of the
sources of variation, but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do you think that there is not yet
a response in this, in the Ginkgo leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know why there's not yet a
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these trees are maybe a meter and
a half, two meters tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that they are... They
have enough stored starch and... I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it may take them a little
while to realize that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they obviously have... Ginkgos
are... Everyone knows Ginkgos are stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they appear to be changing the
conductivity of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can measure changes in
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there may be some history to the
carbon that's already in the plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: affecting how quickly it adjusts its model
anatomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a made up thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could also be that they don't
respond above some level of CO2 and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire business of inferring how much
CO2 is in the atmosphere above 400 parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million or something is just balloon
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that could be just wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
