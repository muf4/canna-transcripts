[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, without any further ado,
I'm here to tell you a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm proud to stand up here
and say that what Laurie and I are about
[SPEAKER_00]: to do today continues to be a good
indication of how, when conducted
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, Cooperative Extension in New
York State and the United States is still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and well, and still a very important
part of the land-grant mission that I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to maintain its importance as we
head through difficult budget time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my political statement for the
start of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal statement is it's always
wonderful to have colleagues like Laurie
[SPEAKER_00]: who make for a wonderful partnership where
we know there's a need, we identify the
[SPEAKER_00]: way we want to approach it, we identify
the behaviors we want to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go after it and do it in very
classic Cooperative Extension fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the message for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to wonder what you all do with
yourselves coming out to listen to a lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: talk on a day like this, but we're glad
you're here nevertheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do, you know, lawns, why, what is it
doing here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I care about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should completely get rid of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact is lawns both cover a lot of
grass, a lot of grass, a lot of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Malesi of 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did some spectral work from a NASA
satellite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the land cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I think it's about 33, 30,
I'm not even sure exactly the land
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage, but you can see that it tends to
be focused around urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has enormous economic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an $85 billion in industry
nationally, and lawns make up 65% of that
[SPEAKER_00]: economic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So golf and sports and sod, all the other
things account for the other 35%
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York State, we did a survey back in
2003, so that's fairly dated now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at that time it was a $5 billion
industry, and in New York about 75% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic value came from people buying
stuff for their lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hiring a service, but buying things
for their lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment, fertilizers, pesticides,
seed, services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have a farm gate value,
the NAS did the stats, they did it for us
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2003 based on the way we projected the
amount of money people spend on lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of, so why do we have
lawns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need lawns?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need lawns because we do this to
where we have lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a high percentage of
impervious surface, you have enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on the way water, for example,
will move through that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it then heightens the importance of
these vegetated green spaces, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing a particular part of it we can see
from this slide is lawns, and so how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: view the lawn as something that helps us,
or at least recognize, as the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Chesapeake Bay area have recognized,
that this is a significant land use that
[SPEAKER_00]: may not serve a purpose out here,
to have it doing the things we do with it
[SPEAKER_00]: in urban areas, in Nebraska, but in areas
where we have a lot of pavement,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a lot of sense to have something
to mitigate the problems that the pavement
[SPEAKER_00]: causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know lawns are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of impervious surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that the climate is changing
dramatically, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that works in growing something
recognizes that this is some data from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011 from NOAA, and at that time they were
keeping weather records for 117 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and two parts of the United States had the
warmest year on record, the March to
[SPEAKER_00]: August 2011 growing season, and in the
Northeast and in the Midwest here had the
[SPEAKER_00]: 108th and 109th, so in the top 10% of the
warmest years ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the climate is changing, lots of lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to love a good lawn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we embark on a project like
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me give you some background.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my job is to sort of set the stage
for Lori to pick up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about our program and what we
focused on, a programmatic approach to how
[SPEAKER_00]: we do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: High-touch, high-tech used to mean a lot
20 years ago when I started in Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean as much now, but I want to
show you we've come through the ranks on
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like that in Extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some good scholarship and,
of course, measuring impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at this a long time in turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the United States Golf
Association Green section record from July
[SPEAKER_00]: of 1921 when Cornell was commended for
starting a short course for park and
[SPEAKER_00]: grounds managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Levittown, the original subdivision,
suburban, love a good lawn place,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so as this happened in the 40s,
right, at the same time, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: not long after, about 20 years later,
we started to realize the pressure on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Island groundwaters, the groundwater
that the Long Island citizens use for
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking water was under siege from
agriculture, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we looked at urban areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So historically, we did, the Cornell,
in cooperation with the Water Resources
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute, Dave Bolden, did a bunch of
surveys of lawns on Long Island in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1970s looking for are lawns leaky,
are things leaching out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater, and what they found was that,
if you look at the data, as the lawn ages,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic matter gets accumulating in
there, starts to supply a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in the weeds we're getting with,
in the 70s, we figured out, we knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: this was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to be honest, we're slow learners,
but now these people outside of the turf
[SPEAKER_00]: field just published a paper this past
month on household management practices in
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on global warming of home lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they concluded was, as the lawn
ages, you shouldn't fertilize it as much
[SPEAKER_00]: because it increases the global warming
problem by putting out nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaks into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is 300 times more potent as a
greenhouse gas than carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to see how things that
started here at Cornell are now still very
[SPEAKER_00]: currently a part of the thinking about
taking care of lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a strong research project
based for a long time, very much focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on environmental quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been the emphasis of our program
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a focus with our
collaboration with the New York State IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: program on a progressive pest management
approach that's both ecologically based
[SPEAKER_00]: and uses IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, from an extension
perspective, our work is always focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced decision making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to create information that
you just let loose at a website or on a
[SPEAKER_00]: booklet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing when you take that
information and help people to make
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions to make their lives or the
environment better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our programmatic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the history and maybe our focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our approach to this particular project
fits in like every other thing that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a resource going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work that resource in various
venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, of course, you can add the
augmented environment since we do webinars
[SPEAKER_00]: and Google chats and Skype and everything
else that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're connected to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the high touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we're still learning how to
work in those augmented environments for
[SPEAKER_00]: the high tech part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we check out how we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put all this energy into doing all this
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we change behavior?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I think, a thing a lot of
extension people don't always get,
[SPEAKER_00]: that just putting the information out
there isn't the role of extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of dopes that put
information out all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't help you make decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a singular science-based focus
of cooperative extension, at least from my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an issue closer to lawns as
environmental assets was when I got here
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1996, we had just signed the New York
City watershed agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat on a governor's panel with
particularly protecting the resources on
[SPEAKER_00]: the east of Hudson urban water the urban
watershed that's the east of Hudson and
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily phosphorus loading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Marty Petrovic and I did a bunch of
work over the years looking at leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: and runoff of different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put together that research with
colleagues in New England to sort of get a
[SPEAKER_00]: better handle on from a large perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, from an extension perspective,
we developed an almanac.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at lawn care and water quality
in a calendar format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was January.
[SPEAKER_00]: You opened it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, what should I be doing in January?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kinds of things, if I want to
have a good lawn and protect water
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, what are the kinds of things you
can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then did a bunch of training for
several years with this almanac that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be 18 years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we went back and surveyed how
effective we were from the money we got
[SPEAKER_00]: from the New York City watershed,
40% of those, we educated this,
[SPEAKER_00]: went out and self-tested for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said to them, 90% of the lawns east of
Hudson don't need supplementary
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you test and you got this number,
don't put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had enormous impact in the
training that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, the 400 or 500 people that we
trained, particularly through this
[SPEAKER_00]: process, Master Gardeners and otherwise,
all said we raised their awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea all the ways taking care
of their lawn could impact water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is translated further in some of
my professional extension work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The golf superintendents and the golf
industry came and gave us $160,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a best management practice set of
principles that's online that was both
[SPEAKER_00]: reviewed by our scientific colleagues for
accuracy and also by people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Division of Water and the Division of
Pesticides for the DEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they looked at what we wrote here,
so it's congruous with their regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're currently in a phase two
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now assessing superintendents' use
and changing of behavior for now that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have this resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, on our way to the e-book,
which is to me the height of the star of
[SPEAKER_00]: the show here, obviously climate change is
a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one we think about all the time
because this is when people take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: their lawns or their gardens, they can
potentially have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their practices may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some research about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually a class I taught,
a bunch of undergrads and grad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got together and asked this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the number one downloaded TERF
article from the TERF information file
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked the question, how much carbon
are we burning?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are we sequestering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some good preliminary data that many,
many have published beyond this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also published a paper looking at how
the changing environment increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive environment for a foliar
pathogen, in this case, dollar spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I published it with Art DiGaitano.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually found, looking at weather
records over a 50 year period,
[SPEAKER_00]: how pest pressure from the environment has
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these black dots are where the
environment is getting more conducive to
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular foliar pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some foundational data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate change is the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how it's impacting disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We published a research article on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that forecasting information
in our weekly newsletter that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: written about our surveys from in the
Journal of Extension, an example of
[SPEAKER_00]: just-in-time education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the forecasting and predicting of
these issues are part and parcel to our
[SPEAKER_00]: weekly newsletter and also well-integrated
into our forecast website that's managed
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Northeast Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a commercial way where we've
identified how climate change is altering
[SPEAKER_00]: pest pressure, how do we help the managers
make better decisions by regular contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with them through the shortcut newsletter
and forecasting how the risk for the
[SPEAKER_00]: particular problems might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might not use as many pesticides
in taking care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bethpage State Park is another example
of some of the decision-making work that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we started with the New York
State Park policy people who wanted to ban
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides across the entire state park
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, maybe you should treat golf
courses differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I partnered up with Jennifer Grant for
the New York State IPM program and started
[SPEAKER_00]: working with the 27 state golf courses
throughout New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a resource here developed by Bob
Portmes when he was a graduate student and
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized in his time now as an extension
associate funded through the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State Parks Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've taught national seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently, you know, we started
working at Bethpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we work at all 27 state parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had pretty good superintendent
extension update from our website hits and
[SPEAKER_00]: our extension colleagues continue to use
this in their training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat Vittum uses it in her class at the
University of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those that have done, gone through our
national training said that 25 to 40% by
[SPEAKER_00]: using tools developed through this,
we're able to reduce their environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: impact of their pest management program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, how do we help people make
decisions and how do we determine how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing on the other end?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little gloating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the book I did a number of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the top selling what was the
N-rays now was cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's pals.
[SPEAKER_00]: This book is still their number one
seller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's a tool devised for helping
people decide what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to remind you of the approach that we
take and the introduction to Lori's effort
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our thinking based on all that I've led to
to this point is that lawns are a resource
[SPEAKER_00]: in an increasingly urbanized environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you ask people what a sustainable
lawn is, they'll give you a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: answers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what perspective they come
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what makes a lawn an
environmental asset or what makes a lawn
[SPEAKER_00]: we can sustain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sort of wordsmith different
definitions, but optimizes the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: In harmony with conserving natural
environment under economically sound and
[SPEAKER_00]: socially responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of us adapt these things for
whatever crop we're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our emphasis has been on the
functional aspects of the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why this isn't love a great
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's love a good lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Gallup poll people are when you
ask the degree to which Americans worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from 2008 or nine, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that how many worry about
these particular environmental problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water pollution, drinking water pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global warming has about 50%, not much at
all, think about global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is four years ago, so it may
have changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point I'm building to is
environmental actions in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been little increase in general in
environmental action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, the biggest thing they do is
recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the board, the biggest thing they
do is recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the challenge we face in getting
people to look at lawns as an
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental asset is very much tied to
the economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a Gallup poll taken all the way
into 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one of these statements about the
environment and the economy do you most
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Protection of the environment should be
given priority even at the risk of curbing
[SPEAKER_00]: economic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or economic growth should be given
priority even if the environment suffers
[SPEAKER_00]: to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the gap from 1985 when
they first started asking these questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: right around the turn of the century,
you started to see, well, I sort of think
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment's important, but I got to
have money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was, you could see the downturn
in the economy right here, where now a
[SPEAKER_00]: much bigger concern for economic stability
than environmental quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how these things are
hovering right around each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get people to pay attention to
environmental issues, it has to make
[SPEAKER_00]: economic sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an easy sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you tell people, caring about the
environment inherently could mean you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to spend less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to balance those things for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was a tough go even internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American Society of Landscape
Architects, in cooperation with Lady Bird
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnson and the US Botanic Garden,
said, we want this sustainable sites
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative, which is essentially lead the
building standards for lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, for the outside, for the
landscape, lead for the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right out of the gate, they basically
said, well, you can't have a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: site if you have any grass, because there
were no recommendations for having grass
[SPEAKER_00]: in this initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put a class together and did some
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can tell you is we're up
against quite a battle, both this issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: our own peers don't have to understand the
role that these things play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know how this governs a lot of
the landscapes that we manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, in difficult economic
times, people tend to reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment to environmental quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is what makes the sell
we're doing with this new project even
[SPEAKER_00]: tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make environmental quality
make economic sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly the approach we took
with this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean for lawn care?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my career has led me to this point
where I believe we've got to anticipate
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect that climate change is going to
have on managing the things that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to position the lawn as a
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't just be a beauty contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be, I got to have a good lawn,
because the Joneses down the block have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good lawn, and I want to have the best
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know from current economic and sort
of environmental awareness surveys,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people still feel like they got
to have a good lawn to keep up with their
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we must adopt a progressive approach
that balances cost, look, and function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where we get this wonderful
resource now that capitalizes on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I've talked about in the
past, but now really utilizes that
[SPEAKER_00]: technology in a really meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not like it's any great deal,
people make iBooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, this is leading edge in some
of the cooperative extension stuff that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without any further ado, I'm going to
transfer just two minutes past,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, to my colleague Laurie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few more minutes on a few more
slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to show you sections of
the iBook.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Frank alluded to, several reasons
why it was a top priority to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn care for him, and for me,
equally, I was thinking about why should I
[SPEAKER_01]: care about lawn care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with our garden-based learning
program, certainly thinking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: people, our environmental stewards,
is a top priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an easy sell for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several other reasons are that there are
2.8 million acres of home lawns in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York state alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what people do with their lawns really
makes it matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was another compelling reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in Cornell Cooperative Extension,
around the state, we have county offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our county offices report,
they get phone calls from the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they report that 50% of their calls
related to gardening and lawn care,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of them are lawn care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some counties, that's 800 calls
a year, people calling up and asking about
[SPEAKER_01]: some practice that relates to lawn care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another compelling reason for me to be
involved and for me to get the people I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with, the horticulture educators and
the master gardener volunteers involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certainly Frank relayed lots of
research and new information that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out about lawns and how lawns are an
environmental asset, as well as some new
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't touch on some of the new
regulations, but there's some new
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations out there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another reason why we want those
Cooperative Extension educators and master
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener volunteers to be aware of the
best management practices that are based
[SPEAKER_01]: on research-based information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, Frank, was willing to
partner with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certainly, I could pick other topics,
but if I don't have a research faculty
[SPEAKER_01]: member who can help me develop that
resource with their expertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another critical thing that led us in the
direction of trying out an iBook was that
[SPEAKER_01]: we did get funding from New York State IPM
to help offset the cost of developing this
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So critical reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why did we decide that we would try
to create an iBook?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to be current and connected
to where people are getting information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this report is actually from 2012,
so I think it's probably even more,
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers are higher now, but a Pew
Research Center revealed that 43% of
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans age 16 or older have read an
eBook as a source of pleasure or gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are using eBooks, and so maybe
Extension could be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you who are laughing,
I know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, Frank already showed you this,
and the handout will connect you to
[SPEAKER_01]: iTunes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did the eBook in iTunes, and there
are many logistical reasons why I did
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the main being my knowledge of
programming is limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: An iTunes iBook author makes it somewhat
accessible for somebody with my knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not tell you it was easy,
but I couldn't do it in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: format, but they made it slightly easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to get to the iBook,
which can only be viewed on a Mac,
[SPEAKER_01]: a smartphone, or a Mac laptop that has
iBook on it, so it has some limits that
[SPEAKER_01]: way, or an iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go into iTunes and you search
under lawn care, you get like this many
[SPEAKER_01]: books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of them are based on,
backed with research-based information,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll tell you how exciting some of
them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you want to spend on
lawns?
[SPEAKER_01]: This book on organic lawn care,
it's only 250 pages long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one, 100 lawn care tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five says, think about your lawn
just before going to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure most of the people we're
trying to reach who are taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: their lawns are not going to spend the
time to shift through some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really our intention with our iBook,
eBook, is to make it much more accessible
[SPEAKER_01]: to those who want to spend a limited
amount of time thinking about their lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really the ad for that is to make a
book that's an average lawn person,
[SPEAKER_01]: to really maximize the number of people
who actually look at the information and
[SPEAKER_01]: do the right thing, change their
behaviors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you'll see that those books
essentially are PDFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're PDFs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put PDFs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually in extension know how to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Craig can edit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but this iBook, I'll show you some
clips from it, And the intention was to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the text limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see it's actually only 45
pages long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if no one read beyond page 12,
most people would be doing the right,
[SPEAKER_01]: and did what was in the first 12 pages,
they'd be doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beyond those first 12 pages are just
like bonuses for people who are geeking
[SPEAKER_01]: out about their lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a section where we ask
people to actually go to a Qualtrics
[SPEAKER_01]: survey and they can give us feedback on
what they get, behaviors they might have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed by reading the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have that sort of built into the
book, a little opportunity for feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of the layout of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to escape this and try
to quickly go to iBooks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you download it, you then open up
iBook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will actually come out,
it'll look a little different when you
[SPEAKER_01]: first open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just the last page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to do it slightly
differently so you see what happens when
[SPEAKER_01]: you open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you open it up, you get really the
last page that you looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let me see if I can,
might have to keep it down for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to show you the table of
contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to go to the
thumbnails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to go big screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this thumbnail just shows you quickly
what's in the book, rough thing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first section here,
four steps to success.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the first, actually only 10
pages because there's two intro pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to actually show you
first the intro movie, the simple steps
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're trying to get across to
introduce people to really the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important things they need to do to care
for their lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a number of these videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them are less than, most of them
are about a minute long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are, the longest one is three
minutes, but most of them are quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole book really aims at being an
easy short read and friendly words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying not to use any language that a
typical, maybe even eighth grader wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: already have that vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to the four steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the four steps in which if they
just did these few things, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: terribly exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would have a great impact on how
lawns are an environmental asset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lawn care people are environmental
stewards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to skip right to make
adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can jump around easily in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down here, you can even flip back to
whatever page you previously were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We list, keep the mower blade sharp,
mow grass higher, mulch grass clippings,
[SPEAKER_01]: mow tree leaves in the fall, patch weak or
bare spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to skip to the mow grass
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to see if I can,
I can, actually I'm going to flip back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go to sharpen your mower
blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all the videos, as with the words
in the book, most all of it is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to, well, you could do this,
or you could do this, or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We essentially went to, these are not
necessarily avid gardeners who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: know all this information and who delve
into it and wants to make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people who are like,
I have this house, I have this lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the heck am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're saying, just do this,
do this, do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just trying to address that audience
who don't want a whole bunch of options.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just say, no, no, no, what can I do
to do the right thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of the videos really focus on
just do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as Frank mentioned, all of these
videos were filmed and edited by
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't make these.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have structured how they would
come out, but we didn't make them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm sort of going to flip
through the first 10 pages, do less,
[SPEAKER_01]: skip spring feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I should also say all of our
images, so all of our images we had to,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was out there in iTunes,
all of our images had to have been our
[SPEAKER_01]: images.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also must tell you, I found great
images on Flickr.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go to those that allow you to
use them with recognition, got great
[SPEAKER_01]: images online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found on Flickr, I know everybody's
looking for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so this is really page 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also a very short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the sort of bulk of the
content that we want people to focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can always go back up to either
the thumbnails or the table of contents
[SPEAKER_01]: and flip through the book some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just show you advanced care just to
highlight what we have in advanced care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feeding, which is what lots of people
think of fertilizing as feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We consider that in the advanced care
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really part of those first 11
pages that really mostly you want people
[SPEAKER_01]: to use a sharp mower blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everyone did that, the fuel
consumption that would be saved would be
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will show you again even information
about insects pests and weeds is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see if it'll go to the insect
section for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, just a little sluggish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the insect section, we actually,
throughout the book, I have a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: galleries, photo galleries, which you can
embed in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can add content that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as this interactive image.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will conflict on it and get some
additional information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can, very easy to flip
through the book this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can quickly find something that,
oh, I wanted to know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said all the way back,
I have a place where you can share
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I want to mention that we
haven't really launched this book because
[SPEAKER_01]: we finished it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lawn care season is a little under
the weather right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people aren't really thinking about
lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we plan to launch it this spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've done a sort of a soft launch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will fully launch it and hopefully
get some good press and some sending it
[SPEAKER_01]: out to those people we want to take a look
at it and get some feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even though we haven't really sent it
out to a wide selection of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have actually had people click on the
yes that this book was helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the exciting thing was that the things
that they say they were going to change,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that goes to two questions,
and it asks if you're going to change any
[SPEAKER_01]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three responses I got was I'm going to
change how I fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to remove the high spots in my
lawn so I don't scalp my lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to stay on keeping my
mower blade sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So already, the indications from those few
people are like, OK, they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting the message because maybe
we're keeping it simple enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not giving them too much
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few people would sit through Frank's
20 brief minutes about lawn care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are very polite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really tried to sort of
entertain them as well as try to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as next steps go, this is kind
of the Bible for lawn care in our
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative extension system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to go back to
acknowledgment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had the opportunity to take this and
make easy updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see that it's already version
1.1 because I already found things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to update.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy enough for Frank to feed me
information, and then I can make updates
[SPEAKER_01]: in the text.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people who already downloaded
the book will get notice that it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: updated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can also do is we have about
seven videos in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get additional resources,
we can change some of the text to add more
[SPEAKER_01]: videos that just didn't have the resources
to produce any more than seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of those might be related to under
what circumstances should you be mulching
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves or what conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are some municipalities who
thought that leaf mulching, requiring
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone to mulch their leaves,
would be a wonderful way to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are circumstances under which
they won't mulch well and people won't
[SPEAKER_01]: like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one thing that we're looking
forward to in the future, as well as using
[SPEAKER_01]: this as the core portion of the Master
Gardener volunteer training about lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: cares.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we have about five more
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe take some questions or comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
