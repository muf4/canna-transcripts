[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Joyce mentioned, I'm the growth chamber
supervisor for the Cornell Ag experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: station and I've had that job for nine
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I worked for the Tanksley lab
for almost 20 years, I attended a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seminars in this room and never really
expected to be giving one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have something you might be
interested in and I'm very happy to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you about the two growth chambers that my
crew designed and built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to talk about why we think
that these chambers should be the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that Cornell adopts as we try to move away
from the old chambers that we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand what we have now,
let's take a quick look back at how we got
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put on, oh yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had growth chambers at Cornell since
1964.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more than 40 years, each department
had their own chambers that they
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled and that's how it was,
not just for chambers, but also for farms
[SPEAKER_00]: and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each department had their own chambers,
their own specific greenhouses with their
[SPEAKER_00]: own watering staff, their own farms,
each with a farm manager and staff and
[SPEAKER_00]: tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2010, farms, greenhouses and growth
chambers were taken away from departmental
[SPEAKER_00]: control and given to the Ag experiment
station to manage with the idea that there
[SPEAKER_00]: would be more improved efficiency and we'd
reduce the duplication of equipment and
[SPEAKER_00]: personnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember back then, Cornell,
like the rest of the country, was trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to recover from the economic recession of
2008 and so they were looking for ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now all these facilities could be under
one managerial umbrella, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and growth chambers could be looked at as
one single group and decisions could be
[SPEAKER_00]: made about which chambers we might be able
to discard because a lot of them were not
[SPEAKER_00]: only very old, but also they were very
expensive to operate and a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't even used all that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did discard about 34 chambers in the
first few years, but at about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, we were also having 33 chambers
installed at Weill Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were pretty sure we weren't gonna
short ourselves of growth chamber space,
[SPEAKER_00]: by throwing away those old ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, for some of the old chambers that
were still in big demand, we got a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to retrofit them by replacing some of the
less efficient parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 old walk-in chambers that are out at
the Kenpost lab, that area, got new
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting and computer controls thanks to a
grant from NYSERDA, which is the New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State Energy Resource and Development
Authority, and that retrofit worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chambers got twice the light intensity
at half the operating cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: NYSERDA was so happy that they immediately
came back with another grant and we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to put new lighting in a lot of our
reach-in chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, a third grant was forthcoming right
after that and they told us that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would buy us six new chambers if we would
agree to throw away 10 of our least
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chamber crew had already done
energy analysis on most of our chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: models by then, so we knew exactly which
chambers were the least efficient and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were all too happy to throw them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, those six chambers that NYSERDA
bought us are in operation at Weill Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at some of the 125
chambers that we currently are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1960s brought us the first 35 chambers
in a collaboration with Dr. Arthur Watson
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimmick of the Plant Pathology Department
and the Environmental Growth Chambers
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, or EGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these chambers are still in use today
down at the Kenpost lab or new insectary
[SPEAKER_00]: and Dimmick lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the growth chamber crew was
established at this time to maintain these
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers and they were based out of the
Plant Pathology Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of slide changes coming up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 70s, all the other departments
wanted their chambers too, so agronomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which crop and soils was known back then,
and plant breeding, plant biology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and horticulture, they invested in about
40 chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were mostly reach-in chambers from
the Shear Corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large space had already been designed
and built into that new Gooderman lab that
[SPEAKER_00]: was built out on the edge of campus back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about half the chambers went to
Gooderman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others went to Bradfield and Plant
Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some may have even found their way
into individual labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the chamber crew, which, whoops,
that went too fast there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber crew, which was still under
Plant Pathology, was asked to maintain all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these new chambers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, we started charging fees
to raise money to buy spare parts for the
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide of the Bradfield chamber
room in one of its better years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen it recently, it doesn't
really look that good anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the next few decades, additional
chambers were sort of added to the fleet
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a professor would write an equipment
grant or brought chambers with them when
[SPEAKER_00]: they came here from another university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in 2000 or thereabouts, Emerson Hall
was renovated to include a large chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: room in the basement where 23 environment
growth chambers were installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would serve the research projects
in the Bradfield Emerson and Plant Science
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were state of the art chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a central computer and digital
controls and humidity, which was new for
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, all of the chambers that
Cornell now had were the traditional kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of chambers in the sense that the
temperature control was achieved through
[SPEAKER_00]: compressors and refrigeration for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And electric heaters for heating,
that's the traditional style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it still is the traditional style in
most places.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, Weill Hall was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large room was set aside in the basement
to house growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, there are 34 chambers at Weill
used by faculty and grad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these chambers are pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're unique because they don't use
compressors or electric heaters to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate temperature like all the other
growth chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This building was designed so that campus
chilled water and building reheat water
[SPEAKER_00]: circulating in pipes overhead would be
used to regulate the temperature inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valves would send hot water and cold water
into separate coils inside the walls of
[SPEAKER_00]: the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fans would circulate air past those
coils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's a, we took the panel off of
one of the Weill chambers to reveal what's
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, obviously, the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the two coils that are inside
the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this system repeats itself on the
opposite wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This method is much more energy efficient
than the traditional way of regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in a chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Weill building architects,
Cornell project managers, and Doug Keefe
[SPEAKER_00]: from the AC&R shop got together with the
Percival scientific engineers to design
[SPEAKER_00]: this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature is usually maintained
within a few tenths of a degree of the set
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who got together to design
this really knew how much energy was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be required by this many chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they designed a system that really
reduced the amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though it works pretty well at
saving energy, there are some other
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with these chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most damaging problem is that the
water system is located on the roof of all
[SPEAKER_00]: those chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic plumbing fittings that are
part of the hot water supply and return
[SPEAKER_00]: system are located on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plastic fittings are rated for a
temperature of 140 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody must have forgot to ask the
Weill people what the temperature of their
[SPEAKER_00]: water was because it's at 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led to a few problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the first year or two, we started
getting cracks in those fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water would leak out and eventually
find its way over the side walls of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber or work its way into the light cap
where all the wiring was for the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ballasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that mix did not go well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water would eventually drip through the
light barrier and it would appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: raining inside the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happened quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or water might flow right through down the
top of that control cabinet and short out
[SPEAKER_00]: the electrical components on its way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once at 3 o'clock in the morning,
one of those plastic fittings broke
[SPEAKER_00]: completely in half and it sent a geyser of
hot water up to the roof of the ceiling of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room where that water fanned out and
it rained down on all the adjacent
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to find a valve way upstream to
kill the flow because we couldn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water is 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eventually shut the water off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about five or six years ago,
I was up on the roof of one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers sponging up the water after
another fitting break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my boss heard what had happened again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he came down to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I was up there and I saw him
come in the room, I yelled down at him,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we could do better than this at half
the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I was frustrated again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really didn't expect anything to
come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't long after that that I
started getting questions like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what exactly would you do to make it
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And having listened to what the crew was
telling me about fixing these problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to them after they fixed a lot
of the other chamber problems that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would have, I knew that they knew exactly
what it would take to make a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber, which components last longer,
which ones are more reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been dealing with chamber
failures for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who better to come up with a lasting
solution than the people who are having to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with this every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a few meetings which eventually
led to a meeting with the director.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crew described how they would make a
very efficient and durable growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the meeting,
we were asked to provide an estimate as to
[SPEAKER_00]: how much it would take, how much it would
cost to build a small prototype to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: prove the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we found a source for a nice
insulated box and found prices for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best components that money could buy,
because I don't want cheap components that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just going to fail, we figured that it
would take about $20,000 to purchase all
[SPEAKER_00]: the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now bear in mind that a commercially
available chamber of this size will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably cost between $75,000 and $80,000
by the time it's delivered and installed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once we got an account number,
we started ordering all the parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took months to get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insulated white box took over six
months because we tried to order it during
[SPEAKER_00]: their busy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also needed them to make some
custom modifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: The door is normally located in the center
of this side of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed them to move it to the right
and down so that we had room to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: control cabinet on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to wait for their slack time
so they could retool their production
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen these boxes often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the supermarket, there's plenty
of them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all say ice on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just asked them to send me one
without the decal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control system took months to get
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went with Argus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those can cost up to
$10,000 each, depending on the components
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would want to have in any
particular situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same company that has
controllers in most of Cornell Greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lifetime support for their
equipment, which is kind of rare in growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber land because if you've got a
commercial chamber, most of them stop
[SPEAKER_00]: providing support for their controller
after about five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to buy used parts or you
have to buy another controller for
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we got 125 chambers, I don't feel
like spending thousands of dollars for
[SPEAKER_00]: each one to upgrade their controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Argus, their system can call me,
text or email me if there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can log in at home, find out what
the problem is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can adjust the settings of any
chamber right from my office desk or right
[SPEAKER_00]: from home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the other parts that we needed were
readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even get some of them overnight and
free shipping overnight too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main parts are really one pump,
two heat exchangers, two valves,
[SPEAKER_00]: two coils, a few fans and a couple of
fluorescent fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insulated box was set on a pedestal,
a sort of metal frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought the box up to a
comfortable working height, but still
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed it to pass underneath doorways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever we intend this chamber to go,
we sort of have to walk that route and
[SPEAKER_00]: measure, will it fit in elevators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it fit through doors?
[SPEAKER_00]: These pedestals also have wheels on them
and leveling feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just roll it to wherever we need
it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pedestal also provides space
underneath the chamber for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more plumbing on top of the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned our lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also didn't put plumbing along the
sides in the back of the chamber either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, these chambers can be stacked
side to side and back to back to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of them we can fit into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most chamber rooms that we have
around in different buildings are really
[SPEAKER_00]: not big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This way, we can really pack them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the idea there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If repairs are ever needed, we just need
to take that panel off and we can get to
[SPEAKER_00]: all the working components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, we haven't had to repair this
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been more than four years since it
was built and it hasn't stopped working
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've replaced the light bulbs once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to avoid doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's been it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this chamber is very energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the basic concept of the Percival
design using the chilled water and the
[SPEAKER_00]: building reheat water to regulate the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we improved it a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take another look at the wild
coils here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wild chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a coil for hot water and a
coil for cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the chamber needs to warm up,
a valve would send hot water into the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: coil and air would blow past that warmed
coil and bring warmer air into the
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just before the chamber reaches the
desired temperature, the computer control
[SPEAKER_00]: system tells the valve to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still a lot of hot water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This coil, that's gradually going to cool
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before it does, that temperature in
the chamber overshoots the set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now to compensate for that,
the controller tells the cold valve to
[SPEAKER_00]: open up and send cold water into the cold
coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this coil is battling this coil
for the set point temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of battle just keeps going
on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of lessens over time and the
overshooting kind of diminishes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still not as efficient as it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if you can see the red
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph of that temperature
battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellow line is the set point line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now the chamber at 830,
the chamber's coming out of day setting
[SPEAKER_00]: and wants to be at 17C for the duration of
the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water, the cold water is going into
the cold coil and it drops the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look how far it overshoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the hot coil is getting more
water and it's coming up here and now the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold coil comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just keeps on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exaggerated example,
sort of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's not a full degree above and
below the set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the slide is there kind of to
demonstrate what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber crew thought, seeing this kind
of thing happen all the time, that if the
[SPEAKER_00]: water going into the chamber was already
at the set point that you want the chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at, the chamber would only need one
set of coils and not two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the temperature would become much more
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, when we built the prototype and
tested it, the valves that we thought were
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do a really good job didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out that the valve, when you
programmed it to open, the minimum it
[SPEAKER_00]: would open was 7% of its full capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sent too much hot or too much cold into
the system at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to start looking for another
valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we eventually found a magnetic valve
that would only open a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just let a little bit of cold or
a little bit of hot into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this chamber maintains the temperature
to within a few hundredths of a degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: the set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red line now lays down right on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the key is finding that
magnetic valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a basic schematic of the plumbing
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three things in constant motion
at all times on this in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This circulating pump just keeps that
water flowing from inside the chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside the chamber to inside the
chamber through the coils where the fans
[SPEAKER_00]: blow the air past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes back out again and gets
recirculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the while these sensors located at
various points along the line are figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: out just what's happening with the
temperature in that loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for some reason the chamber's warming
up a little bit, the controller tells this
[SPEAKER_00]: cold water valve to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when that opens a little bit of
water flows through the exchanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this sensor determines that this
loop is now at the set point and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: close that valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the temperature remains at the set
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the chamber is going from nighttime to
daytime and needs to go up by 10 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: the controller will tell this valve to
open up a fair amount so that this loop
[SPEAKER_00]: then becomes 10 degrees warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as it maintains temperature
during the day, these sensors are just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of monitoring the situation,
tweaking those valves a little bit as
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to keep that temperature where it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This system is a little bit more energy
efficient than the personal chambers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is a lot more efficient than the
traditional chambers that it was built to
[SPEAKER_00]: replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a slide that compares the two
chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously that's the prototype there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the shear 6310.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those chambers are the same amount
of square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have 20 of those shears by the way,
scattered around campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we analyze the electrical consumption
of these two chambers, we set each of them
[SPEAKER_00]: at the exact same conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hooked up our power recorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those recorders ran for exactly 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it was done, we were able to
download these graphs of the electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: activity over that 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously the X axis is time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Y axis is watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this graph right here, the Y axis
starts at zero watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this graph, the Y axis starts at 2000
watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to superimpose this graph on
top of this one, that graph wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: start until, oops, what did I do there?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph over there wouldn't even start
till halfway up this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you a visual idea of how much
less energy this thing uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did all the math, converting watts
to kilowatts and tying instead of 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: to one year, this chamber calculated out
to $2,100 of electricity per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, 325.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the savings of 85%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber is currently being used for
research at Weill Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, it's worked perfectly
for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this design can work well for larger
chambers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a slide of the chamber that my
crew just finished a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 10 times larger than the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interior square feet is 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's designed to replace those 22
walk-in chambers down at the Dimmick lab
[SPEAKER_00]: that are over 50 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the lights in this chamber,
some of the electrical conduit assemblies
[SPEAKER_00]: and the vent louvers were all taken out of
these old 50-year-old chambers and
[SPEAKER_00]: repurposed into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lights were part of a retrofit that
NYSERDA gave us about seven or eight years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still doing well, so we just
reused them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got another controller from Argus,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time we got the insulated box
from Bally, which many of you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: know as a large manufacturer of coolers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a large variety of different
size boxes that we could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time I told them, just send me one
without their refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer required.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total cost for parts for this chamber
was about $30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just $20,000 of it alone went for the
controller in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed bigger fans because of the size
of the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much bigger than the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plumbing parts, that we used for
this chamber, are the exact same ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we used in the small prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same pump, the same heat exchangers,
the same magnetic valves, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chamber works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maintains very tight temperature
control, usually about a tenth of a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not as amazing as what the
smaller one does, but the smaller one is
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously a lot less cubic feet to have to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the fans in the side walls,
all the working parts are located on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each part is easily accessible and easily
removable for a quick change out whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: that might become necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another cool thing about these
chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same plumbing parts are used in every
chamber, so we would only have to stock a
[SPEAKER_00]: few parts to be able to be used anytime on
any chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot different than the way it is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a large part inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chamber is currently working at
Gutterman in room 139, and you are welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: to check it out anytime you're up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just feel free to walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plants in there, but it's not an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wanted to see how different
species would grow in that chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should mention that since Gutterman does
not have the infrastructure like Weill
[SPEAKER_00]: Hall to support this kind of chamber,
we had to design it with its own chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can get that without turning it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the chiller and its own hot water
heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chamber kind of uses that equipment
until such time as we can get a new
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure at Gutterman to support
this kind of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a 10-square-foot prototype
and a 100-square-foot prototype chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need a few different chamber
sizes to accommodate all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of research done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, Bradfield and Plant Science
would probably benefit by having some
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers that are designed for Arabidopsis
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that in mind, the crew has now
started to work on a third prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has 30-square-feet of growing
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The footprint of that box is
15-square-feet, but the plan is to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf right across the middle,
giving us two growing spaces, and each
[SPEAKER_00]: space would have its own lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be 30-square-feet total.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is possible that we could use some
white LED lights in this chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would get more energy savings from
LEDs, and the lights would almost never
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chamber could go 50 years,
and we may not have to do anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's wishful thinking,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this chamber is finished,
we're gonna move it to Weill Hall and
[SPEAKER_00]: connect it up to that infrastructure to
test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe we'll look into a fourth
prototype this time maybe a step-in model
[SPEAKER_00]: with 50-square-feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would give us a 10, 30,
a 50, 100-square-foot size chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we would need any different
sizes than that, but we might want to vary
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of features that are available in
these chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the walk-ins would benefit from
having some HID lights rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescents for those high
light-requiring props.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe CO2 capability and some
reach-ins or step-ins would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the $64 million question is,
when are we gonna start mass-producing
[SPEAKER_00]: these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's some things we gotta
consider before we jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first is, who is going to build
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we're building a prototype,
we're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we start mass-producing them,
we are going to need to hire that out and
[SPEAKER_00]: pay prevailing union wage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to collaborate on this kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realize that the cost to build them
will probably about double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cost to build this big one was kind of
deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost $30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect labor would about double that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you consider that Cornell
recently purchased a commercial growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chamber of the same size for $180,000,
the $60,000 price tag for this chamber is
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit easier to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing applies for this small
chamber, but it's not exactly as dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was $20,000 for parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if labor adds another $20,000,
the $40,000 cost for this chamber still
[SPEAKER_00]: beats the approximate $80,000 cost to get
a commercial chamber of this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we've broached the subject of
money, the second consideration is,
[SPEAKER_00]: where are we going to get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there are 57 walk-in and
reach-in chambers in operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're between 45 and 55 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: These machines are being trusted with your
research obligations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we want to think about it or not,
those chambers are going to need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really should have been planning on
doing that 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to replace those 57
chambers with 62 of the prototype-style
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recently did the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: 27 walk-in chambers plus 35 reach-in
chambers would cost about $7.6 million if
[SPEAKER_00]: we purchased them from a commercial
chamber company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we paid somebody to build them
ourselves, it would cost approximately $3
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that somehow we're going to
have to get new chambers pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to save $4.6 million when we do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the $3 million price tag is hard to
swallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to do this in a gradual
way to lessen the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to concentrate on replacing
all the chambers in one building at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then do the same thing in another
building about two to three years later
[SPEAKER_00]: until all the 50-year-old chambers are
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, the cost is spread out over
time, and it's something that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: budget for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, to sort of help with finding a
way to purchase chambers, the Cornell Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment Station set up a depreciation
fund for chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chamber fees were raised 15%,
and that money goes into a depreciation
[SPEAKER_00]: fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the extended future, we may have a
way to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a gradual way, changing out chambers
every 30 or 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the immediate future, we're still
going to need a way to find some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somehow we'll get it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building these prototypes and installing
them at Weihall is very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That building is set up for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no other building is set up
that way right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some buildings would be easier to
modify than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bradfield, for instance, there's already
access to chilled water here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could insert a heat exchanger right
into the chilled water line in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical space directly behind the
chamber room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then plumb in a dedicated loop from
that chilled water right into the chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: room and do the same for the building
reheat water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way all the chambers in that room
could be served with this infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be not near as big as doing,
say, a Weihall or a Gutterman.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rooms are much bigger there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So campus chilled water is just not
available everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not available at Kenpost or
Insectory, maybe someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably never going to be
available out at Gutterman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that kind of situation, we would
have to install a large chiller to
[SPEAKER_00]: generate the amount of chilled water
that's going to be required to serve a
[SPEAKER_00]: room full of chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure there would have to be
completely redone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is obviously, that would be
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at Gutterman, if 40 chambers are
served by this one instrument,
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, that kind of spreads the
cost out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a little more acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you factor in the savings you
would get by building these chambers here,
[SPEAKER_00]: combined with the energy savings you get
every year for the life of the chamber,
[SPEAKER_00]: the payback rate on that investment of
infrastructure looks a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've shown these chambers to people
who are in a position to make projects
[SPEAKER_00]: like this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very impressed with the
accomplishment of the chamber crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you like chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also understand all the things
that they have to consider before they
[SPEAKER_00]: jump ahead with this kind of project.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end, there are many, many
priorities that need attention to cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growth chambers are just one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to show you who's responsible
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two people responsible,
above all others, for the design and
[SPEAKER_00]: construction of these prototypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Bob Wilson on the left and Mark
Daly on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the whole thing from start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charles Duffy, the third member of the
chamber crew, also helped out by
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing ideas to its design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and Bob would bounce ideas off each
other for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ideas eventually led to coming
up with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chamber crew is really the only
reason we can still use 50-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really know how to fix them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy Leed and I also contributed a little
bit to the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was primarily Bob and Mark who
brought this concept to a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank Peter Paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was responsible for providing the funds
for us to build the large prototype that's
[SPEAKER_00]: out at Gutterman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until recently, he was the assistant dean
for cows facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he is the associate dean for
finance of cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another person who deserves credit and
thanks and plenty of it is Mike Hoffman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the former director of the Cornell
Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: About five years ago, he trusted this crew
enough to give us the money to build that
prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and Glenn Evans were very supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Jan Nairop is the head of the Cornell
Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and Glenn continue to give us the
support we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also John Conklin, he works out a campus
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in the shop at Campus Area Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he fabricated all those pedestals that
the boxes sit on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, Anya Tim is an
administrative assistant at the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment Station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was very essential because she
showed me how to put together a PowerPoint
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, she found a source for these
translucent CUAES logos that light up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the windows of these prototypes during the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a nice touch, so I appreciate
her help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is probably more than you ever
expected to know about growth chambers in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, I'd be happy to
answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the current occupancy rate for
Cal's growth chambers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's in excess of 95%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you off the top of my head
which chambers are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy because there aren't very
many that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, I would like to have 10% excess
capacity so that people don't have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a waiting list when they want a
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no sin in having a chamber sit
idle, I don't think, if it's ready and
[SPEAKER_00]: available when somebody needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be just shut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to sit there and run all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can just turn them right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't really do that with the old
50-year-old ones because those
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigeration units don't like to be shut
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start leaking refrigerant after a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any effort to, or any problem,
spin this off into a commercial venture,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you need to feed funds back into the
installation of what growth chambers are?
[SPEAKER_00]: That question kind of almost leads into
whether we got a patent on this or not so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could start a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cornell sent people out here as soon
as that first prototype was built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did all the research and told me
it's not patentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm basically, I'd be open to anything
that gets us new chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Cornell wants to start a business,
it'd be fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That time has come and gone for me,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Approaching retirement age, I'm not ready
to start a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think my crew is that
interested in it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever we can do to help bring more
chambers here is fine with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_01]: In that one slide you showed for the
energy savings between the prototype and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the other chambers, it looks like
there's a significant savings there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is most of that the heat exchanger,
chilled water setup versus the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: refrigeration?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was just thinking if your three
versus seven-and-some million dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't take into account the savings in
energy, you're going to realize there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, for at least the ones that can look
after that kind of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two really should be added together
to get the full impact of what this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: An average gap between Hooterman versus
speaking of the same Bradfield room saying
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do the chilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't have to invest in a chiller in
this building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right behind that chamber room is chilled
water pipes that we could tap into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to start in Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just convincing people who might or
may not have the money at the current
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the sort of thing that can be put
into the construction itself if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: renovating the building?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had heard that they're going to
upgrade the infrastructure in this
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent a drawing off to those people
saying behind G12 Bradfield, could you
[SPEAKER_00]: insert a heat exchanger right there,
put a couple of valves in it that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: just tap into that when the time would
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could get the chilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was told that my drawing went on to
whoever is in charge of that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, all this is news to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a grungy old room in the
basement, BO6, that used to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers in it than it does now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've figured out that that room could
fit 11 chambers, not just this size,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the one with the double doors on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could fit 11 of those down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be perfect for a rabidopsis
research, where a lot of the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: that building are doing that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chilled water isn't far away from that
room, and we could bring it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Chris Smarton, I don't know about
that, seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this whole thing, she's not that
she's here, but this is something she'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in knowing about, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, let's thank Nick again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
