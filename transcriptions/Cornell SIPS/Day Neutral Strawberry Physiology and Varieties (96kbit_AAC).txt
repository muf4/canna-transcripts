[SPEAKER_00]: you expect to for them to continue pretty
well all the way through the summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get really cool areas like new list
card they just just keep going because it
[SPEAKER_00]: never gets too hot for them well that's
how I see it anyway the next thing run a
[SPEAKER_00]: production well oh one thing that has been
asked and I'll go back is that the terms
[SPEAKER_00]: day neutral June bearing what do they mean
well day neutral supposedly means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are indifferent to day length but
we can see that you have to get up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum temperatures before you can see
any difference so that has caused
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion in the in the terminology but
just think of it in terms of it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum temperature at which they initiate
and and then how they react to the day
[SPEAKER_00]: length okay run a production well runners
produce are produced more at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures more in longer day length
they are very day length sensitive day
[SPEAKER_00]: neutrals tend to have less than June
bearing varieties purely and simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're spending the effort
producing fruit rather than producing
[SPEAKER_00]: runners and to put on top of it it's
confounded by the ability to grow in short
[SPEAKER_00]: days basically when you look at the
strawberry varieties that are around in
[SPEAKER_00]: North America there are kind of two types
there are the California and Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties which have been genetically and
have used germplasm which has enabled
[SPEAKER_00]: those varieties to grow very successfully
in short days and then the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties which go dormant in short days
as a reaction to well it's winter we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get cold resistance we need to go to
sleep and they go dormant and down here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida you bring northern varieties down
here they literally stay dormant even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it's big enough to warm a bit it's
warm enough to grow and the Florida and
[SPEAKER_00]: California varieties grow very
successfully similarly the California
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida varieties will grow up in our area
in the northern areas but they tend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: have problems with winter hardiness so
probably the most good example of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to runner production is this work
from Derner and Company in 1984 where they
[SPEAKER_00]: put different June bearing and day neutral
varieties in growth chambers at different
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and on the left you can see
the day night temperatures they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at a four degree difference in practice I
think in North America it's probably a day
[SPEAKER_00]: night difference of around 12 degrees and
then they either grew them in short days
[SPEAKER_00]: or short days with a night interrupt this
is a plant physiology technique that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use to imitate long days but if you give
them a short period of low light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the night the strawberries think
they've had another day and it acts as if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in long days and that way you've
still got about the same amount of light
[SPEAKER_00]: energy involved but you've lengthened the
day from short to long and the short day
[SPEAKER_00]: plants under June bearing plants in the
short days didn't produce runners until it
[SPEAKER_00]: got warm when they had the night they
produce into long days they produced it
[SPEAKER_00]: much more but again you've got the
increase as the temperatures increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: day neutrals under short days produced
more runners again a little bit more and
[SPEAKER_00]: this I think is probably going back to
that ability to grow in short days which
[SPEAKER_00]: they've inherited from the California
material and when you put the night
[SPEAKER_00]: interrupts you again got the same pattern
but it kind of interesting to note that
[SPEAKER_00]: under the night interrupt the day neutrals
had less runners on average than the than
[SPEAKER_00]: the short day plants and so you know it
this is the classical response of day
[SPEAKER_00]: neutrals high temperature and long days I
know one grower in Ontario was growing his
[SPEAKER_00]: own runners and he said well I'm not
getting very many Adam I said well put a
[SPEAKER_00]: light night interrupt in and he did and
instead of getting five or six runners he
[SPEAKER_00]: got 20 or 30 so you know that day length
is crucial in terms of runner production
[SPEAKER_00]: so lastly heat acclimation well this is
the ability of the plant to adapt to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress and what have you there's
relatively little information out there on
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens in strawberries but we do
know that strawberries can acclimate and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some points here that I want to
make one is that they're able to acclimate
[SPEAKER_00]: and it varies considerably between the
species and the variety and we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that the cultivated strawberries
made up of two original species the
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginian from Eastern North America and
the Chilean from Chile and the west coast
[SPEAKER_00]: of North America and so all sorts of
things happen different things but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically if we talk in terms of further
synthesis it's interesting that you look
[SPEAKER_00]: in the literature and they say that if you
grow the plants below about 10 before you
[SPEAKER_00]: subject them to tests you get most further
synthesis happening between 15 and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius if on the other hand you grow them
at 20 to 30 degrees before you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: tests you can move the optimum up to 25 C
I recently was at a conference and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a gentleman from Switzerland talking
about how he'd tested it in the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: he found that the further synthesis in the
field in his plots was the highest rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: further synthesis was at 30 Celsius which
is kind of sort of higher than certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been led to think was what was
happening so obviously the plants are very
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptable in terms of that and that's nice
if in terms of day neutrals if 30 is the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum of further synthesis it means you
get really high yields and high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures then the other point that I
want to do is some talk about is skin
[SPEAKER_00]: color this is a comment that came up in
Ontario in terms of reclamation we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Cavendish and you get some summers where
Cavendish is nice red others where the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin's gone pale as if call it albinism or
whatever and it makes it pale and it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: unmarketable what's happening well we had
some studies and we ran seascape and honey
[SPEAKER_00]: eye in 12 hour days at two very different
temperatures of 30 degree day and 18
[SPEAKER_00]: degree night 18 degree day and 6 degree
night and we potted plants up and we grew
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the growth chambers from potting
all the way through to ripe fruit and we
[SPEAKER_00]: split them up into three periods the first
period which was from when we potted them
[SPEAKER_00]: up until they produced their first flowers
the second period was from first flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: when the fruit for the king fruit was
white and then from white fruit to fully
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe so what we do is put them in high
temperatures or low temperatures and
[SPEAKER_00]: switch them around at the different stages
so you've got plants that were always in
[SPEAKER_00]: high plants that were always in low and
then plants that were switched between
[SPEAKER_00]: high and low in the different combinations
and at the end one of the things that came
[SPEAKER_00]: about out of it was the observation on
what had happened to the skin color and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of interesting when you averaged
them out and this shows my representation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the averages under cold days cool
temperatures when the fruit was ripe you
[SPEAKER_00]: saw nice red ripe fruit and often and if
it was hot often the fruit went white that
[SPEAKER_00]: was at the ripe fruit stage the middle
stage it really didn't matter too much but
[SPEAKER_00]: what was interesting was when we went from
potted till first flower and we kept those
[SPEAKER_00]: under high temperatures we never saw any
of the white fruit of the white skin at
[SPEAKER_00]: the ripe fruit stage whereas if they were
cold kept in the cool when we got to the
[SPEAKER_00]: right to the right fruit stage we saw a
lot with with white fruit and for instance
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have high high and high and those
fruit were red whereas if you had low low
[SPEAKER_00]: and high that fruit was white so obviously
the plant was adapting at the very early
[SPEAKER_00]: stage in the growing season to acclimate
itself so that it was able to protect the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit when it was ripe and so when we
think about heat acclimation we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about processes that are happening a
long time before so is it a cold spring
[SPEAKER_00]: hot spring how's that going to affect
things anyway I've gone on long enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some of the things that I think
are important in terms of strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology in terms of day neutrals around
flower bud initiation run ring also has an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and I think we've only just started
to understand how heat will affect the day
[SPEAKER_00]: neutrals there's one last thing you've got
to remember is every variety will act
[SPEAKER_00]: differently from every other variety so
you have to learn your varieties as you go
[SPEAKER_04]: through okay thank you very much Adam I
think we'll hold questions to the end so
[SPEAKER_04]: that we can keep on track and so we're
going to shift to our second speaker who
[SPEAKER_04]: is miss Pam Fisher Pam is a bear crop
specialist for the Ontario Ministry of
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture Food and Rural Affairs based
in Simcoe Ontario she graduated from the
[SPEAKER_04]: University of Guelph where she studied
agriculture and entomology Pam works with
[SPEAKER_04]: growers researchers industry and other
MAFRA specialists to bring new technology
[SPEAKER_04]: and information to producers she is editor
of the Ontario berry grower newsletter and
[SPEAKER_04]: the Ontario fruit production
recommendations she delivers pest
[SPEAKER_04]: management training to berry crop scouts
in Ontario and is involved in field
[SPEAKER_04]: research and demonstration projects she
works very closely with the Ontario berry
[SPEAKER_04]: growers association and the North American
strawberry growers association Pam hello
[SPEAKER_03]: how are you good afternoon everybody I've
just been chatting away in the box there
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope you're you're ready to go on to
a new presentation I'm talking about day
[SPEAKER_03]: neutral strawberry varieties not because
I'm an expert at all but because I do see
[SPEAKER_03]: different varieties as I travel across the
province and listen to presentations in
[SPEAKER_03]: other areas so I hope you feel free to
comment on what I have to say about these
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and that we all learn something
first of all well Adam was talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: the terminology and did a good job of
explaining how day neutrals work some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the the terms I might use I thought I
would define strong day neutral for
[SPEAKER_03]: example would be something that seems to
set more flower buds at higher
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures and a weak day neutral may be
something that has gaps in production so I
[SPEAKER_03]: know Adam explained the real reason for
that but this is how I perceive it to be
[SPEAKER_03]: so I wanted you to have those terms when
handy when I'm referring to them later in
[SPEAKER_03]: this talk I also thought I'd start with
some examples of day neutral varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: from different breeding programs that I'm
not going to talk about today tribute and
[SPEAKER_03]: tri star were two of the early day neutral
varieties some of you may be familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: they were developed in the United States
the USDA for Eastern North America so they
[SPEAKER_03]: truly are adapted to the Northeast but
they're very vigorous plants and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: good yields the fruit is generally much
smaller than we would find acceptable
[SPEAKER_03]: these days although they may still have a
niche market for certain growers and these
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties tribute and tri star are
available still from some plant growers
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I listed some of the older day
neutral varieties from the University of
[SPEAKER_03]: California they have had a long history of
developing day neutrals and you may have
[SPEAKER_03]: heard of some of these varieties like fern
and selva aromas which were very popular
[SPEAKER_03]: in their day but are no longer widely
grown and finally I wanted to point out
[SPEAKER_03]: that there are several plant breeding
programs in Europe with day neutral
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that make their way to North
America typically a plant grower secures
[SPEAKER_03]: the rights to distribute these varieties
in North America and so you'll see in in
[SPEAKER_03]: catalogs from different plant growers day
neutral varieties that have been developed
[SPEAKER_03]: in North America and may find a place here
[SPEAKER_03]: so what I'm going to do is talk about the
three most important varieties that I see
[SPEAKER_03]: in North in Ontario and then I'll talk
about three relatively new varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: we tested last year so the first one and
by far the most popular is seascape this
[SPEAKER_03]: one was developed in the University of
California and made its way to farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: fields in approximately 1991 it's across
with selva which is an older day neutral
[SPEAKER_03]: variety and Douglas and seascape has been
very popular for a long time the fruit is
[SPEAKER_03]: good quality it's firm it's a medium long
conic and shape bright red it produces the
[SPEAKER_03]: best yields in August and early September
in our area and it's widely grown and the
[SPEAKER_03]: most winter hardy variety that we have of
the six that I'm talking about the fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: we know are flavorful but recently more
and more growers are telling me that it
[SPEAKER_03]: does seem to develop an intense and
sometimes unpleasant aroma in the heat of
[SPEAKER_03]: the summer and although I've never
experienced seascape with an objective
[SPEAKER_03]: objectionable taste I still love to eat
this fruit growers do tell me that
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to some of the other varieties
it's not as nice all see it all summer
[SPEAKER_03]: long another problem with seascape is that
it's very susceptible to powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: and this disease is not we're not used to
this disease on other June bearing
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties for example we don't see it as
often and on seascape not only does it
[SPEAKER_03]: attack the leaves which you can see in the
lower right here but it attacks the fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: and it attacks the blossom and so you can
end up with smaller fruit and blossom
[SPEAKER_03]: abortion sometimes and seeds that are very
that arrow isn't working seeds that are
[SPEAKER_03]: prominent on the fruit and some fruit
cracking sometimes that can be due to
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew so it's very susceptible to
mildew you need a really good spray
[SPEAKER_03]: program to keep on top of it and we are
limited in the fungicides that we can use
[SPEAKER_03]: at least in in Canada for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: another problem with seascape it's very
susceptible to rain damage so although it
[SPEAKER_03]: has high yields of nice large fruit often
after rain growers have to go through and
[SPEAKER_03]: throw away a lot of the fruit it's the
skin just sort of melts away after after a
[SPEAKER_03]: rain and the fruit is unmarketable a lot
of varieties do this but seascape does it
[SPEAKER_03]: quite badly and it's important to have a
well-shaped bed in a sloping bed to
[SPEAKER_03]: prevent some of that damage but but it is
susceptible to rain now throughout this
[SPEAKER_03]: talk I'm going to show you some graphs of
typical yield curves of these day neutral
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties in there in the first year after
planting and the graphs come from some
[SPEAKER_03]: data that we collected this summer funded
by the Ontario Berry Growers Association
[SPEAKER_03]: we put out five varieties of day neutrals
at a few different sites you can see on
[SPEAKER_03]: the map Bowmanville Woodstock Dunville and
Delhi and the graphs that I'm showing you
[SPEAKER_03]: all come from this site here in Woodstock
which is a fairly mild site compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern and Northern Ontario so this was
seascape harvest in 2010 at my Woodstock
[SPEAKER_03]: site we had small plots of five different
varieties and harvest them twice a week
[SPEAKER_03]: all through the season the plants were
planted the first of May week one is July
[SPEAKER_03]: 20th so that's when we began harvest in
week 12 was October the 7th so we
[SPEAKER_03]: harvested till almost or just after
Thanksgiving the other thing to notice
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see the same in all these graphs
that we we have the total marketable yield
[SPEAKER_03]: unmarketable yield and then the total
yield so the total yield is your blue line
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the brown line is what was
unmarketable and marketable is the purple
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that seascape is a fairly
early variety with very good yields high
[SPEAKER_03]: yields particularly throughout August and
early September but and I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see this on any of the other graphs
the unmarketable yield is sometimes higher
[SPEAKER_03]: than the marketable yield and that's not a
very good thing those berries could have
[SPEAKER_03]: been unmarketable because they were small
or because they had rain damage or because
[SPEAKER_03]: they were suffering from powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah that was Canadian Thanksgiving okay
so Albion is another very popular variety
[SPEAKER_03]: in Ontario most growers are trying Albion
and many growers have moved substantially
[SPEAKER_03]: away from seascape to to Albion especially
in the warmer parts of the province and
[SPEAKER_03]: the main reason is quality Albion is a
weak or moderate day neutral the yields
[SPEAKER_03]: are not as high as seascape but the
quality is very good it's a conical fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: bright red and shiny the skin is not
susceptible to bruising or rain damage and
[SPEAKER_03]: it has excellent excellent flavor also
Albion is more tolerant to powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: and more tolerant to spider mites than
seascape I should show you this too this
[SPEAKER_03]: this habit I think is fairly unique to
Albion where it ripens from the bottom the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom up so these are some of the things
we've observed with Albion Ontario very
[SPEAKER_03]: high percentage of marketable fruit even
though the yields are outstanding the the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest drawback I guess to to Albion is
well two drawbacks the yields are lower
[SPEAKER_03]: than seascape and winter hardiness could
be a problem it's definitely not as hardy
[SPEAKER_03]: as seascape if you overwinter the planting
most growers do overwinter day neutral
[SPEAKER_03]: plantings in Ontario and this is a field
of Albion taken it at the end of April and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that there are some some weak
areas some areas with strong plants I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to use this arrow sorry some areas
where the plants are stronger and then
[SPEAKER_03]: some areas up at the foreground here where
the plants are a little bit weaker and
[SPEAKER_03]: they can recover from this type of damage
but but in the end it is winter injury
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've noticed especially with Albion
but with other varieties as well that
[SPEAKER_03]: after the winter rose in the center of a
bed tend to be vigorous and more larger
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and less winter damage than the
rose on the outside edges near the edge of
[SPEAKER_03]: the bed and that's probably just due to a
cold effect where there's more cold coming
[SPEAKER_03]: into the bed from the edges these plants
do seem to recover quite well but they do
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't know what the effect of sublethal
winter injury could be so this is a graph
[SPEAKER_03]: of Albion harvest in 2010 at that same
site near Woodstock you can see that the
[SPEAKER_03]: peak of production is later than seascape
with week six being approximately August
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd so a lot of that yield came in after
after mid-August you can also see that the
[SPEAKER_03]: percent if you look at that purple line
the unmarketable fruit not the percent but
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount of unmarketable fruit is quite
low and consistently low throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: season and this is some some data
comparing the cultivar Albion to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar seascape at one of the most
northerly locations in Ontario in New
[SPEAKER_03]: Liskard where Becky Hughes does research
on strawberries and she shared this slide
[SPEAKER_03]: with me I thought you'd be interested to
see because it gives you some some numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: to compare the the yields of Albion to see
scape and I think also you can see the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of winter injury on the marketable
yield in the second year Becky says that
[SPEAKER_03]: that winter between 2008 and 2009 I think
was a fairly normal winter there was 15
[SPEAKER_03]: percent plant mortality in Albion after
that winter so it's really not as bad as
[SPEAKER_03]: you would expect for a condition for a
location as far north as New Liskard these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants would have been protected with
straw and a floating row cover for the
[SPEAKER_03]: winter but you can see that the yield the
second year and the berry size the second
[SPEAKER_03]: year is is quite a bit smaller than it was
the first year for both those varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: now the third variety that's still grown
in Ontario to some extent although not a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot is EV2 this is a variety from the
United Kingdom and people people like it
[SPEAKER_03]: because the plants are vigorous the fruit
is large it's light red and firm it's
[SPEAKER_03]: fairly round I think that most growers
really prefer to have the longer conical
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit if they're exporting or not
exporting if they're shipping their fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: to retail stores the flavor is sweet and
it is somewhat earlier than seascape so
[SPEAKER_03]: those are the advantages of EV2 however
the fruit is too soft for most for most
[SPEAKER_03]: markets off the farm and it is also very
susceptible to rain damage so there's not
[SPEAKER_03]: much EV2 grown in Ontario we are looking
forward to testing some of the newer
[SPEAKER_03]: siblings from this line of day neutrals in
the future so those were the three
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that I've seen grown widely in
Ontario seascape Albion a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: EV2 and now I'll talk about the three new
ones from California which are San
[SPEAKER_03]: Andreas, Monterey and Portola San Andreas
is a cross with Albion in the parentage
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a very large firm fruit with
excellent quality the shape is good it's
[SPEAKER_03]: medium to long conic and it's very highly
symmetrical in shape which helps it look
[SPEAKER_03]: great in a basket it's similar in season
to Albion and I think they selected it
[SPEAKER_03]: because yields are apparently higher than
Albion or at least they were higher in
[SPEAKER_03]: California we noticed that San Andreas is
a very attractive berry it's got a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: large calyx good flavor it was very late
for us but we've only tested it for one
[SPEAKER_03]: year and in a few locations in Ontario so
there could be physiological reasons why
[SPEAKER_03]: it was late it was much later than Albion
and it's supposed to come in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: season as Albion the plants for San
Andreas were really vigorous and I could
[SPEAKER_03]: see them across the field because they're
so disease resistant so where we could see
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew and other leaf diseases on
all the other varieties San Andreas was
[SPEAKER_03]: remarkably clean it is however susceptible
to botrytis and this is the yield curve
[SPEAKER_03]: for San Andreas just one year like I said
of harvest in in southern Ontario it had
[SPEAKER_03]: very high yields but they didn't really
start until the end of August and early
[SPEAKER_03]: September and you can see that the
unmarketable yield was fairly low and
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently low the third the second new
cultivar out of California released at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time also with Albion in the
parentage is Monterey and this one is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the most similar of the three to
Albion and it was released also because it
[SPEAKER_03]: has apparently higher yields in Albion
it's got large red fruit kind of an
[SPEAKER_03]: orangey red fruit and and vigorous plants
we noticed that the size and the yield of
[SPEAKER_03]: this variety were good and that the flavor
was good but the quality is not what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: used to if you've grown Albion so the skin
seems a little bit thinner seems a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more susceptible to rain damage maybe a
little more susceptible to leaf diseases
[SPEAKER_03]: and fruit rots still it's a fine variety
if you can't get your hands on Albion I
[SPEAKER_03]: would give Monterey a try and this is the
yield curve for Monterey earlier than some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the others we've seen and fairly
productive with high yields and reasonably
[SPEAKER_03]: the unmarketable fruit is a little bit
higher than San Andreas and Albion but not
[SPEAKER_03]: terribly so
[SPEAKER_03]: finally Portola another cross from the
University of California released at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time it's it's touted as being a
strong day neutral which means you
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't see so many gaps in production
and you would expect it to come in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit earlier in Ontario which it
does the fruit is a much oranger red,
[SPEAKER_03]: orangier red than the others it's a bit
rounder in shape with a small calyx and we
[SPEAKER_03]: saw high early yields with Portola it is
definitely an earlier berry than the other
[SPEAKER_03]: than most of the others the fruit does
have a kind of an unusual color to it it's
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's the gloss or the
shine or the color it wasn't so rain
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerant as Albion and my students did not
like the taste now they'd been spoiled on
[SPEAKER_03]: Albion in this slide I think shows it is
easy to pick out the color and the
[SPEAKER_03]: appearance of Portola this is a basket of
fruit with several varieties in the basket
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can see on the lower right that's
where all the Portola are they are they're
[SPEAKER_03]: much oranger kind of duller and almost
plastic in color but they would put up a
[SPEAKER_03]: very attractive pack for wholesale markets
and this is the yield curve for Portola I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it has fairly fairly high
unmarketable yields but also fairly high
[SPEAKER_03]: yields altogether and you can see that it
was much earlier than than some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: other varieties coming in at week three
which was third of August as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: week five and six for some of the others
[SPEAKER_03]: this graph is just one to show the size of
the berries in these trials at this at
[SPEAKER_03]: this location throughout the summer I
think the thing to notice here is that
[SPEAKER_03]: Seascape had the smaller fruit and Albion,
Monterey, Portola were all very similar in
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit size and the San Andreas may be a
tiny bit bigger some times of the year
[SPEAKER_03]: so and I'm about ready to wrap up and
maybe we'll have time for some discussion
[SPEAKER_03]: but I hope I've given you some points on
on choosing a variety I think it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: than just yield for day neutrals although
yield is still an important consideration
[SPEAKER_03]: Albion has really set the stage for flavor
and people have turned to Albion away from
[SPEAKER_03]: Seascape for that reason the quality of
fruit is important how much fruit are you
[SPEAKER_03]: going to throw away for poor quality or
rain damage I think disease resistance is
[SPEAKER_03]: important if a variety is so susceptible
to disease that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble controlling it with our limited
toolbox and we'll have to see what happens
[SPEAKER_03]: with winter hardiness so Seascape is
definitely a hardier variety for most of
[SPEAKER_03]: Ontario more hardy than Albion the
advantage to these new varieties Monterey,
[SPEAKER_03]: Portola and San Andreas may be that
they're a little more hardy than Albion
[SPEAKER_03]: and we need some more experience in the
northeast to find that out and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: just my favorite slide of somebody with
day neutral varieties in in Ontario and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really proud to work with growers that
grow such beautiful fruit thank you very
[SPEAKER_04]: much Pam, Adam if you'll join us again if
anyone has any questions you're welcome to
[SPEAKER_04]: type them into the chat box and either of
our speakers will reply while we're
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting for those I'm going to move to the
end screen thank you all for joining us
[SPEAKER_04]: this week our second presentation will be
next week in the day neutral strawberry
[SPEAKER_04]: mini series we're going to be hearing
about day neutral growing systems for Mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon Paron who's the president of Nova
Fruit and we'll also be hearing about
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility and fertigation from John
Zanstra from the University of Guelph
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a question from Ian McGregor Pam
how much earlier is EV2 than Seascape?
Pam?
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yes I was typing the answer but I guess
I could answer it yes with my mic yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: anyways hi Ian I haven't compared them I
think it's about a week earlier to get
[SPEAKER_03]: into big bigger production and I wonder if
anyone else has experience with EV2
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to Seascape I don't also I'm
interested in knowing if who else has
[SPEAKER_03]: tried some of these newer varieties and
what their experience is while we're
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting for people to weigh in on that
Michelle and Norbert have a question about
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that would be suited to Edmonton
and the north
[SPEAKER_00]: ooh Edmonton and the north the day
neutrals would be suitable there's a quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a large acreage of day neutrals in Alberta
and there has been for a long time a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers have been growing fern fern and
also Seascape would be okay don't you
[SPEAKER_02]: think Adam a good one to try yeah Rob
Black is on maybe Rob can tell us what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing in Alberta otherwise you
look at the June berries my standard
[SPEAKER_00]: advice is you've got to try them and see I
know that our recent varieties Seascape
[SPEAKER_00]: and Serenity did very well in Charles and
in Manitoba you mean Sapphire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sapphire yeah sorry I'm getting all the
S's mixed up
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know again you've got to try them
in your environment thank you David David
[SPEAKER_04]: commented David Handley from Maine has
commented that EV2 was seven to ten days
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier than Seascape in some years and
then in others only three to five days
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you Rob Rob has a lot of experience
with day neutrals in Alberta and so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: confirming that it would be a good one to
try
[SPEAKER_03]: but it also depends to the people up near
Edmonton whether you're going to grow them
[SPEAKER_03]: as an annual or whether you want to have
them for two years well there's been some
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess yeah but there's been some very
good research out of Saskatchewan that has
[SPEAKER_00]: shown that if you cover them with plastic
you can get them through you can get most
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries through the winter very very
easily in those climates yeah that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: Becky's doing in New Liskard covering with
straw and plastic or in row cover growing
[SPEAKER_00]: systems of day neutrals and high tunnels
oh it's plastic Laura's asking is it
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic or row cover it's plastic not row
cover although I think Becky's using row
[SPEAKER_00]: cover yeah but the research was done on
plastic in tunnels I tend to my feeling on
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels is that in most areas it's not
going to be economic because of the price
[SPEAKER_00]: you get for the berries but temper that
with I think if you are in an area where
[SPEAKER_00]: in the north where you have a very short
growing season the day new tunnels can
[SPEAKER_00]: make could be very profitable and we're
doing some research with Becky it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: the day neutrals under tunnels now in
Liskard and I think that in that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: area it could be a very profitable
enterprise but certainly come down into
[SPEAKER_00]: southern Ontario and anywhere down so
further than that the economics aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work having said that here in
Florida they're starting to put tunnels up
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy because in the winter they get
very very good high early season yields
[SPEAKER_00]: but then again that's in a cool growing
season and that's pushing the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: up when you get into northern areas and
you have tunnels the temperature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels is higher and it suppresses the
the yield and the flowerbed in initiation
[SPEAKER_00]: so no I think it's very regionally
sensitive if you like as to whether
[SPEAKER_04]: tunnels will work or won't there's a
question from John Brandstrader best
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties for southern Ohio heat he's
asking well I would suggest I'll be in for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure because seascape does tend to develop
those off flavors in the heat of the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer not really off flavors but less
flavorful than Albion but will Albion gap
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher in southern Ohio I suspect it
will it could we didn't see much of a gap
[SPEAKER_02]: this year when it was quite hot but I
guess it wasn't as hot as most years it
[SPEAKER_00]: depends when when the heat is BAM if the
heats early it will gap if it's the heats
[SPEAKER_00]: later it was already set its flower buds
and if there's a gap it'll sort of catch
[SPEAKER_00]: itself back up over the winter so yeah in
terms of fruit quality I think Albion
[SPEAKER_00]: would be better in Ohio than seascape but
I I wonder about the gapping so maybe an
[SPEAKER_02]: EV2 would probably be too soft way too
soft so maybe try some Portola because it
[SPEAKER_02]: had great great quality the flavor wasn't
good for us but the flavor could change
[SPEAKER_00]: with the region there's a story try them
and see are there any other questions it
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like there may be one or two more
thank you all for participating today
[SPEAKER_04]: really appreciate your patience we had a
few issues with audio but for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part I think it went well summer
temperatures in Ontario well in southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario you can get days in the low 30s
and sometimes in August nights in the low
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 to 28 Celsius once you get further
north again you can you can get a few days
[SPEAKER_00]: into that into the 30s but by and large
temperatures are much lower it just
[SPEAKER_00]: depends where you are because Ontario is a
big province how does Albion yield in the
[SPEAKER_00]: second season well Suncrow's had very good
years with it luck with it in on southern
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario again it depends where you are
about 30% less than seascape yeah every
[SPEAKER_03]: every year yeah about 30 35% less than
seascape and then with the winter damage
[SPEAKER_02]: if you had winter damage which isn't as
severe as we're waiting for the big winter
[SPEAKER_02]: to to sort out these varieties they
haven't had a good test but if the if
[SPEAKER_03]: there was winter damage you may lose a lot
of that early yield on Albion like maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% but I think it would catch back up
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I was thinking I was wondering about
what Kevin's comment about is your
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction between varieties marketable
yield I would say my gut feeling is that
[SPEAKER_00]: Albion has more marketable yield than
seascape and that you'd lose in seascape
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd lose marketable yield to
unmarketable yield what spacings do we use
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going four rows on a diagonal
pattern on a bed foot apart between the
[SPEAKER_02]: rows a foot apart between the plants the
trials in Woodstock were two row bed but
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 by 12 inch spacing you don't need eight
inches is the absolute minimum you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go within the row anything and then that's
tight and you will increase your yields
[SPEAKER_00]: but that will give you a lower yield per
plant the tighter you get so it's a sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of balance between yield per acre versus
yield per plant all right then thank you
[SPEAKER_04]: very much Pam and Adam thank you everyone
for participating and we will be back with
[SPEAKER_04]: you again next week thanks Kathy thank you
bye bye now you
