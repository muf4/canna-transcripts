[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if I did this the wrong way,
you might say I did because I listened to
[SPEAKER_03]: Frank Rossi when I said I was giving this
seminar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Frank said, not a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put a few jokes in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm following his advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it goes awry, don't blame me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what I was going to do is
really just give a good overview of the
[SPEAKER_03]: types of data that go into climate
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And working with Dave and a number of
people here at Allen, that always comes
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we getting this data from?
[SPEAKER_03]: The observed data, the data from the past,
the current data that we use, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: more importantly, as we move on to it,
the data we're going to use in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of a little bit of
background about my slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just kind of going over the
contents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really here, the middle part is going to
be kind of short changed, but the first
[SPEAKER_03]: part and the last part is where I'm going
to focus most of my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to focus it on the first part in
this kind of intriguing bullet here,
[SPEAKER_03]: climate game.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone know the whole scandal of
emails in the research lab in East Anglia
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to shed a little bit of
light on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, the bottom line in all of that
is climate data have been collected for a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of years, hundreds of years,
100 years at least, but never with the
[SPEAKER_03]: intent of monitoring climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's basically a data set that's out
there, it's been used for other purposes,
[SPEAKER_03]: had its roots pretty much in agriculture,
and it's only now recently that we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: using these data to monitor climate
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has some implications to it,
and hopefully I'll bring that out in some
[SPEAKER_03]: of my talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then really in the end, what we have
to boil down to is we're trying to project
[SPEAKER_03]: these climate parameters into the future,
100 years into the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, how can we go about
doing that at the scale that is just
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the models we operate on are these
big, big global climate models that have
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of one observation for an area about
the size of New York, but yet we're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in will we be able to grow
grapes in the Finger Lakes in 2100,
[SPEAKER_03]: or will this crop do well in New York,
and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there it's a matter of getting the size
just right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really the whole backbone of the climate
network, observed climate network in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States is something that's called
the Historical Climatology Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to use the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: as an example, but this is a good example
for pretty much anywhere else in the world
[SPEAKER_03]: where there is an extensive set of
observed meteorological data going back
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most in Europe, same thing in China and
Russia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really these types of issues and things
are things that come up in all of the
[SPEAKER_03]: networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a little over a thousand
stations in this network to cover the size
[SPEAKER_03]: of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: The resolution of these data is primarily
daily, so not hourly data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really it's measuring three things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The daily maximum temperature,
the daily minimum temperature,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how much rainfall, the daily
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the 100 year record we're
really applying to these measurements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many stations, almost all of them,
have 50 year records.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some have more than 100 years records.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said before, never intended to
really track climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of just to put this into
perspective, the historical climate
[SPEAKER_03]: network is pretty much the cream of the
cream of these stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at any old station,
there's about today, about 6,000,
[SPEAKER_03]: 8,000, somewhere in there depending on
where we are, stations that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: record these observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I use a rain gauge as an example,
if I took every rain gauge that was
[SPEAKER_03]: operational in the United States today and
put them rim to rim, okay, anyone want to
[SPEAKER_03]: venture a guess how big of an area that
would cover?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone want to have a bet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Square bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil is closer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tennis court.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take every rain gauge in the U.S.,
put them rim to rim, we got a tennis
[SPEAKER_03]: court.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of gives you an idea of what
we're dealing with here to measure climate
[SPEAKER_03]: change or anything on a national scale.
There's the distribution of these
stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much have good coverage across the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sparse in some of the areas you
would expect them to be sparse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, a pretty good coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of what a typical station
looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Game Farm Road station.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, a few extra instruments here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main ones are this rain gauge here
with a windshield around it and two
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature sensors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk about that a little bit
more later.
[SPEAKER_03]: The primary sensor is this one right here
which is called the max-min temperature
[SPEAKER_03]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: historical climate network is it's citizen
science in action.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been citizen science forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are pretty much in people's
backyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is an example of a station.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know which one it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the historical climate network,
the rain gauge is out of the frame,
[SPEAKER_03]: but here's the MMTS.
[SPEAKER_03]: The network also expands to some airport
stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the temperature sensor at
Binghamton, which is part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, these are volunteer
networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weather service is supplying the
instrumentation, but the volunteer is
[SPEAKER_03]: supplying the manpower.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some bad apples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really the crux of climate
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example of an MMTS that's
kind of in some bushes and right by a big
[SPEAKER_03]: asshole parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the best exposure for measuring
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an even worse exposure for
measuring temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a burn barrel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that bomb looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a fair number of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a really bad exposure here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the temperature sensor up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't need to be a
climatologist to figure out that these are
[SPEAKER_03]: not good locations for measuring
temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, these few bad apples,
I mean, these are just the bad examples
[SPEAKER_03]: that I picked out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want to say is they don't spoil the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we actually go out and look at these
stations, okay, and it's kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the sad part about it is when
these stations were selected to be in the
[SPEAKER_03]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Climate Network, probably about 30 years
ago, 20 years ago, nobody went out and
[SPEAKER_03]: looked at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at the length of record.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at the amount of missing data.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never looked at the sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why these bad apples are in the
bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we look at this, basically the
blue line is a temperature trend over the
[SPEAKER_03]: last 50 or so years from the good
stations, the best stations, the cream of
[SPEAKER_03]: the crops, the Ithicas, the stations that
are in nice, pristine environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: The red line is all of the stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we take all of the stations,
the bad apples in all, and what we can see
[SPEAKER_03]: is that really those few bad apples make
some difference in the exact numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, if we're looking at the
trend, we have the same pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: magnitude and pattern trend through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when these scientists from East Anglia
were criticized for taking some data out
[SPEAKER_03]: of their analyses, what they were actually
doing was separating out the bad apples
[SPEAKER_03]: that occur not only here, but across the
globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have taken examples of stations
like this from any country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, they are the exceptions rather than
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data are processed in a number of
different ways, and they're processed to
[SPEAKER_03]: remove non-climatic things that creep into
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty much the easiest things are
things like quality control and missing
[SPEAKER_03]: data and urbanization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically here, a very simple adjustment
on the raw data to adjust for populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like a growing city where
population is changing gets adjusted.
[SPEAKER_03]: That warming due to urbanization is
removed from the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, quality control is really my
Walgreens sign.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not 500 and 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, this is probably a common
error.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it in mind, up until very recently,
these things were keyed in from paper
[SPEAKER_03]: form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the observer went out to the station,
wrote down a number, sent in his form or
[SPEAKER_03]: her form at the end of the month,
and somebody digitized these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very easy that 50.1 got keyed in
as 50 or 500 and 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stations are adjusted for relocations.
This is the current Ithaca station.
This is the Ithaca station in 1930.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the temperature shelter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone know what building that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Robert's Hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the roof of Robert's Hall was the
official observation site in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of other stuff up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, if you look at the Ithaca record,
the record highs in Ithaca are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a black roof on the top of Robert's
Hall.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot different here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about at the same level now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of, if you want to think of
climate change that way, the roof of
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert's Hall and Gamefront Road are about
even.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, back here, Ithaca was an
official weather service station.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a weather bureau office in
Robert's Hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a, this thing up here is
actually the signal flags.
[SPEAKER_03]: They throw up a flag, you know,
you see a hurricane flag or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that flying.
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be one of those on the roof
of Robert's Hall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data are adjusted for a change in
instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, prior to the mid-1980s,
the temperatures were taken by a maximum
[SPEAKER_03]: and minimum thermometer liquid and glass
enclosed in the Stevenson screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the mid-1980s, most of the stations,
not all of them, moved on to an electric
[SPEAKER_03]: sensor here, which is a thermocouple
inside the MMTS.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, for the last 100 years,
these are the only two types of
[SPEAKER_03]: instruments that have been used.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data are also adjusted for observation
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are once-a-day observations of
maximum and minimum temperature taken by
[SPEAKER_03]: volunteers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm an early riser, and for me,
it might be easier to take my observation
[SPEAKER_03]: in the morning before I come into work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I were doing that, and this is my
example of a morning observation,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I was coming in and, say, I took my
observation at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I took my observation at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: on this morning, I would be looking at the
lowest temperature in this 24-hour period,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just so happened to occur right
when I took the observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this value is a little bit colder than
that value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my mink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I reset my thermometer, can only go to the
minimum temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't make it any more colder or any
more warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I come back the next day,
and throughout this whole period,
[SPEAKER_03]: the temperature has risen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I take my observation here,
say, what was the minimum temperature in
[SPEAKER_03]: the last 24 hours?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I take my observations in the
morning, I tend to count a particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: cold morning twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm the opposite and rather do it when
I come home from work, I have the opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I now take my observation at the time of
day, and whoops, looks like Mac and PC got
[SPEAKER_03]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were supposed to be lined up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take my observation at the time when the
temperature is the warmest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I came and I looked at this period
of time, this would be my max,
[SPEAKER_03]: not that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if I came the next day at 5 p.m.,
I would be counting that max twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same type of thing, but in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the morning observers tend to have a
cold bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: The afternoon observers tend to have a
warm bias.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this wouldn't be a problem if
observers were random.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there has been a systematic shift
through time to take morning observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been an artificial cooling in
the climate record due to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, this adjustment is pretty easy
to figure out, and it's a pretty robust
[SPEAKER_03]: adjustment, knowing what the observation
time is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some trends in the HCN.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, what is the difference as
we add each of these adjustments?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the green line is just if we fill in
missing data, and it's nothing really
[SPEAKER_03]: there to write home about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The red line is the instrument adjustment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is when we shifted from a cotton
region shelter to an MMTS in the mid-80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, that caused a very
slight warm bias to the record,
[SPEAKER_03]: the record warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or our adjustment had to be toward
warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I said that backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bias is actually cooling, and this is
the adjustment that we needed to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at the change in observation
time, again, a systematic shift to morning
[SPEAKER_03]: observations is a cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our adjustment, we have to add warming
to the record.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you can see the magnitude of
this is on the order of degrees F,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately, but about a third of a
degree apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: The station moves, again, the adjustment
is towards warming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for this is through time,
there's been a systematic shift in having
[SPEAKER_03]: stations in the center of a city,
and then moving them out to an airport
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Baltimore might be a good example where
the station used to be in the courthouse
[SPEAKER_03]: in the center of Baltimore, and it got
moved out to the airport.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, in this case, that's a big enough
move that it counts as two stations,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that gives you the general flavor of
these moves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a cooling, or actually the
Ithaca example is a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another systematic shift was from rooftop
locations to ground locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there again, the cooling in the record
that has to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Urbanization, of course, has the opposite
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: In here, this population adjustment is
about a tenth of a degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really the biggest difference there is
the observation time and the station
[SPEAKER_03]: moves, which together are about a half
degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't quite understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a maximum minimum thermometer,
either automatic or one that you can read
[SPEAKER_02]: the minimum temperature on, it doesn't
matter when the temperature is taken,
[SPEAKER_02]: does it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's this bias thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't quite get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, because they're not electronic
thermometers like a data logger where you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what everything is at every hour or
every minute of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, the best analogy I can give
to the liquid and glass thermometers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they continue that in the electronic
thermometers, it's like a fever thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you take your temperature with a fever
thermometer, if it's 103, you pull it out
[SPEAKER_03]: of your mouth, it's 103, and it stays at
103 until you shake it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these thermometers work exactly the
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It records the highest temperature that
has been recorded since you have reset it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then why wouldn't you go to
something more often
[SPEAKER_02]: than you read it?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and the whole reason there is
primarily the federal government is broke
[SPEAKER_03]: and devoid on technology, or they're
working on anticipated technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other reason, too, is you have
this big, long record, a 100-year record
[SPEAKER_03]: of doing it one way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The current technology of electronic
thermometers, when the observer goes out
[SPEAKER_03]: to Game Farm Road, there is a readout that
basically says, what was the highest
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature that was recorded in the last
24 hours, and what was the coolest,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been moves, and we'll see,
to get away from that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, this is my, I forget what it
was, time's passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature record from measurements like
this very much mirrors the global record.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we see the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: record, kind of a flat period in through
the 40s, excuse me, a rise from the 1900s
[SPEAKER_03]: to about the 1940s, a decrease to about
the 1970s, an increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see the same type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a different scale here,
but here's my rise from the 1900s to about
[SPEAKER_03]: 1940, my kind of decrease or flat period
in through the 70s, and then my rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: record is a good match to the global
record in looking at these observed
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, the present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, last five years or so,
Noah said, hey, we need to do something to
[SPEAKER_03]: really monitor climate change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a network that really does this,
and they've instituted what is called the
[SPEAKER_03]: Climatological Reference Network.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about 100 stations across the U
.S., given by the yellow dots,
[SPEAKER_03]: one up here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: The layout of these dots was done very
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were involved in some of the work to
say, what is the minimum stations we can
[SPEAKER_03]: put out in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a good measure of what the
temperature trend has been?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so a lot of, actually, the sighting
of these stations as the spacing between
[SPEAKER_03]: these stations is scientifically based.
[SPEAKER_03]: A CRN station looks like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one out at the Animal Science
Facility in Hartford, and there's one down
[SPEAKER_03]: at Millbrook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the Climate Center was involved
in sighting these stations, and it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: real bear, particularly in the Northeast,
because one of the requirements of these
[SPEAKER_03]: stations, and there was a whole review
process, is that the area around the
[SPEAKER_03]: station could not be expected to change
for 50 years, so we wanted to have Game
[SPEAKER_03]: Farm Road be one of these stations,
but when we went, one of the review
[SPEAKER_03]: processes was looking at, okay,
what is Cornell's plans for expansion?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way they planned on expanding,
so that automatically nixed that,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we were able to do that out in
Hartford, and this was really hard in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northeast because, number one,
it couldn't be on private land.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always had to be on public land,
so we actually had a nice facility out,
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody by the venture army, George Jr. I
thought that would be a great location for
[SPEAKER_03]: a site, but George Jr. isn't private land.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's privately held land, so that got
nixed, so really hard, especially in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northeast, to site these stations,
but anyway, rain gauge in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: electronic sensors there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually three redundant sensors
all looking at the same thing actually
[SPEAKER_03]: within this, measuring solar radiation,
measuring wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things to see if things are
out of whack between the sensors,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they really did this upright to really
monitor climate into the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like five minute data,
Chris, so now we don't have this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, increasingly, a lot of the...
So locally, did they try to avoid lake
[SPEAKER_04]: effect sites?
[SPEAKER_03]: The criteria for siting these,
yes, they did, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of argument of where you put
something along the coast, but as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: the coast reflected that trend in the
temperature or it needed to, those
[SPEAKER_03]: stations were looked at, and how much did
that affect the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: trend, there was some siting there,
but most of them are actually been away
[SPEAKER_03]: from large bodies of water, rather,
the criteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Increasingly now, our observations
globally, U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: are coming from remotely sensed platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a nice satellite record going
back from the end of the 70s, and really
[SPEAKER_03]: what I'm trying to show here is the blue
is surface observations, and a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: different satellite platforms,
and here the trends, if you can make them
[SPEAKER_03]: out, are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The slope is different, but yet the same
type of an increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just because they're satellites,
these same types of problems that creep
[SPEAKER_03]: into station data also creep into
satellite.
[SPEAKER_03]: The satellite orbits degrade through time,
and that has to be adjusted for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Changes in atmospheric moisture might
affect the satellite record.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because it's coming from a
satellite doesn't mean it's devoid of
[SPEAKER_03]: these types of things that go on in the
surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And increasingly for rainfall,
radar is becoming a platform for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a lot of our information,
and this is really kind of my transition
[SPEAKER_03]: in going from global circulation models to
observations, a lot of our observations is
[SPEAKER_03]: we use a data set that's called the
re-analysis, and the best way to describe
[SPEAKER_03]: a re-analysis is it takes all kinds,
basically data from any number of
[SPEAKER_03]: platforms, radio zones, weather balloons,
aircraft, surface observations,
[SPEAKER_03]: satellite, how clouds are moving to get an
idea of the wind, and these are the data
[SPEAKER_03]: that go into initializing weather forecast
models.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have a gridded model to predict
tomorrow's weather, I need to give it its
[SPEAKER_03]: initial conditions, and these are the
types of data that go into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what has been done is going back 30 or
even in some cases 50 years to take the
[SPEAKER_03]: observations that go into initializing
these forecasts, put them through a
[SPEAKER_03]: standardized routine so the routine
doesn't change through time, and then come
[SPEAKER_03]: up with a gridded data set that blends all
of these platforms together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's giving me things like
precipitation, it's giving me things like
[SPEAKER_03]: surface temperature, but it's also giving
me things like wind speed and pressures
[SPEAKER_03]: and heights and where the highs and lows
are, much like a global circulation model
[SPEAKER_03]: does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this re-analysis data set sort of is
going to, or it does, provide a benchmark
[SPEAKER_03]: to global circulation models, and I'll
show that in some of my later slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, what is a climate model?
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting to the title of my talk,
if I can't get the weather right tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do I get the climate right in 100
years?
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, in a climate model,
we have to take this whole big climate
[SPEAKER_03]: system, the atmosphere, the sun,
the volcanoes, the oceans, the ice,
[SPEAKER_03]: the greenhouse gases, the clouds,
the agriculture and the land surface,
[SPEAKER_03]: and basically turn that into a model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though that's a nice picture,
whoops, there it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I'm taking all of that and
turning it into a lot of compute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, that is the crux of the
climate model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to go through a couple of
equations, but not too many.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, what do I want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have lava lamps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think, again, it's just an
analogy I was trying to think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think anybody can say, if I turn on the
lava lamp, what's going to happen to the
[SPEAKER_03]: lava?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to rise in the lamp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the basic physics of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm heating the lava from the bottom and
it's rising.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I asked a different question,
how big is each blabba lava as it rises?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or predict when this guy rises,
the next one rises, how big is it going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's going to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more like the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or an example I usually do, I don't have
it, if I drop the piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I asked you to model what was going to
happen to the paper if I let go,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd all say it's going to fall to the
floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I asked you where it was going to land,
every time I drop it, it's going to land
[SPEAKER_03]: someplace different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the chaos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be somewhere that's
different and nobody's going to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, here in the climate,
my example is, yes, we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_03]: if we add greenhouse gases, what is the
overall trend going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, what we don't expect the model
to get are these inter-annual variations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The model doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The model might replicate El Nino.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the model has no idea in what year an
El Nino is going to occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe in 100 years, the model will get
it right and they'll be in El Nino every
[SPEAKER_03]: seven years, or at the historical rate of
El Ninos.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not going to occur,
you can't look at the model and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, the model is predicting an El Nino in
2060.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't expect that to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you wouldn't see where I'm trying to
get at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're getting the overall trend,
but the timing of these types of swiggles
[SPEAKER_03]: is not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't expect it to be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A good example of that is the last several
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the last 10 years, if you look at a
trend, it's been cooling or flat.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will say, oh, climate change is
over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: That cooling part is we're in one of these
valleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, it will come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the model is trying to get the overall
trend, the gross aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be expected to get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Models are gridded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the whole globe is divided into
a number of grid boxes, kind of on
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution changes with time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much state of the art now is maybe
100 kilometers on the side, a degree by a
[SPEAKER_03]: degree maybe is a good-sized global
circulation model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grid boxes go up into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grid boxes go down into the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea is each of these grid boxes
is a node in the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's one value for each of these
grid boxes, one value for temperature,
[SPEAKER_03]: one value for elevation, you name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the models, and there are a number
of different climate models out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any number of climate groups has their own
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, all of these models share pretty
much a common set of four physical
[SPEAKER_03]: equations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to conserve momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to serve, in a special case,
momentum in the vertical through the
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrostatic equation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to conserve mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to conserve energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the equation of state needs to apply
to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the crux of all these models,
this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the core equations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we won't go into those too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really where the art comes into state
of the art, the climate model,
[SPEAKER_03]: is through how things are parameterized.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we take care of things that occur
at a scale that is smaller than the grid
[SPEAKER_03]: scale of the model?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here a good example, and maybe not a
good example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't get a good picture here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where clouds really matter is at the scale
of the individual drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I look at a cloud, or if you sit in on
my cloud physics class, whether a cloud is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to reflect solar radiation or allow
solar radiation to pass through or absorb
[SPEAKER_03]: long wave radiation really depends on what
are the sizes of the drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the sizes of the drops are like
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on a small scale here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, what is the density of
those drops?
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are things that are on many
orders of magnitude smaller scale that the
[SPEAKER_03]: model is able to take into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, we have about a degree by a
degree box.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to say it's cloudy or it's not
cloudy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those types of things need to be
parameterized into the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, kind of simple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the relative humidity in the model over
the grid box reaches a certain level,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's cloudy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This cloud has this albedo in it based on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a number of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how one model makes a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why my answer might come out to
be different than somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a spread of solutions going
into the future, mainly due to how these
[SPEAKER_03]: are parameterized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's been a whole evolution
through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only these FAR, SAR, TAR are the ITCC
reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the first assessment report,
the second, the fourth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, I guess they needed to do
something because the fourth and the fifth
[SPEAKER_03]: were both going to be FAR.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you can see the size of the
grid boxes are going from about 500
[SPEAKER_03]: kilometers on the side in the first
assessment report to about 100 kilometers
[SPEAKER_03]: on the side now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way things are parameterized in the
models has changed dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the 70s, there were no clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was enough water in the
atmosphere, it rained out and that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No clouds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even here in the 70s, there was no ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just a lot of water and water
was allowed to evaporate, but there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: current.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no deep circulation in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the ocean was a source of water vapor
for the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, as we get into the
recent period of time, we got a really
[SPEAKER_03]: sophisticated model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an ocean with a circulation,
deep circulation, surface circulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Atmospheric chemistry is starting to be
modeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vegetation at the surface starts to
interact and is dynamic, not just static
[SPEAKER_03]: through time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a whole evolution in how these models
have come about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And primarily, the thing that's going on
here is an increase in computing power,
[SPEAKER_03]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on through this, the models have
been pushing the available computer power.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of going back to how well my
models are doing, if you remember the
[SPEAKER_03]: observations, and these are the global
observations, we have this period of time
[SPEAKER_03]: from 1900 to 1920 where the temperature
rises, a cooling in through the 40s
[SPEAKER_03]: through the 70s, and then a rise again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have kind of this zigzag pattern
pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what happens when we try to
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the nice things about a climate
model is we can play games with the
[SPEAKER_03]: climate model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can, in some ways, play dodge.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can add greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take away greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make volcanoes erupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can not make volcanoes erupt.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make the sun brighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can make the sun thinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do all of these things and see how
that impacts what the output of the model
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's an example, again, of my zigzag
of temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a climate model that is run with the
only change through this period of time is
[SPEAKER_03]: the change in the greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the greenhouse gases in the model are
changed according to what has been
[SPEAKER_03]: observed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we can see, this red line is the
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really doesn't match very well with the
observed pattern that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through here, the trend is about
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're offset.
[SPEAKER_03]: Misses this cooling totally, and not
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big match.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case, keep the greenhouse gases
constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing changed in the model is
the change in the natural forces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, basically, volcanic eruptions
and changes in the solar intensity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we look at that, well, if you
notice the model here, again, in the red,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of matches a little bit better here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts to match a little bit better
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have this rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, we put it all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have the observations in black and kind of
my general trends in blue, the model in
[SPEAKER_03]: red.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see that the model, at least in my
view, matches the observations fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're able to capture this warming in the
early part of the record.
[SPEAKER_03]: That probably has nothing to do or very
little to do with greenhouse gases,
[SPEAKER_03]: but has everything to do with the sun
being brighter and there being a lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: volcanic eruptions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get this cooling fairly well in through
here, 50s.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sulfate aerosols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Burning dirty coal, acid rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the aerosols that we emit when
we burn coal are reflective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they reduce the amount of incoming
solar radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, on this global scale,
we have a cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we get into the 70s,
this is the large increase in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: gases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very little to do with natural variations
in this period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also at a time when we've been
cleaning up the coals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sulfate aerosols are becoming less and
less and less in most parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: not all parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, my example here of a climate
model doing a pretty good job of matching
[SPEAKER_03]: the observations really throughout this
whole 100 plus year period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, how do we get these big,
large scale grid boxes to come down to a
[SPEAKER_03]: local level?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we say, okay, this box here that's
the size of New York or almost the size of
[SPEAKER_03]: New York that has one temperature value,
one everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we start to make some inferences on
how climate change will impact the wine
[SPEAKER_03]: industry perhaps, water resources in the
New York City water?
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that happen on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't care about what's going on
globally or even New York size.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to bring these data down to a
different level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as an example of what I mean,
this is the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the elevation of the United
States as seen by climate model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do see the Rocky Mountains here in
kind of the white, but they're no more
[SPEAKER_03]: than a little hump, a little bump on the
map.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we go down to the scale we really
need, we want the mountains to look like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing that's driving the
snowpack in the West and water resources
[SPEAKER_03]: in the West, not this little hump in the
map.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these types of features start to become
very, very important when we want to look
[SPEAKER_03]: at local scale impacts or even regional
scale impacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we get from one to another is
through a process called downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really here it's an idea of resolving
the mismatch of the scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show some examples, it can be done
statistically or it can be done
[SPEAKER_03]: dynamically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically using a finer scale model to
do the downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of these have their origins in
weather prediction.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the current state of the art is one is
no better than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both have their pros and cons and in
the end either one of these is an
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptable method.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing a lot of work recently in
the climate project that Dave and Jonathan
[SPEAKER_03]: have been involved with and us over at
Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really looking at statistical downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've been doing some dynamical
downscaling too for things like lake
[SPEAKER_03]: effect snow that kind of lends itself to
that application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to give you an idea of how this works
in weather forecasting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the results from last week of the
EAS weather forecasting contest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of these are students.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically what I wanted to show is the
best forecast here is basically through a
[SPEAKER_03]: statistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statistical downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a totally statistical forecast.
[SPEAKER_03]: No person is involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes right off the computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beating me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a consensus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a number of these different
statistical approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a particular statistical approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again it's doing fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian is our computer guru and he runs the
dynamical model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically takes the forecast right from
the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again the model is doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this idea of downscaling from a model
to the Game Farm Road weather station.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see it in action in weather forecasts
and my argument here is either I'm doing
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty poorly or it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doing pretty well in this case
through the semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: Notice where Wysocki is if anybody knows
Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's your humanoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the undergrads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we look at statistical downscaling
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really the biggest pro is it's
computationally inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or relatively easy to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tailor it to specific variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look at some exotic things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that aren't even in the climate
models.
[SPEAKER_03]: Storm surges, air quality perhaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can be made site specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the downsides is the biggest downside
perhaps is it's not describing the
[SPEAKER_03]: physical process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making a big leap of faith that
whatever we're basing our statistics on
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't changing in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're saying okay whatever the
relationship we're looking at today or
[SPEAKER_03]: basing our model on today is going to hold
in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that may or may not be a good
assumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: The simplest way to do this is just to say
okay I use this providence basically if I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to look at providence annual precip
and I look at the GCM grid that
[SPEAKER_03]: encompasses providence and I strike a
regression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a one to one relationship if
it were perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's somewhere off of the one to one
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can use that as my downside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't want to say too much about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at some of the more common ways
that are doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the New York assessment again that Dave
and Jonathan and some others in the room
[SPEAKER_03]: have been involved with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use what's called a delta net.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically here we have an observed
distribution of temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this case our observed period is from
70 to 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have what the model says is the
observed distribution of temperature for
[SPEAKER_03]: that particular point in the same period
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't match up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have what the model is saying
the temperature is at some point in time
[SPEAKER_03]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the delta becomes the model present
minus the model future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this blue area there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that delta is applied back to the
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words here are my daily
observations from say of temperature from
[SPEAKER_03]: say Rochester from 1970.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to each day all I do is add this
delta.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this delta were five degrees each
observation here gets inflated by five
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again a fairly simple method of doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest drawback in my mind is the
variability of the climate never changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was cold on this day relatively cold
on this day in 1970 it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively cold on that day and in the
future model just five degrees warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same progression of temperature
changes and stays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just gets translated upward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more sophisticated methods actually
look at the whole distribution of
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows delta to change not defines
delta not just at the median or the
[SPEAKER_03]: average but across the whole distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be my example here of
perhaps in the green an observed here we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a cumulative distribution function on
percentage of observations here in green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does the delta change at each of
these nodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the model is cooler at the very
low end and maybe it's higher at the very
[SPEAKER_03]: high end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there's a large difference in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of these are taking into account.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore we can start to adjust days
differently depending on how hot or cold
[SPEAKER_03]: they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to skip to the next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another way to do this is to look at a
greater suite of predictors.
[SPEAKER_03]: To use all this information that the
climate models give us things like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what is the 500 millibar height.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of a weather map.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the winds doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So use all this whole if I asked you if I
told you from the model it was going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cloudy today and there was going to be a
trough over New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say even basic weather would you
say it's going to be a hot day or a warm
[SPEAKER_03]: day?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hot day or a cold day?
[SPEAKER_03]: A cool day right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A trough is generally cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clouds we don't have any sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that type of broad scale information
kind of gets some information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do I want to go with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example of downscaling using
this for snowpacking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is some work that we've done where
lots of lines here probably not the best
[SPEAKER_03]: graph to show on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black line is the historical snow
depth at Wanakena ranger station in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue line is basically a climate model
that we have downscaled to that particular
[SPEAKER_03]: location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would argue that in my blue line
we're doing pretty good in getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: maximum average snow depth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is over a period of time so in any
average year you would expect there to be
[SPEAKER_03]: at least 20 inches of snow on the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much getting the timing fairly good
in the beginning and the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're losing our snowpack at least at a
similar rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our timing is off by a few by about a week
or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we basically replicate this fairly
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purple, the mustard, and the red are
the model run on this station through into
[SPEAKER_03]: the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we downscale the data from the GCM for
the 20s, the 50s, and the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see in the 20s the purple line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We reduce our snowpack a little bit,
not much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kind of shorten our snow season
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really not until the 50s and the
80s that we really see dramatic increases.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the snow depth of this station based on
this downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically going from on average 20 inches
to on average about 4 inches of snow at
[SPEAKER_03]: this Adirondack location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also notice not too much change in what's
going on at the beginning of the season
[SPEAKER_03]: when we start to accumulate snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a dramatic change at the end of the
season for when we lose the snowpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically from mid May to actually early
April in when the snowpack comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, a technique that can be used for
downscaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: A dynamical downscaling, we're using
basically a model in a model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's keeping the physics, but it's very
computationally expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as an example, if I wanted to focus in
on the U.S., what I would do is have a
[SPEAKER_03]: small area just over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: of the globe and kind of cut it out like a
patchwork fill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, the world is going to end
at these boundaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at each of the boundaries,
what's going to be fed in are conditions
[SPEAKER_03]: from the global circulation model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those global grids basically are
feeding what's going on in this inner
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this inner model, we can start to
get the resolution down to the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: might resolve the Adirondacks and the
lakes and things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as an example, I'm kind of showing a
number of different approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is obviously the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are data out of the Northeast
Climate Impacts Assessment by Heho Edel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Edel is Dave Wolf, and I was
involved with that, and a number of other
[SPEAKER_03]: people like Cornell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a report that preceded the
climate report.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're looking at precipitation here,
I believe, in this graphic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in panel E, these are the stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, the blues are showing
different levels of precipitation,
[SPEAKER_03]: given by the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: H, on the other hand, is the precipitation
from a global circulation model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we have these big patches in
each of these boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the grids on the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: The F is if we downscale this with a
dynamical model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So feed this information into a finer
scale model.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get an idea of what the grid size
is from these boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see, we start to pick up more
of the detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see the Adirondacks and their
effect toward higher precipitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some of that down in the
Catskills as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see some of the mountains or
graphic precipitation coming out in New
[SPEAKER_03]: England.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, in this panel here,
this is a statistically downscaled
[SPEAKER_03]: simulation of the same data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of these are showing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stations, global model, dynamically
downscaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Statistically downscaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, this is downscaled to about an
eighth of a degree resolution better than
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, kind of picking up the
Adirondacks, Catskills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, our highest rainfall in New York
is right around here in the New York City
[SPEAKER_03]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That brings up very nicely up and down the
mountains of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I will open it up for some
questions here.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the last slide that you had,
so in G, it looks like Connecticut gets a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot more rain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't, you know, the large model
in H and then in the other one in F.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why, you know, it seems like it's
fairly consistent with New York,
[SPEAKER_06]: but all of a sudden Connecticut,
but not in New Jersey, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's just an aspect of the model,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, aspect of the model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, probably some coastal
influences there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually look, if we actually
looked at the observations as sparse as
[SPEAKER_03]: they are, you know, basically you have
this large area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecticut and the observations look a
lot like most of New York except the high
[SPEAKER_03]: peaks of the Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this case, this statistical method
does make a little bit more sense that way
[SPEAKER_03]: rather than this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping in mind, I'm cheating a little bit
there because these observations are
[SPEAKER_03]: driving the statistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not driving the dynamical model
here in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, an example of this being used
in real time, if you watch, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: going from climate to weather,
if you watch any of the local weather,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, weathercasts on TV where they
kind of have their own, they basically are
[SPEAKER_03]: running their own mini model, especially
now that it's getting to the lake effect
[SPEAKER_03]: season.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a big national forecast model
that's not going to get the lake effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these smaller models that can resolve
the lake, can resolve the temperatures of
the lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's being used on this small
scale by the TV meteorologists and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the weather service offices
around New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that type of information is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In none of the global circulation models
are the Great Lakes included.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take that back, one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're looking at something like
Great Lakes, that is just something that
[SPEAKER_03]: is falling through the cracks in these
models.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then even as we get down to the
smaller scale, if we're looking at things
[SPEAKER_03]: like what might be going on in the finger
lakes, it's in most of the finest scale
[SPEAKER_03]: models, they're, you know, the finger
lakes themselves are one grid box.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really tough even there to look at
that type of effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really have a scale effect in going
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if we wanted to look at what's going
to be going on right in the lakes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we have to basically take the
models that are out there and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: increase their resolution to get the lakes
because the lakes are just too small to be
[SPEAKER_03]: resolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were a little bit bigger,
they would be nicely in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but their current size doesn't match up
with the grid reading in these models.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not sure how to ask this
actually, but if you go backwards in this
[SPEAKER_02]: process, you're talking about this amazing
increase in computing power needs to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the global climate model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet most people, yeah, okay, that's
interesting, but I want to know with 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: certainty what the weather is going to be
a week from today because I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: wedding to go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the computing power that we're
getting for the global climate model
[SPEAKER_02]: filtering down to these more local and
shorter term situations?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to a certain degree, but I mean the
bad news is you're never going to get 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: accuracy because it's just the chaos in
the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have as much computing power as
you want, but the solutions to the
[SPEAKER_03]: equations that you need to solve in the
real world are in some cases, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have multiple solutions or,
you know, you have the idea of a butterfly
[SPEAKER_03]: flapping its wings and you go off in
another direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're never going to have the
observations at a fine enough density to
[SPEAKER_03]: resolve all of that to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get down to a level, it's not so
much the computing power, but you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the observations to, you know,
garbage in, garbage out if you don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: the observations at the scale that things
are happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to initialize
the model at those scales, and even there
[SPEAKER_03]: the equations can go awry with a small
tweak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where what is done both in the weather
scale and also the climate scale is using
[SPEAKER_03]: what are called ensembles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words I can, and that's where
the computing power comes in, I can take
[SPEAKER_03]: my initialization of the model and tweak
it a little bit to say I'm not exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: sure what the state of the atmosphere
looks like right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to say it could look like
this, it could look like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could look like something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in each of those cases I'm going to
use that as an initial condition to my
[SPEAKER_03]: model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as I model it into the future,
the idea is if, you know, the initial
[SPEAKER_03]: state makes a big difference, the models
are going to diverge and then I can say
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris flip a coin for your wedding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the, if the, if the divergence,
you know, if the models are close
[SPEAKER_03]: together, that gives you some increase in
certainty in your forecast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean a lot, I know, I see Marty in
the back a lot of times when, when,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we do the turf call, you know,
I'll say I don't have any confidence in
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going to happen a week from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some weeks I say, yeah,
it looks pretty good, it's going to be
hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and kind of what we're looking at
there is, you know, are, are these
[SPEAKER_03]: ensembles going off in different
directions or are they all converging on
[SPEAKER_03]: the same solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do the same thing with a climate
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you can not so much tweak the
initial conditions, but one, what's done
[SPEAKER_03]: there is really the thing that's driving
the differences there are how the models
[SPEAKER_03]: are parameterized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are clouds going to make a big
difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is this guy doing the clouds better
than somebody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: So an ensemble of climate models tends to
be basically just different models or
[SPEAKER_03]: slightly different models to see how that
progresses out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you never see, you're never
going to see in 2100 that this is what the
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature is going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a range of temperatures
to give you an idea of the uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken, you had a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with respect to the duration of
snowpack, particularly at higher
[SPEAKER_01]: latitudes, do the models take into
consideration albedo changes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'll ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which models are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the global scale, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these dynamical models, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, you know, in a dynamical model,
it's, you know, even if we're at a small
[SPEAKER_03]: one kilometer, two kilometer grid,
if it's snowing more, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is clearly one of the main
things that will be driving those models
[SPEAKER_03]: is what is the albedo and that will be
related to the snowpack.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we get into a statistical model,
you know, there is no, there isn't that
[SPEAKER_03]: give and take there in that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically at the large scale,
this is what it's predicting and albedo
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to, you know, discussions
about afforestation on a large global
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, apparently, to counteract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I mean, yes, that's clearly
something that's used in the models.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, actually we do, in my climate
change class, I read a paper where they
[SPEAKER_03]: afforestate a large part of Canada and the
idea is that, well, that should draw down
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a good thing for climate
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, what it does is you're
taking, you know, they're doing this on
[SPEAKER_03]: the prairies that are normally snow
covered in the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you're doing is taking away the
snow cover and putting coniferous forest,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has, is absorbing a lot of
radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically the radiation effect,
absorbing that radiation equals the same
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of warming that you'd get by
removing the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a balance in the end due to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that is one of the neat
things about the models that you can do
[SPEAKER_03]: those exercises and do those thought
experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, clearly when the models are run
for these big IPCC reports, the runs take
[SPEAKER_03]: years to run.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the runs for the current, the next IPCC
report are actually being ginned up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the runs for these, the next
round of IPCC reports will be done at,
[SPEAKER_03]: in not the entire globe, but in a large
part of the globe, at a very fine
[SPEAKER_03]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will almost be like not dynamically
downscaling, but actually running the
[SPEAKER_03]: global models at select locations at a
very, very fine scale, the US being one of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be a very different,
you know, as the models increase,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll see a very different flavor to the
kind of IPCC reports that will come out in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be much more downloadable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim?
[SPEAKER_05]: You showed us why you can make much better
predictions on the climate than on the
[SPEAKER_05]: weather forecast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you start downscaling,
as you described, do you introduce a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of noise in that manner so that the
predictions you're making for,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say, Ithaca versus Syracuse become
almost the same kind of noise as your
[SPEAKER_05]: weather forecasting does?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what I want to say is where it
doesn't become the noise is if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: representing a key process, if you're
dynamically downscaling, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's use the lakes as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say I care about how lake effect
snow is going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even in a forecast, I care about
whether there's going to be lake effect
[SPEAKER_03]: snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that I'm putting those lakes in
there and allowing, you know, physically
[SPEAKER_03]: modeling that process, I'm getting a lot
of signal there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going, if we're taking the lakes
out and just saying, okay, how is the
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature going to vary between maybe
not, I'll not pick on Syracuse,
[SPEAKER_03]: Ithaca and Binghamton, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are really, it's just noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a big driving physical
mechanism that would make that change like
[SPEAKER_03]: would be in lake effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer is going to be yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a real local application question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where does the Ithaca Journal get its
information on weather?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe their forecasts come from a
private forecasting company in State
[SPEAKER_03]: College, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get it from you?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get it from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, a long time ago we used to,
I mean, same type of thing when I was at
[SPEAKER_03]: Rutgers many moons ago, the meteorology
department there used to ask for local
[SPEAKER_03]: paper, but it's, the media markets have
gotten more global and national and big
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all going to these companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no, the only thing that might
come, that does to a native journalist,
[SPEAKER_03]: the observations came from a newspaper and
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want a good, call the Cornell
weather phone and get the, get the.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the number?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm embarrassed to say I don't know off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's on the U portal too,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the U portal too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what?
[SPEAKER_03]: On the Cornell site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question from Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard cases where there's suggestions
that the night temperatures will warm more
[SPEAKER_00]: than day temperatures in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about, about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that always going to be the
case or what's the basis?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is definitely true in the
observations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the models do show a warming of,
of nighttime temperatures relative to
[SPEAKER_03]: daytime temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not, what it is not is the
fact, you know, we're always radiating
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not the fact that, you know,
at nighttime, we're not getting any
[SPEAKER_03]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just radiating energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the, the change in nighttime
temperature, I believe has to do actually
[SPEAKER_03]: with more land use change and things like
that where, you know, urbanization and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and things along those lines,
even just buildings and things like that
[SPEAKER_03]: have a higher heat capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the heat is being stored more at the
day and then being given off at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That answer your question, Alan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tomorrow's the election.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard quite a few Republican
politicians the last couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: saying that this whole thing is just a
liberal hoax to, you know, get more votes
[SPEAKER_04]: or do you, do you think the modeling will
ever reach a level or there, there is some
[SPEAKER_04]: number of data points or some margin of
error that we will get to that will
[SPEAKER_04]: convince skeptics that, that this is
really happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I'm not saying that the reason
that I'm saying that is there'll always be
[SPEAKER_03]: uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there always is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's not an issue of whether
the science is correct or accurate or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my, in my opinion, it's, it's an issue
of what do we have to do to correct the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the solution to the problem is not
appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will require drastic changes in the way
we do business and operate society and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's the thing that in my mind
drives the politics and the sides of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, where it becomes tough is,
you know, it is hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you, you know, if I'm along the
coast and I'm New York City and I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: darn, you know, there, you know,
sea level rise, you got the, the error
[SPEAKER_03]: bars there are getting smaller and smaller
and smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a big problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm here in upstate New York talking to
Neil in Minnesota, you know, maybe a few
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees of warming, you know, there's
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be winners and losers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have that, that part of thing too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're looking collectively as a
globe, clearly the problem is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The solution to the problem of global
warming is, in my mind, also the solution
[SPEAKER_03]: to a lot of the other world's problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that whole thing should be
packaged together and coming up with a
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we should end it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's thank Art again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
