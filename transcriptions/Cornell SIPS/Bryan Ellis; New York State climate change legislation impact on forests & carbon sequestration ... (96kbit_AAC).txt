[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Brian Ellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the section leader for the climate
forestry and carbon section in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Division of Lamps and Forests,
the New York State DEC, so that's quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: mouthful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today what I'm going to try to talk to
everyone about is the New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: status and trends of our forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we learned a lot about carbon stock
versus carbon sequestration today,
[SPEAKER_01]: some things that affect it, and I'm going
to talk about the challenge that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead in terms of where New York forests
are, so the status of those forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to talk about some
policy issues, talk about the Climate
[SPEAKER_01]: Leadership and Community Protection Act,
the CLCPA, and the forestry
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations that we've made there to
help us meet our climate goals by 2050.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a brief overview of those main
strategies we've identified for combating
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change through forests is keeping
forests as forests, and that's avoiding
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion of our forests to non-forested
use, improved forest management within our
[SPEAKER_01]: current forested areas, afforestation and
reforestation, urban forestry,
[SPEAKER_01]: so trees in our urban areas, which you
have multiple benefits in terms of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration but also cooling effects in
those urban heat islands, reducing energy
[SPEAKER_01]: costs in those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to touch briefly on
bioeconomy, but Tim went over that really
[SPEAKER_01]: well and the benefits of it, and that's
something that the recommendations in the
[SPEAKER_01]: forestry panel outlay that need to be
pushed further, and we need to really
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivize getting more of that on the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to talk about some
current DEC programs, opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: landowners, if we have landowners out on
the call here, that DEC has, what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do on your properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, this is work that DEC has
been doing for a while, but hasn't had as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a climate lens on it, and it also
is something that's going to need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: ramped up if we're really going to make an
impact moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a brief overview of the CLCPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was passed a few years ago and
established Climate Action Council,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was made to develop a scoping plan,
which is basically a plan of action for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to meet our climate goals in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those goals are 70% renewable energy
by 2030, 100% zero emissions from
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical generation by 2040,
and 85% reduction in greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_01]: emissions by 2050, with the goal of net
zero emissions in New York by 2050.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at that 85% reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions, getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: that 100%, the last 15% of that would be
from carbon sequestration within our
[SPEAKER_01]: forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we're going,
is looking at the carbon sequestration
[SPEAKER_01]: rates of New York's forests, working on
increasing that and offsetting about 15%
[SPEAKER_01]: of our emissions in New York with
sequestration from our forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a brief overview of our forests in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim talked about the trends of forests
in New York a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was really important for us
to think about the loss of forests in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York from the 18th century into the 19th
century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the steady incline in forests that
we've had as forests have regrown on
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really important context to
think about when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: forests in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have about 18.6 million acres of
forest in New York currently, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: about 62% of New York forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm talking about these forest
stats, which I'm going to talk about for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next couple of minutes, a couple of
slides here, most of the information that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about comes from the Forest
Inventory Analysis Program, or FIA
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's run by the Forest Service.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's permanent plots across New York's
landscapes that monitors New York forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get annual reports from those as
well as five-year reports, which are much
[SPEAKER_01]: more in-depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most recent one was published in
2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where most of the data that
I'll be talking about in that comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most concerning part of this trend,
and it's really great to think of New York
[SPEAKER_01]: forests regrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had increase in forest area for over
50 years in New York state, close to 100
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the last 10 years, we've been
losing forests in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since about 2012, we've had a decrease
of about 1% of forest area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing, when you look at,
you break down that forest loss,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing that about 49% of it is from
agriculture, and about 33% of it is from
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this kind of tells us that we've kind
of gained a lot of that forest that we
[SPEAKER_01]: would gain naturally from people advancing
agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see some farmers take
back those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also seeing lots of
developments sprawl into our forested
[SPEAKER_01]: areas and affect those forested areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as we look at the status of
New York forests and the gains and losses
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years, we'll typically see a flux
between agriculture and forests every year
[SPEAKER_01]: or every five-year cycle that we get these
more in-depth reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's less concerning because
those areas are natural areas that we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to regrow over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The loss to development is definitely a
more concerning loss in that those areas
[SPEAKER_01]: are definitely harder for forests to
reclaim or a more permanent loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Tim laid out, those are definitely
a big carbon release when we talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: loss to development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next thing that I think is
important to discuss when talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: these goals and the forests of New York is
to understand where our forests are in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York, who owns our forests, so we can
think about how to affect management
[SPEAKER_01]: across the forests in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as many people here know, about 3.1
million acres of forest area in New York
[SPEAKER_01]: is in the Adirondack and Capskill Park,
as well as state parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are areas that are not
managed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaining carbon stocks over time,
but as they regrow, the sequestration rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of those forests is going to continue to
slow until we reach kind of an equilibrium
[SPEAKER_01]: in those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not a lot of management that
can happen in those areas, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: important carbon stores on our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, the state owns about
800,000 acres of state forest land across
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are actively managed forests
that are green certified and their timber
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting occurs on those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you break that down, that's not a
lot of the 18.6 million acres of forest in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of that is privately owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 74% of New York forests are
privately owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's 69% of the carbon stocks on
New York forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those forests are owned by private
landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to make an impact in
terms of in the carbon stores and forest
[SPEAKER_01]: space in New York, you're going to have to
work with private landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a real challenge
because there's over 700,000 landowners
[SPEAKER_01]: who own forests across New York,
about 13.6 million acres of forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we get this information from
the Forest Service.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a national woodland owner
survey, which they send out every few
[SPEAKER_01]: years to talk to woodland owners about
things that they care about to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how many woodland owners there are out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use those statistics when trying to
make these kind of decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so about close to 200,000 of those
owners own 10 acres or more, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: about 68% of the private land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I break that statistic out just
because 10 acres is an important
[SPEAKER_01]: inflection point for where you can do some
active management on those properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: where below 10 acres, there are some
management actions that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, to have a timber harvest and
to really actively manage your properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to focus on those forests that
would landowners who have a larger impact
[SPEAKER_01]: and would be able to do more sustainable
management on that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concerning thing when thinking about
these landowners is that only 25% of
[SPEAKER_01]: landowners surveyed in New York use the
professional forester during their last
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of landowners are out there
managing their forests but aren't getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the professional advice that they should
be when managing their properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So private forests are really where the
take-home message here is where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to be able to make an impact
when thinking about increasing carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: stores across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next thing thinking about our
forests is what's the structure of New
[SPEAKER_01]: York's forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about the area of forests
increasing in New York over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a general aging of our forests
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Tim talked a lot about the
trajectory of carbon sequestration in the
[SPEAKER_01]: forest and carbon stores in the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you remember some of the things
that he talked about as the forest ages,
[SPEAKER_01]: it slows down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that our forests have regrown
in New York and the data shows us that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have an aging forest in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the last number of years,
we've seen decreases in the seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: sapling age class on our forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that is these forests
regrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a big regeneration issue in
New York as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that leads to a lot of concern over
regrowth of forests, mostly due to
[SPEAKER_01]: increased deer populations and invasive
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as those forests age, they're going
to slow down in terms of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to note when looking at
the data is that 43% of our forests are
[SPEAKER_01]: moderately or poorly stocked in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something to take into
account that a lot of those areas could
[SPEAKER_01]: have higher stocking in those forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're degraded forests either through
invasive species or past management
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's going to be a lot of work
to be done within our current forests to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve that stocking, have them fully
occupy those sites, and maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration and carbon storage within
the forest areas of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a pretty large area to be
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also seen that kind of leads into
the same topic and increase in what we in
[SPEAKER_01]: the forestry world call cull or
unacceptable growing stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trees that would not grow into a forest
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen an increase in that in our
forests over the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's a trend that we've been seeing
for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that leads us to believe that there's
invasive species affecting our forests out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, that there's past management
practices that have taken the best and
[SPEAKER_01]: left the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as those trees age, they're not going
to have the economic value that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to affect the type of
management that's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen on those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if those kind of harvests are going to
be economically viable, or if incentives
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be necessary to encourage and
promote sustainable forestry on those
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing I want to talk about in
terms of our forests to kind of put our
[SPEAKER_01]: policies into context here are the tree
species in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim talked a little bit about assisted
migration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look, and I think that's really
an important point to hit on, is what tree
[SPEAKER_01]: species we have in our forests in New
York, where those are trending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so red maple is the most common tree
in New York by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less commercially valuable than a lot
of other trees in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen an increase in this tree
species in New York, and a decrease in
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar maple, which is a much more valuable
species, and longer lived species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of important to note as I move
through this, is that eastern hemlock and
[SPEAKER_01]: white ash are number four and five as the
most common trees in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two really big invasive species
that are affecting both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a really big
concern moving forward in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: loss of those species from our landscapes
and the impact that that's going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: on our forests as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, we've seen relatively stable
species composition in our forests over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 years with some gains and
losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One resource I just wanted to point people
out to is the USDA Tree Atlas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can send a link around to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an interesting resource for folks
to look at projections on where tree
[SPEAKER_01]: species will do well in terms of future
climate predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got some tree species that
you're looking at in your area,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an interesting resource to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of the elephant in the room
here is invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are affected by them in New York,
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are affected by them more than any
other state in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see by this map here,
we have more invasive species per county
[SPEAKER_01]: than any other state in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really due to the commercial
commercial commerce that is happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ports that we have in New York City,
as well as the seaway as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really big entry points for
invasive species coming in on wood
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging material like pallets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the major invasive species
that we're seeing affecting New York right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, Asian longhorn beetles, a really big
threat, but seems to be something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had more effect in controlling and
recently have eradicated it from some
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of Long Island that we had it in the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's emerald ash borer, which is widely
affecting ash trees across New York and is
[SPEAKER_01]: having a really big impact on our forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemlock woolly adelgid, which was talked
about earlier, has been in New York since
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1980s and has been moving northward
and has had a really dramatic effect on
[SPEAKER_01]: the hemlocks in New York, especially in
the lower Hudson Valley in the Finger
[SPEAKER_01]: Lakes region, where she's really starting
to see mortality in recent years due to
[SPEAKER_01]: hemlock woolly adelgid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last few years, we also have
seen this pest move up into the
[SPEAKER_01]: Adirondacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which at one point, folks thought might be
able to resist hemlock woolly adelgid due
[SPEAKER_01]: to the cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, as HWA has moved northward,
it seems to have become very weather and
[SPEAKER_01]: cold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have our largest
stocks of hemlocks in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: the densest populations of hemlocks in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that could be a real concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the next 20 or 30 years, as hemlock
woolly adelgid moves up in that area,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets a foothold and then really affects
those forests and those areas that some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, hemlock is the most common species
in those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other species that we see affecting
forests in New York, southern pine beetle,
[SPEAKER_01]: has been found in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has killed thousands of acres of pitch
pine in Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a species that had never been found
this far north before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's common in the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: But due to climate change and warming
temperatures, we're seeing it expand its
[SPEAKER_01]: range into New York area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to be a really big
concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that even in the last few years,
we've trapped individuals much farther
[SPEAKER_01]: north than Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so DEC is continually monitoring the
pest to see if we can find it or
[SPEAKER_01]: infestations north of Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Schwangong, the Albany pine bush,
areas like that, which we are really
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about the impact they can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that pest takes a hold, it can wipe out
in the south hundreds of acres in a really
[SPEAKER_01]: short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotted lanternflies and other ones that
might not be causing extreme mortality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but could reduce productivity and impact
regeneration for forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's another pest that we're keeping an
eye on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsy moss, which was very prevalent on
our landscape last year, is also affecting
[SPEAKER_01]: our forests, reducing productivity and can
cause widespread mortality at high
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, tough shell disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a variety of other species that
have a large impact on our forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all compounds a problem and
speaks to kind of the issue that Tim was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about in terms of permanence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the carbon stores on those forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important for us to combat those
in order to protect our forests and
[SPEAKER_01]: improve sequestration across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't spend too much time on this,
but this is kind of an overview slide and
[SPEAKER_01]: a good graphic in my mind on the carbon
cycle between forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing is here is that
young forests sequester carbon faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mature forests store carbon longer and
carbon is released from forests through
[SPEAKER_01]: things like land use change, insects and
disease, wildfire and decomposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And harvests do have a, you know,
I would say the harvests do have an impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on carbon stores, but especially if those
products go to durable goods, like we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about in the previous presentation,
you know, that carbon for long-term and
[SPEAKER_01]: can have a huge benefit in terms of
continued sequestration, forest management
[SPEAKER_01]: and climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of bring this back to a
policy lens, now that we've put it into
[SPEAKER_01]: context and where our New York forests are
currently, we're looking at the graph on
[SPEAKER_01]: the left here talks about our
sequestration goals and the current
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestration rate in New York forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many million metric tons per year
are forested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forests are sequestering and in about
1990, so 30 years ago or so, we were
[SPEAKER_01]: storing about 30 million metric tons of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that rate decrease as our
forest has aged and affected by invasive
[SPEAKER_01]: species to, you know, about 25 million
metric tons today, 26, somewhere around
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, again, we get this data from the
Forest Service Inventory Analysis Project,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as I'm using some land cover data
as well to look at using satellite imagery
[SPEAKER_01]: to see where forests are and make some
calculations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking forward, we're hoping to
try to reverse that trend by 2030 through
[SPEAKER_01]: our strategy in terms of keeping forests
as forests and improving forest
[SPEAKER_01]: management, afforestation, reforestation,
adding trees for urban landscapes and then
[SPEAKER_01]: using good forest management and
bioeconomy to sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to need to, if we were to
offset 15% of emissions by 2050,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to need to sequester about,
or have our forests sequester about 60
[SPEAKER_01]: million metric tons, so over double what
they're sequestering today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a tall order for our forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think we have some really
aggressive tactics that we're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're going to see how far
we can get to reaching that goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first strategy that I want to talk a
little bit about is keeping forests as
[SPEAKER_01]: forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right here, we see the current
carbon stores in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the information put out by
FIA, but we are also working with ESF,
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing some satellite imagery to light
our data to try to refine this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we will hopefully, in the coming
years, have some more precise tools coming
[SPEAKER_01]: on to tell us where we're gaining carbon,
where we're losing carbon to target some
[SPEAKER_01]: of our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really important work that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at this area, you see that
our highest carbon stores, unsurprisingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the Adirondacks and the Catskill
Park areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Tug Hill also has quite a bit of
carbon stored.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see a lot of opportunity in the
Finger Lakes region, the North Country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and areas in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hudson Valley also seems to have a lot
less carbon stores, definitely probably
[SPEAKER_01]: related to things like development and
things like that in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: For keeping forests as forests,
obviously one of the main things here
[SPEAKER_01]: would be land acquisition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fee and conservation easements are a
really important part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fee ownership would be purchasing the
property outright in conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: easements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the land owned in private hands,
but usually it's the purchasing of
[SPEAKER_01]: development rights of that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it keeps those forests as forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: While allowing for them to be working
land, especially when talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Adirondack Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: This strategy would relate to state
acquisitions, municipal acquisitions,
[SPEAKER_01]: land trust acquisitions, but taking that
development pressure away from those
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that local governments are going
to be a key part of this, including
[SPEAKER_01]: acquisition of really important properties
to them and their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their comprehensive plans and two new
programs that we've been rolling out at
[SPEAKER_01]: DEC this year are a community forest grant
program, which funds municipalities to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase community forest land that might
not fit a state profile for what a state
[SPEAKER_01]: would purchase, and keeps the hands of
forests and local control.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as a conservation easement for
land trust program, which is going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: fund some land trusts purchasing more
properties across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next strategy here is real property
tax incentives for forest landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this strategy really fits into both
improved forest management as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping forests as forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to kind of talk about it
here, but I think it's important to note
[SPEAKER_01]: that properties that are managed under the
current 4ADA forest tax law program are
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested more sustainably than properties
that are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some studies have shown that in New
York, especially in the New York City
[SPEAKER_01]: watershed region, as well as better BMPs
occur on those properties as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are definitely incentives tied
to a lot of those practices, which
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage good management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a 4ADA forest tax law program is a
program that's been around since the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1970s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came together after an older program,
480, and it's a timber focused program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's managing properties for
sustainable timber products coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Parcels have to be at least 50 acres of
forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's penalties in terms of taking
your property out of 4ADA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since this program is older,
it's not carbon focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really timber production focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that it needs some updates
legislatively to be amended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that is a
recommendation that came from the forestry
[SPEAKER_01]: panel with the CLCPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to modernize the program, reduce that
acre threshold possibly to allow more
[SPEAKER_01]: landowners to be able to take benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, take advantage of the program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently only 9% of eligible landowners
in New York are part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you try to get out of 4ADA,
there are also very strict penalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it really helps people keep
their properties by reducing the burden of
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an 80% reduction in the assessed
value of those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also because those properties will be
benefiting the public and creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: system that will be able to maintain
forest product off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're required to have management plans,
be managed by a professional forester,
[SPEAKER_01]: and those plans are reviewed by DEC staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that program, I think the
state has recognized the importance that
[SPEAKER_01]: not everyone wants to manage their
properties for timber.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also, that has a real benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so 480B and 480C are two newer
programs that were recommended out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: forestry panel that have smaller acreage
requirements for landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And timber harvesting is not a requirement
with that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if done, would have to be done by a
professional forester and go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEC approval process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that ensures that sustainable
practices are happening on the property,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also gives people a tax benefit for
holding forest land in New York while
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing the tax burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on those properties to help people
keep those properties in forests and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: them from getting parcelized and
fragmented.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen over the last number of years a
reduction in the average size of forest
[SPEAKER_01]: land holdings in New York as properties
get continually split up, which limits the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for those properties to be
managed sustainably and increases
[SPEAKER_01]: development on those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's some specifics here in
terms of how those programs would work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd be glad to talk about it more with
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are relatively general
recommendations, but we see a need to give
[SPEAKER_01]: the landowners more options to get more
landowners enrolled in these type of
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these programs have a broader impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the states around New York currently
have tax law programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all are similar, but also very
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And programs like Vermont's Use Value
Appraisal Program have much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: enrollment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see 60%, 70% of the eligible
forests in those areas enrolled in those
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those programs tend to have a broader
scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: They affect more landowners and can really
push the good management out onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last strategy here is regulating
forest land conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we talk about the importance of
carbon stores and combating climate change
[SPEAKER_01]: and carbon sequestration, we recognize the
importance of forests for all New Yorkers
[SPEAKER_01]: for the value that those forests provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similar to wetland protection laws,
which saw the importance of wetlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: this regulation or keeping forests as
forest law would try to prevent land
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the law would be set up similar to
what our wetland law would be,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would look to avoid impacts to
forests, to minimize where possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then to mitigate those carbon losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the recommendations the forestry
panel talked about was exempting
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture from this as land kind of
fluxes between those two areas regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And agricultural lands would be still
working land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil would still be intact in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was an important distinction that
the panel recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Participating in carbon markets is a
pretty complicated thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can talk about it more as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are ways carbon markets are
growing in popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a number of folks starting to get
involved in that, especially if they have
[SPEAKER_01]: larger land holdings of 2,000 or more
acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do promote good forest management
on those properties through long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts that are typically signed by
most of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that the
recommendations have been needed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: explored more to see how we can
incentivize good management on the
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of, we do not have a mandatory
market in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that hasn't been set
up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the CLCPA puts quite a bit of strict
regulations on how that would be set up in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of offsets needing to be within 25
miles, I think it is, of an emission
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would make it quite challenging to
put something like that together,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of emission sources don't
have available mitigation areas close to
[SPEAKER_01]: those source areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next strategy that I want to talk
about here is improved forest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the importance of increasing the carbon
stocks in our current forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked about it a little bit
earlier, but forest pests play a huge role
[SPEAKER_01]: in New York forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the carbon stocks there, we've seen
emerald ash borer, especially,
[SPEAKER_01]: and hemlock woolly dildard having impact
on our forest across New York as we lose
[SPEAKER_01]: those species from the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these forest pests can reduce
productivity, increase mortality,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an increased need for
prevention, rapid response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk a little bit later about
some resources that folks can get to with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DEC has a Bureau of Invasive Species
Management that can help folks with
[SPEAKER_01]: management of their forests and combating
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next is improved silviculture and
restoration of degraded stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important that we
facilitate good management on our
[SPEAKER_01]: properties and reduce and eliminate high
grading in those forests so we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: those degraded stands and understocked
stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking the best and leaving the rest to
the practice that has been documented in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces genetic quality of trees in the
area and the capacity of those forests to
[SPEAKER_01]: recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim talked a little bit about how to
deal with those stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we don't have very good low
grade markets to deal with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: degraded stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to need real incentives to
help landowners have the tools they need
[SPEAKER_01]: to restore these stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, outreach to landowners,
specific carbon training for foresters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and incentives to help landowners restore
impacted stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big issues in New York and the
map here on the right talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: regeneration issues in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over browsing by deer is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York in terms of forestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing to look at with this
map is anything that's red, orange,
[SPEAKER_01]: or yellow is considered insecure areas in
terms of regeneration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you lose a forest in that area due
to invasive species, a wind disturbance,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a harvest, those are areas that you
cannot guarantee that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that forest coming back naturally or very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could have continuation of some
shrub lands, which have a limited
[SPEAKER_01]: potential for sequestration and
regeneration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few areas in New York that
have secure regeneration, but those areas
[SPEAKER_01]: are few and far between.
[SPEAKER_01]: This work was done by TNC and I can
provide some of those links for folks if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really big strategy here is in terms of
afforestation and reforestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So combating the loss of forest,
we're really going to need to plant new
[SPEAKER_01]: trees in areas, identify and prioritize
areas that need new trees and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: reforest our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the map here on the right is work done
by TNC again on the reforestation hub.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really interesting work here
on availability of land for reforestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of important to,
if you think back to our carbon stock map
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were putting up, is that the areas
that have the lowest carbon stock seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the most area available for
reforestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Adirondacks and McCapskills don't
have a lot of area that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to reforest, but your Finger Lakes
region, your North Country are areas where
[SPEAKER_01]: we can really make an impact with this
strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: TNC estimated close to 4 million acres
might be available for reforestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think actual acreage is going to be a
bit lower than that and maybe in the 1
[SPEAKER_01]: million to 2 million range in terms of
what people are willing and want forests
[SPEAKER_01]: on their property, what areas are being
used for pasture and for agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, so where we're going to be able
to put those trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's also an important
crossroads here in terms of the conflict
[SPEAKER_01]: with renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the areas that are good
locations for solar and siding are also
[SPEAKER_01]: good locations for planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a need to
prioritize both of those actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to have to put solar
out in the landscape, we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to put forests on the landscape,
and we're going to need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: those two are not in conflict with each
other and we're doing both of them
[SPEAKER_01]: simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we're going to need
to work on is reforesting our understock
[SPEAKER_01]: stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's going to be a really
important part of this process as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to talk really briefly
about urban forestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urban forestry is a really important part
of our carbon stocks in that those trees
[SPEAKER_01]: in urban settings sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also reduce energy costs for our
homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have that multiple effect in
terms of climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so increasing tree canopies in our
urban areas is going to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEC currently has grant programs for
communities that we put out regularly in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to need to really ramp
those programs up if we're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: an impact in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have generally seen a decrease in our
urban forest over the last number of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can just tell you from my community
as we have increased windstorm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I see trees come down, then I hear
chainsaws going as everyone starts taking
[SPEAKER_01]: some more trees down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very rarely do I see folks replant big
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll see small trees,
but I see very few big trees being
[SPEAKER_01]: replanted in our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we're going to
need to work on reversing that trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bioeconomy is also really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the use of durable wood products
supporting our forest industry and the
[SPEAKER_01]: creation of those is going to be essential
if we're going to continue having good
[SPEAKER_01]: management on our landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, these lumber products have
sequestered carbon, while the substitute
[SPEAKER_01]: products they have like concrete or steel
take quite a bit of carbon to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a real a lot to be gained
by using these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are definitely a lot of hurdles
in terms of the construction industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they are used to using standard
practices, and getting these practices out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mass timber has a real potential
to make a big impact if we can get more
[SPEAKER_01]: adoption from developers when making
buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last section of my talk today,
I just want to talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities that landowners have.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these programs have been running
long standing programs, but we have some
[SPEAKER_01]: new programs at DEC that can help
landowners manage their properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that we've
recommended in the CLCPA to help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: forest management on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those haven't been
implemented yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot to be gained,
a lot of things that hopefully will be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is kind of what's available right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to run through a couple
DEC programs and touch briefly on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Resource Conservation Service
program, which is the Environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality Incentives Program, EQUIP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite a long name, but that is a long
standing program that helps people do
[SPEAKER_01]: improve forest management on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So EQUIP has a forest stand improvement
practice, which helps people improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: sustained forest health and productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the newer practices that
they're allowing here is increase or
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain carbon storage in their forests
is another practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need to talk with a
professional forester if you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in these programs or your local
NRCS office.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a grant program, and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure when they open up their
program, but it's also cost share.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think landowners do have to do some
contributing to this kind of a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our DEC's forest stewardship program is
long standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It connects landowners across the
landscape with professional forestry
[SPEAKER_01]: advice and management advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: DEC forest staff will go out and walk the
land with the landowner and work on either
[SPEAKER_01]: putting together a paper management plan
for them or giving them some technical
[SPEAKER_01]: assistance and basic guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on availability of our staff,
unfortunately, and reduction in the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of staff that we have to do this we don't
do a full inventory and stuff that a
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting forester would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after connecting with the landowner
and finding out what their goals for
[SPEAKER_01]: management are and what they're looking to
do, we often refer them to a cooperating
[SPEAKER_01]: forester, private consultant who works on
a fee basis with them for a lot of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking to do a timber harvest,
we always recommend working with a
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting forester to get the best
outcome that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: on that harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our 480A program, as I talked about a
little bit earlier, needs to be updated,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is still a really beneficial
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides an 80% reduction in the
assessed value of forest land that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: owns that's committed to this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rolling 10-year commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every year that you get the
benefit, you are enrolled for another 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years out from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it puts a lien on the DEC and so it
really is sort of like a temporary
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation easement on those properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also connects those landowners with
the tools that they need to properly
[SPEAKER_01]: manage their properties through
professional forest and DEC oversight in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of reviewing those management plans
and prescriptions for those harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the big crux here is that landlords
have to have at least 50 acres to commit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of requirements to the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important that landowners
know what they're getting into when they
[SPEAKER_01]: sign up for this kind of a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only 9% of New York forests are
enrolled in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a small percentage of New
York forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to really expand this in
order to make a big impact out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few other programs we run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Trees for Trips program, Buffer in a
Bag through the Saratoga Tree Nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: provides trees for landowners who are
looking to reforest riparian areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Saratoga Tree Nursery does seedlings
sales each year and sells pretty cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings to folks across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our Urban Forestry Grant program is
available to municipalities and nonprofits
[SPEAKER_01]: to either get urban management plans,
do tree planting work and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is working in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the newest round of that
grant is going to be released sometime in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just want to talk briefly about
our newest program that we started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just finished our first round in New
York, which is Regenerate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really targeting some of this
climate work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had four eligible practices here,
afforestation, reforestation, stand
[SPEAKER_01]: restoration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlling competing vegetation and
gearing closures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The round one had about $450,000 that we
allocated to landowners between that at
[SPEAKER_01]: least $3,000 to $50,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And money for that, there was a 25% match
for landowners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to match some of the work that
was happening out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it helps get some of this work out in
the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get it started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, when thinking about the
impact of this program, that $450,000 got
[SPEAKER_01]: us about 500 acres of impacted sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, if we want to reforest
a million acres, this might not be the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is getting a lot of that work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to really need to ramp up
what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just really briefly talk about
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned we have a Bureau of Invasive
Species and Ecosystem Health in DEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got folks out there serving for
invasive species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do really rely on citizen scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to mention here,
IMAP Invasive is a great resource for
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know about it, it's a way to
report invasive species that you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your submissions will be reviewed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not sure what it is,
you can still put it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a DEC staff member is going to look at
it and confirm or deny what you see out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a great resource for folks
to connect them with some technical
[SPEAKER_01]: experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our forest health email is also a way to
email pictures and questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are local partnerships for
regional invasive species management,
[SPEAKER_01]: or PRISM, that are grassroots networks for
managing invasive species across New York
[SPEAKER_01]: that DEC funds and are local experts at
some of the invasive species in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've gotten invasive species
questions, there are a lot of resources
[SPEAKER_01]: out there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DEC is here to help as well as our
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is all that I had today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fantastic, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter will field some questions,
and I will set out a poll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thanks very much, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks back to Tim also for a lot of
great information.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please discuss how the CLCPA limits offset
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mentioned this briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not an expert in the offset
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that the CLCPA, in terms of its
mandatory, if you were to set up a
[SPEAKER_01]: mandatory market where folks are able to
offset, it limits the distance that those
[SPEAKER_01]: offsets could be placed from where that
emission source is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's an important part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also it's important to note that
in terms of statewide sequestration and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon neutrality goal by 2050,
we're not looking at offsets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more the total sequestration rate for
New York Forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's an important distinction
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has the Department of Lands and Forests
consulted with the Department of Ag and
[SPEAKER_02]: Markets on goals for afforestation or
reforestation of agricultural areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there specific strategies?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a great outcome from the
forestry panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was working directly with Ag and
Markets on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've collaborated quite a bit in
terms of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still working on creating
prioritization of areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think some of the work that's been
done by private groups on TNC,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, trying to identify those
marginal lands that are not currently in
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural production, that would be
ideal for creating forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have definitely worked with Ag and
Markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll continue to, especially with
their soil and water conservation
[SPEAKER_01]: districts, which really have a lot of on
the ground knowledge in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the status of 480B and 480C?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they enacted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can we get more information?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were recommended by the forestry
panel, 480B and 480C.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say here in terms of the CLCPA and
our climate work is that the scoping plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I mentioned earlier, is being
developed and will be released for public
[SPEAKER_01]: comment in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in January of 2022 in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recommendations that came out
of the forest panel's work are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two recommendations that were
created in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not enacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just currently recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan will be available for public
comment all of next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd look for the legislature to move
on those if it's something that they
[SPEAKER_01]: prioritize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another question about the CLCPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the CLCPA or any current proposed
legislation take dear management and dear
[SPEAKER_02]: impact on forest regeneration into
account?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the recommendations, we do talk about
dear management and regeneration issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though I would say that it is not a prime
focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the work that we've done
to regenerate New York talks about more
[SPEAKER_01]: about excluding deer from regeneration
areas through fencing practices and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and does not directly talk about
reducing populations of herds across New
[SPEAKER_01]: York State.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since New York State does not have a
licensure program for foresters,
[SPEAKER_02]: how will the state bring in loggers or
other folks that do not have training into
[SPEAKER_02]: plans to improve silver culture for carbon
sequestration?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we don't have a licensing program for
foresters across New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do have is a longstanding
cooperating forester program at DEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks that are on that list are folks
that cooperate with DEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a set of requirements in terms
of education to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're working on getting training
directly to those members as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: forestry professionals in general in this
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that some recent grants
have started and we're hoping to roll out
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you've partially answered this,
but clearly it's on people's minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an anticipated timeline for
implementation of legislative
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities for landowners under the
CLCPA?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the plan, the plan,
the scoping plan will be out for public
[SPEAKER_01]: comment for a period of time next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly at the timeline that
that's going to be out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will be 120, 160 day comment
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plan is to finalize that by 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we would hope that the
implementation of those recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: would come soon after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think DEC has a lot of programs in this
area, which I highlighted as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already moving forward and
trying to integrate carbon management into
[SPEAKER_01]: those programs as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're able to do without
legislative approval, we're moving forward
[SPEAKER_01]: with within our DEC programs currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, Brian.

University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
