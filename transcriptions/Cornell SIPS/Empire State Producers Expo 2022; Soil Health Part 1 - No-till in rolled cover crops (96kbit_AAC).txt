[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Crystal and I have a small vegetable
and seed farm here in Johnstown,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York, where we focus primarily on seed
garlic and some small vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have incorporated some ongoing
research of our favorite topic is to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to get a grant from
Northeast SARE to do some of the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing at the Hudson Valley Farm Hub
and to plant vegetables in a vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it would be good to tell the
story a little bit how we got there to
[SPEAKER_01]: begin with and how we ended up,
you know, what our conclusions were from
[SPEAKER_01]: this basically five year journey of trying
to work with planting vegetables to a
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, if I can just find a way to,
here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, Ryan asked me to briefly introduce
for some of the folks that are not as
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with this system is to talk about
the fact that we're rolling and crimping a
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop and trying to plant a
vegetable's fruitage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, some of the principles that we've
all learned from some of the work that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been done extensively with field crops is
that we know that if you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful with this, you want to plant
your fall cover crops early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Means like September 1st is a good date.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to make sure that we are
rolling and crimping, which is this tool
[SPEAKER_01]: that is either mounted before or behind
the tractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see some more because of that later
on when plants are in an entices,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means then they are in full flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not when they have pollinated because
that's when they actually can set seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, cereals have an entices point usually
that last about a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legumes are, we consider to be
indeterminate and there is no real entices
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like there is constant flowering
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it much more difficult to kill that
cover crop and especially under the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about five years ago, with the pro
farmer program at the Hudson Valley Farm
[SPEAKER_01]: Hub, we had a deep interest in seeing how
we could stop tilling and plant a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable directly to a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a number of different cover
crops of which I will just focus right now
[SPEAKER_01]: on the arson winter peas and some of the
hairy vets that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by pure coincidence, as we had so much
land in cover crops and we didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to plant all that acreage into
vegetables, we planted some buckwheat with
[SPEAKER_01]: a no-till drill, two Arthian winter peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were finding is that that
cover crop was killed while the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: we just rolled and crimped was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here what happens with a
no-till drill is that when you slice it
[SPEAKER_01]: every seven inches, it actually provides a
very efficient effective kill to Arshian
[SPEAKER_01]: winter peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we also found with hairy vets as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to accomplish the killing of a
cover crop that is an indeterminate plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to do something more than just
rolling it and crimping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have to slice it without
bringing up soil, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you can see where's the hairy vets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can see the no-till drill
has culters to allow the seeds to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: go into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the seed box is empty for
this particular situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a better slide right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we planted with a very specific
no-till planter, very expensive piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted directly into the hairy vets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We planted sweet corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the Arshian winter peas,
we planted some broccoli and cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's a lot of open ground
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using 100% legume mix,
there is an awful lot of ground that is
[SPEAKER_01]: still exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it looked like right
after planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take a closer look,
you can see that a lot of weeds are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be establishing to the extent where
you're going to lose your crop if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't address the weed issues there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there wasn't a high-residue cultivator,
but a Lilleston rolling cultivator was
[SPEAKER_01]: used that was sitting in the barn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our pro farmers painted it up
nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used that actually quite
successfully to go to the Arshian winter
[SPEAKER_01]: peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Arshian winter peas was not
something that needed a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because it's pretty rough and the
distance between the Lillestons is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: wide, and it didn't do a phenomenal job,
a lot of hoeing was required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even despite the hoeing, the weeds
were getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting to see here,
when you look at the slide, the stake in
[SPEAKER_01]: our August tent, and then we did a
side-by-side comparison between where we
[SPEAKER_01]: did conventional till, you can see that
this crop is wilting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water holding capacity of the soil
is so much greater in the plots where we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't till the conventional till before
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were really fascinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure was much better in that
plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were encouraged to continue that
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here is the kicker, is that in order
to be successful there, we had an army of
[SPEAKER_01]: people hand-hoeing it and keep the weeds
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So conclusions really of this whole trial
is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, that legumes are difficult
to grow in crimp, and you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to a kind of a expensive piece
of equipment, which right now is more
[SPEAKER_01]: possible with USDA grants that have been
made to make no-till as well as available
[SPEAKER_01]: to your USDA office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage everybody to talk to their
local USDA agent if it's possible to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: for a grant to get a machine like that in
your county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult to control weeds unless you
have access to the equipment that can deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with high residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are high residue cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a Lilison rolling cultivator is not
the ideal piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: High residue cultivators are very specific
and get a lot closer to the crop and allow
[SPEAKER_01]: you to do much better with weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we found was that similar
or even better yields were in the no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: plots under the condition that you keep
your weeds under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the positive results that
we had was only accomplished because of
[SPEAKER_01]: very high labor input, which we didn't
feel that did have a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: application yet for organic farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were intrigued and I wanted to
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for 2018, we tried to continue
this trial at Roxbury farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon after rolling, we actually
discovered that the local rye and hairy
[SPEAKER_01]: vets was purchased, was full of weed seeds
and we had to abandon it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here again, it's one of these things
where you learn along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are doing something like this,
you cannot afford to get seed that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: completely clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be more careful in
preparing your seed bed so you have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: clean seed bed, so you also don't have
overwintering weeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in 2019, when we moved to Filio farm
in Johnstown, we were able to obtain a
[SPEAKER_01]: grant through Northeast Cere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we set up an experimental trial with
27 plots whereby the premise was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know we don't have good weed control
with just hairy vets.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about if we mix in a small amount of
treated kale and see if that will provide
[SPEAKER_01]: us with the optimum amount of weed
control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do 20 pounds of treated kale all the
way up to 80 pounds of treated kale and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what difference we will make.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had learned from our colleagues
that do in field crops is that biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: really matters in order to have optimum
weed control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that the biomass of just hairy
vets, especially in the northern regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: is about 2,500 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we learned from our colleagues,
it tastes like, well, you want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: about between 5,000 and 7,000 pounds of
biomass in order to really suppress these
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a randomized way of looking at all
these different seedings replicated three
[SPEAKER_01]: times each particular seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the treated kale and the
hairy vets looked like the following year
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we rolled and crimped it sometime
around the beginning of June when the
[SPEAKER_01]: treated kale was in thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we already right away learned is
that at a very lower rate of treated kale,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hairy vets did very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot which then gave a problem for us
to be able to plant in it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here where the brown spot is,
that is the control plot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could make a comparison between
conventional till and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another aspect of the grant was to be able
to see if we take a regular planter,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we have to modify it in order to
plant under no-till conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things is that you can take
a regular transplanter and plant with
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till, given that you do have a double
disc opener in front of the transplanter,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that you modify the closing wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closing is more of an issue actually under
no-till conditions than opening,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we found, is that these regular,
I'm going to put my mouse right on here,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the regular closing wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a little bit of a bevel there,
a little bit of an edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to replace them with the
old-fashioned closing wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see there's no bevel there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wouldn't start riding on the hard
grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is we had to mount
coulters in front of the transplanter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we used wavy coulters that later
on were replaced with straight coulters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that the straight coulters worked
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see those cinder blocks sitting on
here to provide some extra weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually more of an issue about
the fact that we drove so much on the
[SPEAKER_01]: trial plots in order to get all these
different seedings done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we rolled and crimped twice,
which caused so much compaction that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had to put weight on the coulter wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that under normal conditions,
that should not be as much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really something that was
self-inflicted in a way due to the setup
[SPEAKER_01]: of the trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are planting cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose for Passat, Jan van der Heide of
Bayer Seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a conversation with him and we
wanted a quick closing cabbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that sweet corn is a crop that can
be done relatively successful under those
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to provide weed control
through shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that Passat will be one of
those cabbages that would also establish
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively quickly to provide the shade
that was needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the hairy vetch is not fully
killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not have access to a no-till drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that we used here is a
roller and crimper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that the hairy vetch
started coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cabbage started growing and we started
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The progress of the different cabbages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what really came out of this trial is
inconclusive really that there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the seeding rates and
the eventual yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found that the compaction was a
great limiting factor in order to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: the cabbage to thrive the way that they
should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is definitely something inherent
in the fact that we did this trial the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we did that we didn't see the results that
we would like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, so we counted how many heads we
had and how much they weighed and
[SPEAKER_01]: translated that to yield per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see here, the yields varied
anywhere between 20 to 30,000 pounds to
[SPEAKER_01]: the acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, there was nothing that really
came out that we said like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: we do need a higher rate or a lower rate
of triticale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did, we said like, let's do an
extension of the trial because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: inconclusive data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this one more time and just do
the higher seeding rates with triticale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more time, the conclusions of that
first year of trial with no obvious
[SPEAKER_01]: correlate between the seed mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No obvious difference in population of
that between 20 and 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just another interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vetch seed especially, or again,
it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really don't have to up our
population of vetch to get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I already said that the seed
mixed with the low triticale were lodged
[SPEAKER_01]: and that the yield was negatively impacted
and that conventional planting equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: can successfully be adapted for planting
to a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other fun thing we did actually was
not by design completely because we grew
[SPEAKER_01]: some shallots next to the garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this field was in garlic the previous
year and the shallots were harvested later
[SPEAKER_01]: than the garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ended up planting one bed of
triticale and vetch about a month later
[SPEAKER_01]: than the vetch, then the triticale and
vetch on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see in the spring a phenomenal
difference in development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to illustrate how important it is
to get your cover crop established in time
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we rolled and crimped this time
with the high, with the 80 to 100 pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: of triticale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had phenomenal coverage in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up hand planting winter squash in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chose winter squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that nitrogen might become an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since winter squash has a lower need
for nitrogen than cabbage, we hope to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe the rates were even higher than
80 to 100 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually didn't exactly know what the
rates were.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see here, we covered them in
order to protect the weekends cucumber
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles with floating row covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants soon petered out and weeds
actually took over even with the heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this was not a great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conclusions is that cereal cover
crops to be used for voting and crimping
[SPEAKER_01]: under the organic growing conditions is
really not advisable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless you and Sarah will be talking
about this after this presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you plant a legume, also at the
Hudson Valley Pharma, we had very good
[SPEAKER_01]: luck with growing edamame and green beans
after growing a straight crop of rye and
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling and crimping that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that worked well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you try to plant cabbage or
cauliflower, broccoli, sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: and even winter squash, you really need to
find a way to plant that directly to a
[SPEAKER_01]: legume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the problem is when you only use
a legume, you really need to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill that cover crop effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you need either to slice
it with a no-till drill or other options
[SPEAKER_01]: would be to tarp it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think later this afternoon,
we'll be talking about tarping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tarping will be an effective way to kill
your legume and would also kill any weeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are still present within your legume
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that ultimately when you don't
tarp and even when you can kill it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till drill, I would say planting
directly to a legume would be mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: feasible if the weeds can be controlled
with a high-residue cultivator that can go
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit closer to the crops than,
say, a Lilleston rolling cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need my full time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually am very happy to open it up
for questions that people have regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to go back to slides if
people weren't completely clear about
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what was being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Jean-Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, more time for questions and
discussion is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did well there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very succinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing those iterations
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty impressive how you've stayed
persistent to continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean that next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for folks to put stuff in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean that next year you will not
trial the system or you'll try to acquire
[SPEAKER_03]: high residue or what would be the next
step for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we're going to go one year back
to introducing some more bare fallow
[SPEAKER_01]: system because one of the weeds was not
really very clear in the picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the one persistent weed in our system
was medium red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to flesh that out a little
bit is to reduce the enormous seed bank we
[SPEAKER_01]: have of red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people say like they, they scratch
their head like, wow, we have a seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: of gallon soca or, you know, and we have a
seed bank of red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't ask me how that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it wasn't a hayfield for about 20,
25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we turned it over into crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding is that mostly what
we're dealing with right now are either
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial weeds or we have Rebecca,
for example, as a wheat and medium red
[SPEAKER_01]: clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next year we are going to do some
intensive cover cropping and with some
[SPEAKER_01]: bare fellows in between to clean these
fields up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see that red clover in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to follow up on that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple of questions in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve asked, why triticale versus wheat or
cereal rye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was one of these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was that triticale might flower a
little bit later than rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this was based on hearsay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that proved to be
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to do a little bit later rolling
and crimping, hoping that the later you
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling crimp the vetch, maybe the more
effective, the killing of the vetch would
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did not prove to be true either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no reason to switch rye for
triticale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Robert asks, what is considered a high
residue cultivator?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a similar question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your experience with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we could talk more about high
residue cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there is a great picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book published by Ser.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would actually Google high residue
cultivator, it might come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great picture that would show you
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it works the way it works is that
people who are familiar with a no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: drill, especially the John Deere type
no-till drill, there are press wheels
[SPEAKER_01]: running in front of the colter that
actually hold the crop residue down before
[SPEAKER_01]: the colter hits it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in this case, the colter wheels,
and there will be two of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: are holding the residue down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the knife slides underneath the
crop residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So holding that cover crop in place is
really important that you don't start
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the crop residue in front of your
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by just holding this down and slicing
it and then go underneath with a knife,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what makes this thing work really
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an expensive piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I priced one out and that's already back
in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then a two row was already
$14,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given where prices are right now,
I don't know, a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the things that could also
be looked at to obtain through USDA if
[SPEAKER_01]: people are really interested if a number
of growers come together and say like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would like to have USDA purchase
something like that with us, along with a
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till drill, this would be a roller
crimper.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tools that really help with soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I'm not discouraged
about is that if you can work out the
[SPEAKER_01]: kinks, it does contribute tremendously to
soil health, soil aggregation,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a field that is not being tilled is so
much greater than on the conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: till.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you about flail mowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some people say that they're
addicted to tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard you say that John Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm addicted to flail mowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw it looks good afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found that it kills things like
vatsch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that seemed to be like one of your
primary issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if there's trade-offs there
because things break down quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But have you thought about that or is
there a role there for mowing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's an excellent
suggestion, Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially it would make the
cultivation afterwards so much easier
[SPEAKER_01]: because now you're breaking up the hairy
vatsch in smaller pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess what it was is that we
were stubborn in the sense that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping that somehow miraculously a cover
crop would control the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just plant and walk away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of the attitude we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not advisable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know that you're not going to
control the weeds anyway and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to a high residue cultivator,
flail mowing is a really great option
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can get in there with a
Lilleston rolling cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, there is more ability than
to allow it to work the way it's supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to work by doing some hilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the stems are long, it actually
prevents the Lilleston rolling cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: from doing the work it's supposed to do,
which is the hilling parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of clogs up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at the end of the row,
you're out there with a crowbar and
[SPEAKER_01]: removing quite a bit of the arson winter
peas or the hairy vatsch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works, but it doesn't really work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, yes, flail mowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been doing it for a long time,
right, Ryan?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of our trials, yeah, that was our
go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were fortunate to have one that was
kind of side-mounted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you noticed in your case,
you had it on the rear, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're driving over the cover crop
prior to trying to roll it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that... You didn't try to
drive backwards or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: did you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an issue with mowing or rolling for
termination, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you have a heavier tractor and
the flail mower is behind the tires,
[SPEAKER_01]: that area does not get flail mold as well,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are not too many front-mounted flail
mowers around that I am aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So side-mounting definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you very much for having me here
today, Ryan, to talk to you about the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential of cereal rye mulch to suppress
white mold in no-till soybean and dry
[SPEAKER_02]: beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I'm going to give you a basic
overview of the white mold facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're concentrating on the disease
white mold, and we'll just review some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the strategies and tactics to control the
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leads into the rationale for our
experiment, looking at the potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: rolled-print cereal rye to add to the
control of this disease in leguminous
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll then talk about the field trials
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing this for several years at
Geneva, and the results have been
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the rationale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about how we designed the
experiment and our approach and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the results, not just on disease,
but also on the trade-offs of wheat
[SPEAKER_02]: suppression and on crop biomass and on pod
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about the implications of
our findings for disease management in
[SPEAKER_02]: leguminous crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a refresher, white mold is
caused by the fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may know the symptoms of this disease
already if there's white, cottony,
[SPEAKER_02]: fluffy mycelia that you'll find on pods of
dry beans and soya beans and snap beans,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the fungus has a very broad host
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can affect over 400 plant species,
many of which are vegetables and field
[SPEAKER_02]: crops found in our New York cropping
rotations, which makes rotating out to a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-host quite problematic to provide an
opportunity to potentially reduce the
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculum density in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, often crops have very low tolerance
for white mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in snap bean crops,
the tolerance for crop rejection could be
[SPEAKER_02]: as low as 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over that 2% threshold, if pods are
affected, that could lead to crop bypass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to get the management
very correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do we worry about white mold apart
from crop bypassing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have direct crop loss in those
crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the disease causes premature pod
obsessions, so they just fall off before
[SPEAKER_02]: we get to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we reduce the number of harvestable
pods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also reduce the number of beans per
pod because even though pods might be
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested, they would have less energy
going into those pods and therefore less
[SPEAKER_02]: beans being formed within the pods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the beans might be formed,
but they have poor quality that because
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't have enough energy during
formation, they might be quite shriveled
[SPEAKER_02]: and not suitable for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have to consider contamination
of the fungal parts, such as the
[SPEAKER_02]: sclerotia, these black resting bodies of
the fungus that you see here in the beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that slows down the process of sorting
out beans from sclerotia because of
[SPEAKER_02]: course, no one wants to find sclerotia in
their can of dried beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a direct crop losses,
but there's also indirect crop losses as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get the production of this
sclerotia, the resting body of the fungus
[SPEAKER_02]: that survives in the soil on the disease
plant parts, they fall back into the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface and then form the inoculum for the
next susceptible crops in the rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's setting up disease loss for future
crops as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to think about direct and
indirect crop losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for white mold, for all diseases,
we can represent diseases by this disease
[SPEAKER_02]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the role of the pathogen,
the role of the environment and the role
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those three factors have to come
together to get disease in your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: For white mold, the pathogen we consider
is usually sufficient in the soil at
[SPEAKER_02]: sufficient densities to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't alter management too much by
trying to reduce the pathogen level in
[SPEAKER_02]: most cases, mostly because of that very
broad host range.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant, there's really no significant
resistance or immunity within many of our
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pathogen, the pathogen in a plant,
it can be a really large plant species,
[SPEAKER_02]: including leguminous crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the environment, well, that really
regulates whether we get a white mold
[SPEAKER_02]: epidemic or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it requires very mild temperatures,
very rainy-type conditions, which we are
[SPEAKER_02]: increasingly getting within our New York
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's clearly driven by that dominant
influence in spring and summer conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The life cycle of the fungus starts as
these black sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the structure the fungus uses
to survive between seasons in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically just a wrapped up piece of
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they put this black melanized
hard coat around that to dissuade any
[SPEAKER_02]: degradation by microorganisms and other
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the main driver of a noxious
kiln for the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those sclerotia, when the conditions are
right, germinate into these what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: apothecia, but there's these little
mushroom type structures, pale brown
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the surface of those pale brown
mushrooms, we get the production of
[SPEAKER_02]: ascospores, which are basically colorless
balls that are wind dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those ascospores can then only infect the
flowers, of our veins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they use those dead dying flowers
as a nutrient source to be able to infect
[SPEAKER_02]: the green tissue directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether that be a pod, whether that be
a stem, it can cause chaos on a variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: different plant parts as long as that
infected petal falls on that plant part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we get the typical symptoms of
white mold, these bleached necrotic
[SPEAKER_02]: lesions, and the signs of the pathogen,
which are these white, cottony,
[SPEAKER_02]: fluffy mycelia, which then ball up,
become black, and then fall onto the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I mentioned the role of the
environment, and this is really
[SPEAKER_02]: illustrated just, for example,
over the season between 2014 and 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 2014, it was a white mold year,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was rainy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All year long, and we got a lot of
significant loss in our leguminous crops
[SPEAKER_02]: from white mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015, didn't see much white mold
because it was cool, but the rain happened
[SPEAKER_02]: very early in the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that affected crop stands, which
affected the microclimatic conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So crops didn't reach their full
potential, and they didn't get canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: closure.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2016, the same happened, but it was just
hot and dry all year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, in 2017, wet and cool all
season long, and it was a white mold year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get these dramatic fluctuations in
white mold epidemics between years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we do know for white mold is that
the inoculum comes predominantly from
[SPEAKER_02]: within the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the ascospores don't fly in from down
the valley or generally the field next
[SPEAKER_02]: door, the inoculum or sclerotia that's in
the soil in that field contribute to the
[SPEAKER_02]: ascospores that are being produced,
and those ascospores get caught by the
[SPEAKER_02]: crop canopy and are able to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the ascospores do escape the crop
canopy and get into the wind currents,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're quickly broken down because
they're colorless, and they're able to be
[SPEAKER_02]: degraded by ultraviolet light quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to concentrate on management,
we know that we need to concentrate our
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts on trying to reduce the sclerotial
density within the field itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: which gets back to our potential for using
rolled crimp cereal rye to control white
[SPEAKER_02]: mold in a field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of management for white mold,
this is what we know so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got these strategies, so things that
we can do prior to planting to reduce the
[SPEAKER_02]: sclerotial inoculum and reduce the risk of
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have tactics, things that we
can do within the season as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's take a closer look at that before
we move into the rationale for our rolled
[SPEAKER_02]: crimp cereal rye research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for strategies, we know that increasing
our frequency of non-hosts, if we've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with white mold in that field in
the past, is going to reduce the
[SPEAKER_02]: sclerotial inoculum because they won't
have an opportunity to infect those hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only real non-hosts in our cropping
rotations, unfortunately, are corn and
[SPEAKER_02]: grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we do rotate to those crops to get
the full benefit problem in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing our sclerotial inoculum,
we also need to think about weed control
[SPEAKER_02]: because many of our broadly native weeds
are also hosts to sclerotidia sclerotiorum
[SPEAKER_02]: and can also get diseased, form sclerotia,
and sclerotia fall back onto the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to think about weed control
when rotating to these non-hosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not negating the effect of that
crop rotation for disease control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, strategies, we can also use
techniques, agronomic techniques that may
[SPEAKER_02]: have trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we could use wider row
spacings if it fits planters and
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesters to get more airflow through the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could use decreased plant populations
as well, but again, trade-off with yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: less disease, less yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could also ensure that we get effective
weed management so we're not clogging up
[SPEAKER_02]: our rows with weeds so we can maximize the
airflow through the crop canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're available, we could use
upright varieties, again, with the main
[SPEAKER_02]: target of moving airflow through the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we also have tactics within the
season that we can use.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a range of different fungicides
in different frat groups or different
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicide resistant action committee
groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that represents different modes of
action of the fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we could rotate between if we wanted
to consider synthetic fungicides for
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also know from our research that to
get the most out of our fungicides,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to be really accurate with our
timing of that first application with
[SPEAKER_02]: early flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because covering and protecting our
blossoms are the critical point because
[SPEAKER_02]: our blossoms serve as that inoculum source
after they fall from the flowers onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: other plant parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to look at this,
the potential control of white mold from a
[SPEAKER_02]: different angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of controlling the flowers,
which most of our techniques do through
[SPEAKER_02]: fungicides, we wanted to see if sclerotia
could be inhibited from germinating to
[SPEAKER_02]: start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sclerotia are generally within the
first top inch of the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those sclerotia that contribute to the
disease in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lower sclerotia in the soil profile won't
germinate sufficiently long stalks,
[SPEAKER_02]: what there's these little stalks,
containing the mushrooms to get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to try and control or try and
inhibit the germination of the sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't get ascospores to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is in principle done in other
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in the Pacific Northwest,
they use chemigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put fungicides through the
irrigation water to do just this,
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent the germination of sclerotia into
these little mushroom type structures to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent ascospores.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we wanted to do it through potentially
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, we don't have a lot of
irrigation infrastructure in New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what other ways could we achieve the
same aim and also get the benefits of
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops in terms of soil health and
climate resilience?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the objective of our research over the
last few years has been to quantify the
[SPEAKER_02]: efficacy of rolled crimp cereal rye mulch
on white mold, specifically the major
[SPEAKER_02]: disease of our leguminous crops,
weed populations, biomass and yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, we're interested in those
trade-offs between the biotic stresses
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting our legumes, disease and weeds
and biomass and yield components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm talking about rolled crimp
cereal rye, I'm sure you know about this
[SPEAKER_02]: potential one pass system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're planting our cereal rye in early
fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're letting it grow in fall and then it
will overwinter.
[SPEAKER_02]: In spring, it will grow very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're rolling and crimping it to
achieve a mulch layer on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using a roller crimper bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see here, it's basically just a
heavy cylinder with these imprinted
[SPEAKER_02]: rollers imprinted in a chevron type
pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you go over the cereal rye,
it can kill it by crimping and damaging
[SPEAKER_02]: the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it won't, it will die in place when
it's pushed down and formed that mulch
[SPEAKER_02]: layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can then plant directly into that mulch
layer, either in a one pass system or it
[SPEAKER_02]: could also be in a two pass system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought it had application to
directly harvested dry beans, because for
[SPEAKER_02]: directly harvested dry beans, they would
be harvested in one pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would not need wind growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would need wind growing beforehand
because the mulch layer could of course
[SPEAKER_02]: interrupt in that wind growing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the system has already been optimized
in terms of its agronomic attributes for
[SPEAKER_02]: soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were interested in A, exploring this
system for white mold control in both
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible crops, but also looking at,
could it be possible in dry beans?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rationale for this, for white mold
control, is that we would like to know
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the cereal rye mulch layer on the
soil surface has the ability to reduce
[SPEAKER_02]: light to the soil surface, because we know
that light and the ratios of light quality
[SPEAKER_02]: are important in the germination of the
sclerotia into these little apothecia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by reducing the light, perhaps we might
get less germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they are, formed perhaps at
lower frequency, we might get dilution of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ascus spores because it's harder for
them to be released into the wind currents
[SPEAKER_02]: through the rye mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's other benefits in
the rolled print cereal rye mulch layer as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, such as potentially weed
suppression, soil health, moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: and reduced tillage as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in conventional systems, every time we
till the soil, we're essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: delivering a new population of sclerotia
to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we saw before, those sclerotia that
are right on that soil surface within an
[SPEAKER_02]: inch or so have the potential to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: By bringing more sclerotia up,
we're just bringing new sclerotia for more
[SPEAKER_02]: disease every season by tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our trials were located at the Research
North facilities at Cornell Agritech in
[SPEAKER_02]: Geneva.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did was we planted strips of
cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cultivar aristuc at three bushels
per acre on the 18th of September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done this over multiple years,
but for ease of letting you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: results, I'm just going to concentrate on
the results of one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our plots were 40 feet long by 204 feet
wide in this season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we rolled and crimped our cereal rye
on the 31st of May.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Jean-Paul said, we didn't let it go to
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We rolled and crimped it at 75% anthesis
to soft-dose stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our main crops were planted as a bit
later than we would have liked on the 7th
[SPEAKER_02]: of June because it managed to rain
prolifically just after we rolled and
[SPEAKER_02]: crimped it the day after.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had two different crops, soya beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was variety Viking and black bean,
which was variety zenith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we planted our black beans at the
commercial, conventional no-till phase of
[SPEAKER_02]: eight seeds per foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both crops were planted with a 30-inch
row spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially we're comparing fallow
areas that were not planted to cereal rye
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch, cereal rye in fall, compared to our
rolled crimped cereal rye plots,
[SPEAKER_02]: two treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the process where you can see that
the cereal rye has reduced a huge amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of biomass since it's planting in fall and
into spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see our tractor going up and
down our plots, rolling and crimping it
[SPEAKER_02]: into a mulch layer on the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what our plots looked like in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had significant biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we're rotating our treatments
up and down our field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what it looked like after we'd
rolled and crimped the entire paddock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing we wanted to have a
look at was the effect of that cereal rye
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch on plant density, so crop
populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that dry beans, there was no
significant effect from the rye mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar plant density or plant populations
in the fallow and the cereal rye mulch
[SPEAKER_02]: plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And surprisingly in the soybean plots,
we did get 45% less plant density in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also looked at crop biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we know how many plants have
established, we wanted to look at their
[SPEAKER_02]: vigour as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did this mid-season, 19th of July,
and later in the season on the 31st of
[SPEAKER_02]: August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in dry beans, in the 19th of July,
mid-season, we had significantly less,
[SPEAKER_02]: 63% less biomass in the rye plots compared
to our fallow plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a similar effect on soybeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we had that plant
population effect earlier in the season as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by the 31st of August, there was no
significant effect on biomass between the
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch and the fallow areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: In dry beans, but we still had a legacy
effect from that plant population and
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially plant vigour effect earlier on
in the season in our soybeans,
[SPEAKER_02]: 27% less in the rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in terms of yield, we hand harvested
plants within different sub-samples across
[SPEAKER_02]: our trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at pod weight and pod number
on the 12th of September.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for dry beans, we did get a significant
increase in pod weight in the rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But pod number was not significantly
different between the treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So potentially we had significantly
heavier pods because we had the same
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in our soybeans, our pod weight
was again reduced in our rye plots by
[SPEAKER_02]: nearly 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our pod number was not significantly
different between the mulch and the fallow
[SPEAKER_02]: plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we also had some, we've seen
repeatedly some interesting crop maturity
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, especially in soybeans as well
from the rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this section, we have in the
foreground of the picture, you can see our
[SPEAKER_02]: rye mulch plot and the crop is still green
and kicking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is well into September.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in our fallow area, we're getting
some essence of our crop in soybeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So potentially the rye mulch plots held
onto moisture for longer, which made the
[SPEAKER_02]: crop kick on for longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we also saw significant impact on weed
suppression from our rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of broad leaf weed biomass at
the end of the season on the 21st of
[SPEAKER_02]: September, we had a significant weed
population in our crop, but there was 65%
[SPEAKER_02]: less in the rye plots than the fallow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were doing a good job with weed
suppression and was the case in soybeans
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably higher in soybeans, probably
because it was a much more lush canopy and
[SPEAKER_02]: which probably provided more weed
suppression on its own as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's get to the crux of the issue,
which was what was the effect on white
[SPEAKER_02]: mold?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at the incidence of white
mold on plants and pods in the mulch plots
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the fallow plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in soybeans, we had an incidence in
the fallow plots of 8.4%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could not find white mold in the rye
plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar effects in the dry beans
significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at incidence of white mold on
plants in the fallow plots compared to the
[SPEAKER_02]: rye plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to look at the effect of the cereal
rye on sclerotia, we dug into the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: at six sand field plots, which we filled
with sclerotia, six per plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now these sclerotia were ready to
germinate once they had the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that we condition them in the
laboratory to be able to make them ready
[SPEAKER_02]: to germinate if they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look at the results of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we were looking at for was whether
the sclerotia had germinated and if they
[SPEAKER_02]: had germinated properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by that, I mean that they've germinated
with their small stalks, the stall stalks,
[SPEAKER_02]: plus the disc, the apothecia, which
contains those ascospores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we found was consistent between
the soy beans and the black beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, the incidence of
germination that resulted in fully formed
[SPEAKER_02]: apothecia with that disc and ascospores
was significantly higher in our fallow
[SPEAKER_02]: plots compared to our rye mulch plots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also this case in black bean, but the
opposite was true for non-functional
[SPEAKER_02]: production of stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by non-functional again, I mean that
the sclerotia have germinated,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they did not form that disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore no ascospores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have more in the cereal rye plots
compared to the fallow plots in both the
[SPEAKER_02]: soy beans and the black beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a reminder, we have in the rye
plots reductions in the functional
[SPEAKER_02]: apothecia, the incidence of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what a functional apothecia
looks like, fully expand disc.
[SPEAKER_02]: But significant increases in the sclerotia
that are germinated to non-functional
[SPEAKER_02]: types.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what they look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they germinate, they're reaching for
the sky, but they just don't have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: energy to be able to produce their
apothecia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we believe this energy exhaustion of
sclerotia could be potentially useful in a
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till situation because again,
those sclerotia, that are only within the
[SPEAKER_02]: top inch contribute to disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're not bringing up new
populations of sclerotia by tillage,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to essentially purge that
upper layer of sclerotia, which could
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to disease in future crops,
which may lead to a reduction in soil
[SPEAKER_02]: borne inoculants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one aspect of our further
research into this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in summary, there's fewer newer
fungicides, fewer new tactics that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used in conventional systems being
produced on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we believe not relying on one tactic
or one strategy is the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially for these recalcitrant type
diseases that have been with us for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need that systems types approach to be
able to make incremental gain in disease
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rolled crimp cereal rye mulch could offer
that ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It provides wheat suppression.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've demonstrated white mold control and
potentially reductions in soil borne
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculum, but the system needs to be
optimized for its agronomic attributes
[SPEAKER_02]: with yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'd like to acknowledge the
fantastic help of my own team,
[SPEAKER_02]: the evade team, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the funding of the New York State
Tribune Council and USDA Organic
[SPEAKER_02]: Transitions Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our collaborators from the Ryan
Program and also Brian Brown from the New
[SPEAKER_02]: York State IPM Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super innovative work there in
applications of the rye system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to learn what you're finding
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take a look at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have several minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're due to end around 1.05.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do invite folks to use the chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: One question that's in there is,
how do you think snappings would do in
[SPEAKER_03]: this system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually, I'm going to throw that
question back to you, Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they would be held upright
enough for the direct harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it would depend upon the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably depend on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope they don't get more
susceptible to root ruts because if
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more moisture underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good rotation would be the key there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is anecdotal and Sean Paul speaking,
but we did in 2017 successfully grew snap
[SPEAKER_01]: beans through cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we thought the difficulty would be
that cereal rye would be picked up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: bean harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no trash coming into the
harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we had actually relatively good
germination there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is only one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Sean Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, you shared results from the one
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there much variation in this trial
from year to year?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had very similar results over
two years, which were published.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're moving on to another experiment
to determine if it's the rye residue
[SPEAKER_02]: itself or is it just rye, for example,
producing inhibitory effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this time we have different treatments
of just fallow versus the old crimp cereal
[SPEAKER_02]: rye mulch versus tilling in the rye as
well before planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also moving into determining,
so looking at this crop for white mulch
[SPEAKER_02]: control in sunflowers as well as also a
significant disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This concept of sclerotia in the soil and
then bringing them back up to the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the analogy that I went straight
to my mind was in weed management and
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing new weed seeds to the surface and
bringing new sclerotia to the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of those analogies.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long can the sclerotia reside in the
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've actually got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of the data on that is from the
Midwest, where it's very different
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've set up our own experiment,
which has been going two years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, they're kicking on just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's more degradation in sclerotia
at depth rather than on the surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably they're more capable of being
eaten, so to speak, or degraded by
[SPEAKER_02]: different microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keeping them low, keeping them deep in
the soil profile also will enhance their
[SPEAKER_02]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far in our experiments, we've got
another year to go on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least four to five years, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that was a long version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
