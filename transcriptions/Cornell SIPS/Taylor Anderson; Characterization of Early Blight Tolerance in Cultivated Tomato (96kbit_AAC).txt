[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so today I'm going to talk
about my efforts to characterize early
[SPEAKER_00]: blight tolerance within cultivated tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early blight is caused by Alternaria
tomatophila or Alternaria saloni.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a necrotrophic fungal pathogen
within the Daphidia mycetes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This disease is widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant pathologist described it as
present wherever tomatoes are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may or may not be true,
but it certainly is a problem in humid and
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-arid environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance to this disease is
quantitatively inherited, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms underlying that resistance
remain poorly understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that there isn't
substantial resistance within cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, while there is no single gene
resistance that provides full resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is quite a bit of resistance that's
already been integrated in cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while some mapping studies have mapped
QTL associated with tolerance or partial
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, to early blight, they
generally have been in crosses with
[SPEAKER_00]: unadapted wild species germplasm,
and they haven't really advanced into the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs past that wide cross
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result, we don't really have
any markers that are predictive for use in
[SPEAKER_00]: everyday breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the goal for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my objective for the last year
and a half or so, is to develop some PCR
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that are predictive of the major
QTL providing resistance to early blight
[SPEAKER_00]: and then test them in several populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's interesting about the early
blight disease of tomato is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to it seems to be somewhat
tissue specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different responses in the
foliage and in the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to break this down during the
course of my discussion today in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the foliar and stem tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with this, several years ago,
Martha began breeding for Northeast
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted fresh market tomato lines that
were resistant to early blight and also
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to septoria leaf spot and late
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: She integrated in particular resistance in
the stems, but also found that that
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance conferred some foliar tolerance
as well under a lower spray regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most marked differences in the
stems themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top here, we have the resistance
genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our resistant control.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there are lesions that are
present, but they don't tend to elongate
[SPEAKER_00]: along the length of the stem like they do
in the susceptible material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because if this
lesion elongates and hits a leaf axle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole leaf tends to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the same case with the fruits,
you actually provide some fruit resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: by having this form of tolerance because
the pathogens tends to sort of enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit through the top, through the stem
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see here in this upper
right hand corner, the fruit is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: rotting from the stem end out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to map the resistance to this
or in order to map that stem resistance in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular and also to look at the foliar
resistance, I worked with three parents
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to be talking about these
throughout the course of this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first one is 151095-146.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Cornell triple resistant line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same one that's pictured here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have two Ohio processing tomato
lines, Ohio 7663 and Ohio 7536.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from David Francis' breeding
program at Ohio State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio 7536 for all intents and purposes is
considered our fully susceptible control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ohio 7663 actually has some form of
foliar tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should note though that neither of them
are really truly fully susceptible because
[SPEAKER_00]: they are from a breeding program that's
applied and is in a humid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of breeding material that's
meant to become a cultivar, it's never
[SPEAKER_00]: fully susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to do this mapping
population or in order to do this mapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted out two mapping populations in
the summer of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: An F2 cross between 151095-146 and 7663
and a triple cross that involves all three
[SPEAKER_00]: of these parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I inoculated them with a backpack sprayer
full of Alternaria North Carolina number
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 is Alternaria tamatophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did separate phenotyping for stem
and foliar traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem is on the one to five scale and
foliar is on a zero to 100 continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also measured several important
or what I thought would be important
[SPEAKER_00]: covariates such as fruit size,
fruit sets, fruit counts, and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, when you look through the
literature, you see that as the fruit size
[SPEAKER_00]: goes up and as the number of fruit go up
and intranode length goes down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you become more susceptible to early
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from these populations, I genotyped
about half of the F2 population and about
[SPEAKER_00]: a third of the triple cross population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with GBS markers, but about a
year later it became apparent that we
[SPEAKER_00]: needed some or we were missing some
genotypes in some key areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we threw some SNPs out using the
Solcap SNP set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was able to map resistances to
the stem phase of this disease on one,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minor effect QTL are somewhere in the
range of six to seven, six to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real killer is this guy up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This chromosome nine QTL explains about a
third of the variation for the stem trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's major effect locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the foliar form of the disease,
we've got hits on one, five, eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all about between five and 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the lower end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's consistent with the literature
and consistent with what we see in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of distribution for this phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also significant interactions
between the QTL and between these QTL and
[SPEAKER_00]: other regions in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the purposes of keeping this
discussion short, I'm only going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on three QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on one, five, and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our biggest effect additive
loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to note also that the QTL
and chromosome one and nine also pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: for this stem phase of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to confirm the QTL effects,
we did a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start with, I looked at the genotypes
for the F2 individuals that were used for
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I selected, based on these QTL
regions, for F2 individuals that were
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous for all three of the QTL
regions in all possible combinations where
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one in this case is the CU07126 allele,
or sorry, CU151095-146 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three is the Ohio 7663 allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be using this coding
throughout as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I planted the F23 family, so the
progeny of these selected F2 individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a replicated trial this year into
Williger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sprayed them again with Altenaria
entomatophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did phenotyping for the stem and
foliar traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to start with, if we just look at the
distribution of the stem phenotype about
[SPEAKER_00]: the marker scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the genotypes here, again,
are one, two, and three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that there is a significant
difference for the phenotype between the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, when we did that additional
genotyping using the Solcap SNP set,
[SPEAKER_00]: the locations for the QTL shifted a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here are the updated QTL locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that I did select for
homozygosity at the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, when we changed those
positions, we introduced some
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygosity at the QTL locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, the fit on chromosome one is
significantly better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what may be more convincing is if we
just rank the F23 families by their
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we've got the stem
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got families, F23 families on rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you move down the table,
you have increasing disease in the stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Tukey multiple comparison is used to
differentiate the families statistically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this coding I've used here is a single
plus indicates homozygous for the
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant form of the allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plus minus indicates heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a minus indicates homozygous for the
susceptible allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the three loci or QTL on
chromosomes one, five, and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, what we see is on
chromosome nine, that major effect locus
[SPEAKER_00]: is perfectly associated with the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the same thing for foliar,
ranking again from most resistant to most
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you again see that the distribution of
resistant alleles tends to be associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with plants that are resistant,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for the markers, chromosomes
one, five, and nine QTL, we do see
[SPEAKER_00]: significant differences on the phenotype
as a function of the marker scores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this a different way and using
a different population, I generated a
[SPEAKER_00]: back-cross one individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is back-cross to the recurrent
parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use background genome selection to
clean up this material as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually in selecting, we were able to
eliminate all but three chromosomes from
[SPEAKER_00]: play essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the remainder of the genome is fixed
homozygous for this Cornell recurrent
[SPEAKER_00]: parent genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those three chromosomes that are
still segregating, two of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome five and chromosome nine,
which are where our QTL lie, or two of our
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put a segregating population out,
which is the self progeny of that BC1
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the stem trait, again,
we see nice separation here where as you
[SPEAKER_00]: move from the Cornell genotype to the Ohio
genotype, you become more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for the foliar, we looked at
the chromosome five and chromosome nine
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, statistically significant
separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, for the last thing that
hasn't been yet confirmed, this chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: one locus, we chose an F2 population,
or excuse me, an F2 individual from this
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, this Ohio 7663 by 151095-146 and
crossed it back to a different Ohio
[SPEAKER_00]: parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This F2 happened to be fixed for
chromosomes five and nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're actually amplifying
artificially the effect of the chromosome
[SPEAKER_00]: one locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see a significant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that I've conveyed that there's
statistically significant results for
[SPEAKER_00]: these three QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about visual or practical
significance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to use this in a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're going to say a line is
resistant, if a farmer or a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: receives this material that claims to be
resistant and it's not, we're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, I'm going to take you on a
virtual journey back to Freeville,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York in the summer of 2018 on a sunny
day in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to walk through the
replicated trial and abbreviated form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we start with a plot, an F2-3 family
that has zero of the QTL, it's fully
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the plants are not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no foliage left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stems are all infected, dead,
total loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add in a chromosome one QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get some retainment of foliage,
but in general, the plants still look
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the chromosome five locus
or chromosome five QTL on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add in the chromosome nine QTL on
its own, again, this looks pretty awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we zoom in on the stems,
the stems are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as expected, it provided a lot of stem
tolerance, but not a whole lot of foliage
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we start adding QTL together,
though, then we start getting measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: results or practically different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see an enhancement in the ability to
keep the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, we don't have that
chromosome nine locus, and so the stems
[SPEAKER_00]: are still dirty, still infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add in the chromosome five and
chromosome nine together, you get about
[SPEAKER_00]: the same level of foliar tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can actually see there are fewer
of the fruit that are rotting prematurely
[SPEAKER_00]: on the black plastic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that in terms of these orange
and red fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to actually, at this early stage
in the season, if you see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's usually because the infection has
actually separated the fruit from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and so it's ripening on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add all three of the QTL
together, you get a plant that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty darn good compared to that initial
susceptible plant that was completely
[SPEAKER_00]: dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want to point out that I
inoculated this with a backpack spray of
[SPEAKER_00]: full-on material of the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprayed it with overhead irrigation,
and I basically enhanced the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't provide any chemical control
whatsoever because I wanted this disease
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this plant is doing this well,
or if this plot is doing this well,
[SPEAKER_00]: given those conditions, you can imagine
that in a low to moderate spray regime in
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmish field, it could actually be
doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, just talk briefly about
next steps for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've looked at the effects of the QTL,
but I haven't totally controlled for all
[SPEAKER_00]: the background effects yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for that, we really need to
generate some new isogenic lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the background, ideally of both the
Ohio and Cornell material, and test the
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL effects on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're in the process of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to be doing some selective
phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to plant out 1,000 or more
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use genotyping to identify
some individuals that have useful
[SPEAKER_00]: recombinants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to phenotype using a
greenhouse screen you actually see up here
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've got running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also received some sequence data
from the two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to be going through and
looking at the sequences in the QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: locations to try and identify some
candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be adding in some digital
phenotyping work to try and enhance this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually begun using this tool called
Phenom from Mike Gore's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, I'll get to analyzing that
in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we're going to be
creating products with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to use these markers to
generate material that's resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: early blight, late blight septoria,
and bacterial speck, and bacterial spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacterial side of the project is
another part of breeding that I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'd like to thank my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank David Francis' breeding
program for providing some of the material
[SPEAKER_00]: and some support, and my graduate
committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to thank my funding sources,
including Michael Mazzurro, who let me TA
[SPEAKER_00]: for his class.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any questions?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, there was the bat cross population.
[SPEAKER_02]: We seem to lose a lot of signal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any explanation for why that
was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember I told you I planted out a
triple cross population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was supposed to be a BC1 back to
the Ohio parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out the CDOT was not what we
thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually an F2 selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of the genome is already
fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I don't show an effect plot
here, because it's artificially escalated,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of the genome is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not accounting for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess the second one was,
it was nice to see all of the stacked
[SPEAKER_02]: genes, the effects that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it completely additive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you see that there's epistasis
between the loci?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see epistasis between the loci.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a few thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some concerns as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said earlier, the early blight
trait seems to be associated with several
[SPEAKER_00]: plant architecture traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to be sure that what I'm
mapping is not just a change in internode
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's a change in internode
length, you can imagine that there would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an interaction potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it was on chromosome 1,
you would expect to see an interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the internode length and
chromosome 9, stem tolerance QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually pairwise interactions
between all three of the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have begun digging into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't fully fleshed it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really need immortal populations or
mills to test this properly, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your pottery head, all three of the
QTL stacked up, the fence did look great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also looked like the fruit was
later in ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is another association that you
see with early blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if this is due to the
early blight resistance or due to the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the fruit aren't separating from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the infection sort of gets through
the peduncle, it separates the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fruit ripens prematurely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the super susceptible material,
you'll see a lot of ripe fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not actually ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, the seeds wouldn't be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you touch it, the fruit's not
actually there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not physiologically ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in order to test this properly,
we need immortal populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I need to be able to plant this
out in an inoculated and un-inoculated
[SPEAKER_02]: trial and look for differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my limited understanding of that is
that it does not frequently, if at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce sexually in the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't answer your question about
lineages necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two species of this,
Alternaria tomatophila and Alternaria
[SPEAKER_00]: salani.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years ago, they were the same species,
but they've now been separated based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, somewhat host specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas salani is primarily a potato host
and tomatophila is primarily a tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I guess we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Grant, for that presentation as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to let you know, guys,
yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
