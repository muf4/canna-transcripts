[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jenny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you all for joining us in this
webinar on this rather chilly January day.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see from the bios that didn't
get read, Bora and I have been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental education for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bora, this isn't on presenter mode
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's what I was worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're both going to be sharing back and
forth in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this isn't a typical one where one
person talks and then you figure out your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and then the next person talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to be going back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'd love for you to do as we get
started is to use the chat to tell us what
[SPEAKER_01]: state you're coming from and what your
program area is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work in Extension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know that there's a huge range of
programs out there from livestock and
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture to, oh, I don't know,
energy and community development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's see who all is represented out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may tell us how to work some
examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got some forage folks and
financial education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep on doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we mentioned, the title of this is
Civic Engagement for Climate Action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're really talking about is
this document, there we go, that is part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Guidelines for Excellence series.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bora is going to give you some background
on that series so you know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she will take it away from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Martha mentioned, we just want to
spend a little bit of time telling you
[SPEAKER_02]: about the NWE Guidelines for Excellence
program that this publication is
[SPEAKER_02]: published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is part of, before we jump into a
more detailed discussion of what you will
[SPEAKER_02]: find when you go in and explore the
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should mention, this is important,
that the Guidelines for Excellence is an
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative of the North American
Association for Environmental Education,
[SPEAKER_02]: or NAAEE.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage you to investigate NAAEE.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great, great organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had amazing luck to be part of the
EE360 Plus partnership and also to receive
[SPEAKER_02]: funding from the USEPA Office of
Environmental Education for this project
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much throughout its whole history.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've also had amazing other partners
over the years who help us to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: these guidelines and to help us
disseminate them widely.
[SPEAKER_02]: to folks out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the series, there are seven
publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to give you a little bit of a
thumbnail for each one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is basically K-12 learner
expectations that lead to environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: literacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're equivalent to our national
standards, like NGSS or the C-3 social
[SPEAKER_02]: studies standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the common core, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're benchmarked at fourth grade,
eighth grade, and 12th grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they help map out how you might help
learners get towards environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: literacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And environmental literacy is core for
environmental education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also developed a set of guidelines
that's really all about what makes good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality instructional materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of those activity guides out there
that we give to educators of various ELCs
[SPEAKER_02]: to help them do activities, lessons with
their learners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this set of guidelines helps people
think about what are good quality
[SPEAKER_02]: instructional materials for the developer
to use, but also for the user to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to say, well, should I adopt these
materials or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a set of guidelines that's
really important for environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: educator competencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is it that we need to know and be
able to do to be good environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: educators?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's guidelines to help with program
development process from needs assessment
[SPEAKER_02]: to program design and implementation to
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guidelines for early childhood
environmental education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a set of guidelines that looks at how
do we go from taking our programs to the
[SPEAKER_02]: community and how do we actually work
collaboratively with communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, our newest set of
guidelines, which are the ones that focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on climate action and justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get into those more deeply in
just a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to give you a bit of background
about how these guidelines are developed,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's kind of important to what we
do and why we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the guidelines are rooted in
research and practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first activity, once we've
identified a general topic, is we search
[SPEAKER_02]: the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look at practice to try to identify
sort of what the big issues are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We form a writing team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that writing team has a draft
ready to share, we use a broad-based
[SPEAKER_02]: critique and consensus process where we've
literally involved thousands and thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: of individuals and organizations to shape
this suite of sets of guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: As important, however, to development of
these sets of guidelines is that we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that by involving professionals,
we're encouraging real discussions about
[SPEAKER_02]: the theory and practice of environmental
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: These discussions often have gone way
beyond the top topic of the set of
[SPEAKER_02]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, the educators had a chance
to reflect on what it means to be an
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental educator and what we're
trying to accomplish and how we're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, we kind of believe that this
set of guidelines or having guidelines in
[SPEAKER_02]: general that are based on this critique
and consensus collective wisdom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: field that we're collecting and
documenting effective practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first step in building a
strong professional identity and a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: profession of environmental education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to hand that over to Martha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that brings us to our latest
guideline, which is this one, educating
[SPEAKER_01]: for climate action and justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started this whole development process,
just like Bora said, by doing the research
[SPEAKER_01]: and interviewing about 20 folks across the
field from a variety of organizations and
[SPEAKER_01]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to know what they thought about
this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think initially the topic was
climate change and what makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also asked them for their
recommendations of what could be included
[SPEAKER_01]: in the guidelines and who else we should
contact, particularly thinking about that
[SPEAKER_01]: writing team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that work led to the development of a
really fantastic writing team made up of
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all brought different expertise in
climate justice, climate education,
[SPEAKER_01]: climate change, youth engagement,
a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They met several times online and several
times in person over the course of about
[SPEAKER_01]: two years to develop the guidelines,
respond to the comments that came in and
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep thinking and mulling and working
out what these things should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also formed an advisory group that
provided additional insight and helped
[SPEAKER_01]: steer us into a direction that would be
useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the whole process, we involved
at least 800 individuals and organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: in providing information, reviewing
drafts, giving feedback, and loads and
[SPEAKER_01]: loads of comments, not all of which were
opposite, but some of them were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our product, after all this,
is a set of guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are really suggestions for
program development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought we'd start in the beginning
by asking you to go back to that chat and
[SPEAKER_01]: think about what it is that you try to
remember when you start to design and then
[SPEAKER_01]: implement a climate program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of what we do as extent tension
educators is the same for any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of that generic stuff is relevant
to climate, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there anything specific that might
be unique to climate that you would keep
[SPEAKER_01]: in your mind as you try to develop a
climate program?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll wait a minute for you to do some
typing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Roz, right out of the box with
icebreakers, because you got to get people
[SPEAKER_01]: engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope is essential, and that draws
attention to emotions in the affective
[SPEAKER_01]: domain, which might be important to think
about with climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: David suggests we think about who is the
audience and what do they care about,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's got to be relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that relates to what Jenny says about
community members and their experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interpretation principles are helpful,
not just education and hands-on
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that might be age specific,
but how we engage people is certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: always relevant, meeting them where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, all this is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think is that you all know an
awful lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're climate educators here
doing this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't want to say, oh,
we know more than you do because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some ways, the guidelines are going
to duplicate and reinforce what you
[SPEAKER_01]: already know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping that there could be a few
things in the guidelines that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: currently doing that might provide you
some ideas about how you might extend what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing and maybe think about
something new and different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are ways that might enhance what
you're already doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about the way NAAE puts
together these documents is that they also
[SPEAKER_01]: include references that you can use to
justify your programs, examples and case
[SPEAKER_01]: studies of other things that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to convince somebody to
work with you, you can say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: here, here's where they've already done
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guidelines have a lot of resources
that you can use, even though you're
[SPEAKER_01]: already doing climate education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bora is going to tell us more about
what's in this document.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the very beginning of our effort
to develop this set of guidelines,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had a really big, broad guiding notion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to provide recommendations and
resources that support using education as
[SPEAKER_02]: a tool for addressing climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was our starting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also went really broad when we thought
about who the educators might be,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were hopefully going to speak to
with the set of guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought of in terms of teachers,
extension agents, museum staff,
[SPEAKER_02]: librarians, weather broadcaster,
faith educators, youth educators,
[SPEAKER_02]: all sorts of different people within
formal and non-formal and informal
[SPEAKER_02]: education programs, working with
everything from the very youngest all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way through adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have somebody on our writing team who's
an early childhood educator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though a lot of environment,
a lot of climate education doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: apply to that three-year-old, we were
still always mindful of like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: how might we start the process within that
early childhood age?
[SPEAKER_02]: We also began the process as a writing
team, focusing on sort of what we saw as
[SPEAKER_02]: four foundational pillars that would guide
all of our work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first was, frankly, a recognition
that there is a climate crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that probably surprises many
of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Earth systems and human systems
are intertwined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was just that we put it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, that's where we're starting from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also know the importance of
addressing solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, people become hopeless and
depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that there are things
communities and industries and individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: are currently doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that there's much more that people can
be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the very beginning, we decided that
given the urgency of climate change,
[SPEAKER_02]: these guidelines needed to focus not just
on climate change or reflect current
[SPEAKER_02]: climate science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those things are incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that we also wanted to focus on these
climate solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to explicitly avoid a message
that was heavy on gloom and doom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that people sort of had that
hope within them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That notion that there were solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third pillar really focuses on climate
action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, again, quite purposeful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guidelines could focus, again,
on education about climate science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how to do that really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to engage people in learning about
climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the team, following the research
literature, decided that we wanted to be
[SPEAKER_02]: more specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted the guidelines to focus on
educational efforts that foster climate
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes identifying a process to
learn about and select an action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And building the skills that will be
necessary to take that action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, our fourth pillar is that we
knew that any effective climate change
[SPEAKER_02]: education effort needed to address climate
justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as much as it needed to address any
of the other pillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the guidelines introduction,
we make the argument that effective
[SPEAKER_02]: climate education requires an
understanding and a centering on climate
[SPEAKER_02]: justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as a willingness to work towards
solutions that address the impact of
[SPEAKER_02]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to get to climate justice,
you need climate action, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that action needs to be developed
through a process and lead to an outcome
[SPEAKER_02]: that promotes climate justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw all of these four pillars really
interacting, intertwining with one another
[SPEAKER_02]: and supporting one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on those pillars and that sort of
thinking through what was important and
[SPEAKER_02]: why were we doing this work and what type
of set of guidelines did we actually want
[SPEAKER_02]: to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created what we call key
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we created five key characteristics
that basically outline a framework for
[SPEAKER_02]: effective education, climate action,
and justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many different ways that we
could have diced and sliced those four
[SPEAKER_02]: pillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always have many more key
characteristics or fewer key
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cross-cutting of them is always a
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we decided that over the two years and
hearing the feedback from people of what
[SPEAKER_02]: seemed to make sense and resonate with
folks out in the field, we ended up with
[SPEAKER_02]: these five big key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you will notice
right off is that there is not a general
[SPEAKER_02]: climate justice key characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an early draft, our first draft,
climate justice was a key characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seemed artificial to the writing
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed as if it was pulling it kind of
off to the side when we really felt that
[SPEAKER_02]: it was something that needed to be infused
throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got into that awkward bit of having
it pulled off to the side and bringing it
[SPEAKER_02]: up in other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the feedback that we got from people
is that they saw it as being awkward also
[SPEAKER_02]: and artificial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the end, climate justice is infused
throughout the guidelines and highlighted
[SPEAKER_02]: in each and every key characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each and every phase or step that we
outline in the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first key characteristic,
we started with one that suggests how
[SPEAKER_02]: educators should approach climate
education by creating a collaborative,
[SPEAKER_02]: welcoming, and responsive learning
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, we think that with all of
environmental education, whether you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking kids out for a one-day walk in the
woods or you're doing an ongoing
[SPEAKER_02]: community-based program down at the
library or working with fifth graders
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the year, it's important to
ensure inclusive learning environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engaging learners in open inquiry and
working with learners to explore world
[SPEAKER_02]: views and perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also felt that it was particularly
important, probably because it's climate
[SPEAKER_02]: and because it's controversial,
that the learners and the educators
[SPEAKER_02]: examine climate change information and
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we wanted to
sort of say, which may be kind of duh,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that this first key characteristic
describes effective education,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you're focusing on climate or
biodiversity or solid waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we felt that it was important to
articulate it and lay it out with sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: a focus on climate education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second key characteristic focuses
on knowledge and skills that foster
[SPEAKER_02]: climate action and justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we're taking that lens of that
everything is about fostering climate
[SPEAKER_02]: action and fostering climate justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what are the basic knowledge and those
skills that we'll need in order to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of work?
[SPEAKER_02]: This key characteristic puts an emphasis
on understanding earth systems and human
[SPEAKER_02]: systems and developing systems thinking
skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also focuses on the development of the
action strategies and skills and the
[SPEAKER_02]: building of personal and civic
responsibility that you need in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: foster climate action and justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we were developing our guidelines,
we knew that the federal agencies were
[SPEAKER_02]: revising their climate literacy guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of didn't bother to go into the
types of depth that they talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: because they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also kind of handy dandy because
Frank Niepold, who was one of the leaders
[SPEAKER_02]: of that process of developing the climate
literacy essential principles for
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding and addressing climate
change, he was on our writing team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were able to sort of give some
feedback back and forth and recognize that
[SPEAKER_02]: we were really sort of pretty much on the
same page as we moved along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically think that every climate
education model or set of guidelines
[SPEAKER_02]: typically includes some sort of foundation
of climate science knowledge and may get
[SPEAKER_02]: into a bit of the skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're recommending that if you haven't
already looked at them because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty new, they were launched in the
fall, is that you take a look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: climate literacy essential principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a great companion piece to our
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Martha sort of mentioned,
they're a resource that can give you some
[SPEAKER_02]: background.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could give you an entree into certain
groups of people to basically say,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only do I think that this sort of work
is important, but here's work that has
[SPEAKER_02]: been done by all of these federal
agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intersection between our guidelines
and the essential principles are sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty obvious once you start to play with
them, is that in addition to placing an
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasis on the science behind climate
change and that knowledge that you need,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is their essential principle number
two, they talk about the impacts,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is principle number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: They talk about mitigation, principle
number seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also call out equity, which is
principle number five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say basically that climate
justice is possible if climate actions are
[SPEAKER_02]: equitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they call out hope and emergency,
which is number eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: A livable and sustainable future for all
is possible with rapid, just, and
[SPEAKER_02]: transformational, yeah, okay, that word,
climate action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really see this as being a great
complimentary piece to our guide,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we certainly hope that they see our
set of guidelines as complimentary for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Key characteristic three calls attention
to the importance of climate emotions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously don't want learners to
increase their level of worry or their
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns or their anxiousness or their
grief.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to recognize that people are
doing things and that things are possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, as educators, need to recognize and
acknowledge that climate emotions are
[SPEAKER_02]: real, that we have them, that our learners
have them, and that they really need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: addressed one way or the other in our
programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also call out the need to cultivate
constructive hope and to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: self-efficacy and agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: With constructive hope, it's a concept
that is based on research evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what it tells us is that
hope needs to go beyond wishful thinking,
[SPEAKER_02]: that wishful thinking is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly hope it doesn't rain tomorrow,
because I really want to go for that hike
[SPEAKER_02]: out on the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wishful thinking, we do it all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order for things to, hopefully,
hope really matter, we need learners to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop constructive hope, where they
actively engage with shaping the future
[SPEAKER_02]: with a plan to achieve a goal,
where they're actively engaged in taking
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that notion of constructive hope is
really key to this idea that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: have attention on climate emotions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll turn it over to Martha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bora has just gone through the first
three key characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do the last two, number four,
number five, with some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just where we are in the
roadmap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are at number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent climate change education is
locally focused and community driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, by community, we could mean either a
geographic community, like a town or a
[SPEAKER_01]: city or a neighborhood, or a functional
community, like a school or a workplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one works as a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want good education to be relevant
to that community, those community
[SPEAKER_01]: members, which means the educator is going
to be making a bridge between the learner
[SPEAKER_01]: and the communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having that community engaged could
also mean that the educator now has more
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise available to them, filling in
some gaps, perhaps, in climate science or
[SPEAKER_01]: climate justice or climate action,
whatever they need, and more people are
[SPEAKER_01]: engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also means that if the learners are
going to be doing a community project as
[SPEAKER_01]: their action, there's a local place for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just easier to see success when
you're working locally than when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to work at the national or
international level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about developing skills
that move in this direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of useful tools that
might help you as educators think about
[SPEAKER_01]: the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is EJScreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jenny already put the website in the chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the screen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Environmental Justice Screening and
Mapping Tool is developed by the US EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in case you're not familiar with it
yet, we'll just give you an introduction
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I might want to say,
however, is go there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know how much longer this website
will be active.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't know these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's categories on the left that
you'll see when you get to the EJScreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can plug in the zip code or the
community name of where the community is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get these categories on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all different kinds of maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Environmental Justice Index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right there in the center is the list
of the justice indexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are actually a combination of both
the environmental burden index and the
[SPEAKER_01]: demographic index.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're already mushed together,
showing you the percentage of people by
[SPEAKER_01]: census blocks that are exposed to each of
these burdens, whichever one you've
[SPEAKER_01]: clicked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are maps for climate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see in the upper right corner
there, it's flood, wildfire, floodplain,
[SPEAKER_01]: sea level rise, and extreme heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is not an overlay between the
climate data and the demographic data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to do that by eyeball.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of flood risk in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, because you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, Pittsburgh has rivers
running through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next to the rivers is where there's a
flood risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also see that it's sort of
spotty as you go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take the demographic data from
the housing burden, which happens to be
[SPEAKER_01]: where people earn less than median income
and spend more than 30% of it on housing,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the census blocks of where that's
showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see there's some overlap
between housing burden and flood risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking to do a workshop,
for example, on climate issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to pick one of those places,
you might want to emphasize flooding as an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact of climate, because that could be
relevant to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can also look at other kinds of
maps and align those to climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grab any of the socioeconomic
indicators, which could suggest justice
[SPEAKER_01]: issues of some sort, people of color,
unemployment, limited English,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one happens to show low income along
with flood risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see who you're talking to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're talking to a community from
somewhere on the hills outside Pittsburgh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're interested in doing an
activity around justice, then they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to this website and figure out,
OK, here's a community that we could think
[SPEAKER_01]: about doing something with and then
organize how you communicate with that
[SPEAKER_01]: community and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the EJ screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fifth characteristic is civic
engagement for climate action.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds kind of similar to what we were
just talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went around mushing these together
and pulling them apart several times and
[SPEAKER_01]: decided that, no, first, people need to
learn about the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, people need to think about
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's many different kinds of
actions, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can clean up streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're saying, what is excellence in
environmental education and climate
[SPEAKER_01]: education?
[SPEAKER_01]: And excellence, we thought, we're
recommending, is moving towards civic
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement as the kind of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just doing something,
but it's learning about policy and power
[SPEAKER_01]: and who makes decisions and who influences
those decision makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the systems in my community
for making a change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that becomes the action,
working toward making a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it just may be asking for a
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it may be telling the newspaper,
we're going to make a statement,
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting the newspaper to help
encouraging people to make a change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all sorts of ways you can make
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're suggesting, think about civic
engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's empowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can see that they could be
making a change in policy for the long
[SPEAKER_01]: term, not just for the length of time this
particular maintenance person is willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep this particular garden in its
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm just checking to see that
I've said everything I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are several extension
programs around the country that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact same series and process of
learning information, making a difference
[SPEAKER_01]: in your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all the climate stewards
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably people from Cornell and
California and Oregon and Illinois on this
[SPEAKER_01]: webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yes, you've got programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The common denominator seems to be that
participants get information about climate
[SPEAKER_01]: and climate impacts, apply them to their
local area, work together to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what they can do to either increase
community resilience or reduce greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the one, two, three,
four, five across the middle there are the
[SPEAKER_01]: objectives from the Cornell program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've done is to add the arrows on
the bottom that suggests the key
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics in the NAAE guidelines
that relate to those four objectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Bora suggests, Bora said that
guideline number one has to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: welcoming atmosphere and engaging people
and doing a good job of running a program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got number one spread out through
one, two, and three of the objectives,
[SPEAKER_01]: because whenever the educator is leading
the group, that's how they're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowledge and skills and characteristic
two seem like they're really presented in
[SPEAKER_01]: objective two because you're developing
the confidence and skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: The success stories and examples that
build hope, which is our characteristic
[SPEAKER_01]: three, seem to be embedded in objective
number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they create their own activity,
it comes up in objective number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the local community is engaged in
number three and number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our characteristic four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the action is the activity
that they do in objective four,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's characteristic five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a close correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guidelines are nothing dramatically
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just thinking that it's a resource
that's out there that might be useful to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another example is that we believe youth
also can follow these guidelines and do
[SPEAKER_01]: climate action and justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CAPE program is community action
projects for the environment developed out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed for 4-H, but we've had
groups in museums and zoos and schools use
[SPEAKER_01]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this summer, we're going to pilot
this CAPE program with senior citizens to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically a process where the
group goes through brainstorming and
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring, developing and implementing an
action project, and then reflecting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The action in this case is that they
identify a decision-maker and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: request for a change that benefits
everybody related to whatever issue it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they've chosen to explore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny's going to put up another URL
for CAPE.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the end of our orientation to
the program itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to let you know that these
materials are available for free download
[SPEAKER_02]: from the NAA website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can click on the URL or I put the
URL in the chat and that you can also get
[SPEAKER_02]: to all of the sets of guidelines that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all available for free download up
on the NAA website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, we just wanted to point
out that NAA has developed a climate
[SPEAKER_02]: change education hub that you can find
information about education policy and
[SPEAKER_02]: research about effective climate change
education strategies, climate justice
[SPEAKER_02]: resources, and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please visit that NAA, go to the
climate change stuff, and you'll be in to
[SPEAKER_02]: do all sorts of great and wonderful
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we're going to stop sharing
and open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, of course, type your question in
the chat, but Jenny, can they also talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think folks can talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you'll have to type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Type away, type away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, while you're thinking about
your questions or comments, I put in
[SPEAKER_02]: Martha's email and my email into the chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you think of something,
you know, tomorrow when you're by cycling
[SPEAKER_02]: to work or skiing to work, depending on
where you live, you know, please feel free
[SPEAKER_02]: to email us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be so you showed the website,
the NAA website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to spend some time helping us
navigate that website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you feel comfortable or instructing
me on how to navigate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, while you talk, let me see if I can
find it easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're sitting here and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, while Boris is doing that,
I will just mention that NAAE does
[SPEAKER_01]: workshops around these guidelines and has
a trainer's bureau that is full of people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are capable and interested and
available to do those workshops in local
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension educators may be interested in
becoming a trainer for the climate
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines or for any other guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are, you need to talk to Bora
as she runs that program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each of these guidelines now has a
series of activities for presenters to use
[SPEAKER_01]: in workshops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are resources that are available
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To just feed off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we try to help people out as much as
we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're very willing to share what we
develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this, this PowerPoint, if you want it,
ask and we'll, we'll make sure you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, we're great trusting that people
will do the right things with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have just sort of scripts or
little short PowerPoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing that sort of dog and pony
show kind of thing up to an all day
[SPEAKER_02]: workshop that focuses just on this set of
guidelines or all day workshops that focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on any of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have those materials all set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the NAA website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just a ton of stuff on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a boring, rainy, snowy day
someday, go in and investigate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost all, well, in fact it is,
it's almost all free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost all accessible without,
you know, being a member.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sometimes have to sign up for like the
EE Pro stuff and have a, have a password,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't have to pay anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and then you have access to
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So under programs, you just, as just say,
I should do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say under programs, this is how
you could also get to the guidelines for
[SPEAKER_02]: excellence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're under programs, whoops,
whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're under the climate change education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so there's been a lot of
work being done on climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Climate policy, there's a call that is
done I think monthly of people looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: advocacy issues around climate education
and environmental education in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just all sorts of, there's this
coalition that puts things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can join it again for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: NAA is really great in terms of really
trying to make things accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: To everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it advertises different, you know,
surveys that have been done with
[SPEAKER_02]: educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've done a series of surveys of
administrators and classroom teachers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe the newest one is with
non-formal educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just a ton, a ton of stuff on
here, different resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Including policy, information about
policy, just basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it, climate literacy, you know,
getting into what's happening out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: linking to webinars that are being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing another, well, I'm doing
another webinar tomorrow that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: shortened version talking about this set
of guidelines, but also with Frank Niepolt
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the climate literacy
principles and some of the someone from
[SPEAKER_02]: MIT talking about some service learning
resources that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just, you know, a lot of stuff
out there and available to folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just takes some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know time to dig into it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, Bora.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to mention that the name
North American Association for
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental Education implies that it's
perhaps equally called Mexico,
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, U.S., but it isn't, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We welcome Mexicans, Canadians and U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: people to join, but it is primarily driven
by the United States membership and
[SPEAKER_01]: resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had conferences in Canada and
Mexico and the cost of translating to
[SPEAKER_01]: French and Spanish is really, really
challenging for small professional
[SPEAKER_01]: associations to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a question about how NAAE is
supported and funded and the demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I just started to do that,
didn't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Membership organization, members can join
and pay a small fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conference usually generates small
income to help support staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to say in Washington, D.C.,
but they actually work from home in a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get grants, big grants,
lots of grants, supports from NOAA for
[SPEAKER_01]: climate education, support from U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: EPA for training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the support that has
generated the guidelines for excellence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just lots of partnerships and lots of
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Board, do you want to say anything more
about support and funding and demographics
[SPEAKER_01]: while I think about Paul's question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, other than, you know, one of the
challenges that NAAE has is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like many small not-for-profits,
is that a lot of our funding comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: the federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's always precarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're right now in a precarious point.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're supposed to start our fifth year of
that EE360-plus grant that we have with
[SPEAKER_02]: EPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're supposed to start that June 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the papers haven't been signed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they normally aren't signed by this
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't know what the new
administration will do with EPA in
[SPEAKER_02]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're at a, hmm, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funding is a real issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do get funding from private
foundations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get funding from donors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get funding from basically whoever will
give us money to do the work we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of the attention,
I mean, Martha's spending a lot of her
[SPEAKER_02]: time now writing or helping the staff and
the executive director write proposals so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can keep doing the work that we
do, but getting the funding to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of you who write proposals,
you know that it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the demographics of the
membership, most are what I would put into
[SPEAKER_02]: the big bucket of non-formal educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of agency people, state agency
people, natural resources kinds of folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who sponsor things like Project
Learning Tree and Project Wet and Project
[SPEAKER_02]: Wild at the state level, university
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but again, most of our members are U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a program that we're the
secretariat of that's called Jeep,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the Global Environmental
Education Partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that brings in a lot of members from
other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a weird mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you can think about the next
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good old Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we all have challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension is driven by state politics as
much as it is driven by national politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And extension agents are sensitive to
politics, both at the state level and
[SPEAKER_01]: their community level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the letter grades range from
not doing very much at all in a livestock
[SPEAKER_01]: and range community where people think one
thing and to very high in urban
[SPEAKER_01]: communities where they're on a coast and
the sea level is rising and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about making adaptations to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida, I think the Sea Grant folks
are doing a phenomenal job of climate
[SPEAKER_01]: literacy in their coastal communities
because the communities want to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on and how they can protect
themselves and how can they be more
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient until we get to that point where
everybody in a community wants to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extension agents are going to have a
harder time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're we're currently investigating how it
is we talk about climate change when
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't want to hear those two words
close together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we need to do some research
on motivated reasoning and what are those
[SPEAKER_01]: buttons that we want to avoid getting
people upset about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these questions are good for
everybody, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should educators do their work without any
kind of politics or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make sure we're doing a good job
when education is political?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the one to answer these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody should think about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we working through DEI stuff
these days?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: My personal sense is that people will pick
these set of guidelines up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as Martha was saying,
the people in Florida respond to the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that they're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily if you're doing some
sort of workshop or you're doing some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of work or you're developing curriculum
materials or whatever, offering a program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, you're not going to give them
this set of guidelines unless you're
[SPEAKER_02]: training them in these guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it becomes part of the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the work becomes knowing your
group and knowing the language they use
[SPEAKER_02]: and knowing what are things that they're
going to see as being political or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were told while we were developing
these that in certain communities,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, no, we're not going to be able
to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you talk about resilience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about community resilience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about, well, we know that the
sea level is rising in certain places and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we talk about that and what to do
about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it becomes a bigger challenge
with the current administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I stand by our work and I stand by our
language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that as with most education,
you have to know your audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a question about my use of
non-formal educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an EE thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to like the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, we think of non-formal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put basically a flip between formal
educators are K-12 educators, maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And non-formal educators are zoo and
museum and nature centers and all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put extension agents as non-formal
educators in our sort of division of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-formal educators and what the science
community calls informal educators are
[SPEAKER_02]: really very much the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't get hung up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to answer Roz's question about
DEI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting this out there for you all to
think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my head, it makes sense to think about
climate justice work in three different
[SPEAKER_01]: categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is who are the learners?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm specifically targeting a Title
I school, then my audience is coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: a certain clientele that counts as
justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter who the audience is,
the second bucket is the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can teach about how climate change is
variable and the impacts are variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people get a bigger burden than
others and they already have a bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: burden in some ways socioeconomically than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's justice and injustice going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the second bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third one relates to that climate
action piece and helping people make
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter who it is that's making
change, the change shouldn't aggravate the
[SPEAKER_01]: injustice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want the change to work toward
creating more justice in any community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can think about doing DEI work
in any of those dimensions, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: and feel like you're helping to move the
world in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can call it whatever you need to
call it based on your administrator and
[SPEAKER_01]: your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have totally enjoyed this conversation
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Bora and Martha for
sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thoughtful and inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also say warm approach to
thinking about how we can all work
[SPEAKER_00]: together to build equitable futures for
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I just want to give a warm
thank you to Bora and Martha for sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to just add that I
recently saw a big sign that said,
[SPEAKER_00]: no justice, no peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was spelled K-N-O-W, K-N-O-W.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we know justice, we know peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a very constructive way
of thinking about, you know, in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: way, justice is a very profound word and
one that is at the forefront of our whole
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that justice, we can find
equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say thank you again for
a wonderful presentation and for folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: want to come to our other webinars for the
third Wednesday of the month at 2 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have the
registration links because the talks
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't finalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in February 19th, we'll be talking
about hopefully electrification of farm
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment with new NRCS standards in
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be talking about environmental
justice and solar, both for homeowners and
[SPEAKER_00]: also brownfields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in April, hopefully we'll be
talking about statewide policies for
[SPEAKER_00]: research and duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what other states are doing
or what your state is empowered to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to think about how to mobilize
behind those current policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining,
and I hope to see you next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
