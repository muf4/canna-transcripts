[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to be here and see some
old friends like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had been a conventional farmer for
years on the East Shore of Maryland,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then in 2005 we decided that we were
going to jump into the organic farming
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we have about a thousand acres
of farm organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, actually the first year that we did
start, we did start with some organic or
[SPEAKER_02]: transitional no-till sweet beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And except for a few years ago,
we planted some every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had some great success and we've had
some failures also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul has mentioned this year for a
band we planted about 150 acres of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till sweet beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up plowing up, I think,
not quite half off from the poor stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've run the gamut on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do plant a lot of conventional sweet
beans also.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our corn is conventional even though I
think one year we participated with Penn
[SPEAKER_02]: State and Rodeo for planting some no-till
corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't have much success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple years ago we planted 20
acres of no-till corn with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much success.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are, I guess, very interested in
the no-till or reduced aspect of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the issues that
organic farmers in general have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tilling the soil too much,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've heard this morning
that this is a huge tillage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's harder to do every morning at any
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we like about your
huge tillage is just my son-in-law and
[SPEAKER_02]: myself, and from a labor standpoint,
it is a great labor savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a time factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four or five farms we've tilled
within 15 miles of our own farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still a job to move the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And time is a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as most of you know, organic farming
time is crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're planting color-making,
whether you're sowing or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: planting your cover crop, time is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems, I'll just add to that point
quickly, Bill, is it seems like our
[SPEAKER_00]: windows for getting things done,
planting, management, almost any part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year, but especially the spring is
shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those windows are just getting smaller,
and you've got to get more done in less
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time, or the same amount done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In less amount of time, and you've got to
find, you've got to have options,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to have solutions, you've got
to have, as Matt put it, adaptive
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good, Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have thought about a few different
ideas ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like the window of
opportunity is smaller, and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with different ideas to approach
the problems that we have encountered.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I know Steve's got one
picture on, one thing we have found this
[SPEAKER_02]: year is strip tillage after barley.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time we've found that with
all the strip-till machines, thinking that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got issues getting a no-till,
so we've been thought to establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought rather than finding this
would perhaps be a halfway point where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just tilling up a strip and leaving
the rest of the residue there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I could skip around with the
presentation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to modify it for this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, on the itinerary there for our
talk, we're, I guess, focusing on no-till
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to definitely focus on
that, but maybe just go through a brief
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of our operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too far into the slides here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we're going to highlight and
we're going to overlap a lot conceptually
[SPEAKER_00]: with what Matt has already spoken about,
and Klaus also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably could have all four of us
stood up here for about an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: and did just ping pong back and forth off
of each other, and it would have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're going to touch on a lot of
those same subjects and experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just probably come at it from our
perspective down on the lower eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: shore of Maryland, or just the middle,
eastern shore of Maryland, where if they
[SPEAKER_00]: see things a little differently or we just
want to give you a kind of example of
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe where we've been, where we are now,
and hopefully where we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to move on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to interject to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve is a graduate of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: My daughter is also a graduate of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately for May, his family had a
discount farm about 45 minutes from here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he came down and they actually had
some here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he fit right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just we see there's plenty of challenges,
but with every challenge it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pests and the two-year rotation,
it seems like we lock into certain
[SPEAKER_00]: specific pest cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go over those sort of things
specifically when we're talking about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of our no-till soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predominantly weeds are our biggest pest,
our biggest concerns right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our later planting and increased
tillage in certain situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: in general we seem to have more aggressive
annual broadleaf weeds that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for different ways to try to
interrupt those pest cycles, those weed
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're trying to enter
into using less tillage, minimum tillage,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum disturbance, sometimes no-till,
sometimes different crops in the rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: to break up those cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's, for example,
peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peas that can be planted much earlier and
harvested at just different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will hopefully interrupt, like you
said, or disrupt those pest cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're going to be going
into soybeans.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the issues we've had in Maryland
the last three springs, it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely wet in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like we're facing the same
thing every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had great intentions of starting
planting corn the first of May,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, by the end of May we got our
beans planted, and it hasn't worked that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found, and we have a constant
battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get our crops in later, then our cover
crops go in later, and then the next
[SPEAKER_02]: spring they come off later, and it's just
a thing like, it's a never-ending cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got to plant shorter season corn
and harvest earlier, and we have rain
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that we can dry our grain,
but we still have issues with that
[SPEAKER_02]: respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, like I said before, it's all
about the timing, and I think getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crops in in the fall earlier is a
great asset, and it just seems like we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hard time meeting that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've, it just seems like we've
run the gamut of just about almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: type of situation that we can think of
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's got to be more out there
depending on the type of management,
[SPEAKER_00]: your type of rotation, and even the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, for our two-year rotation,
yes, it seems like we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just going back to, if we have to go back
to conventional tillage, we still see the
[SPEAKER_00]: same problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't seem to be, even if you can work
the field several times and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: diminish the weed seed bank, we still have
aggressive weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that, what we believe,
and I think, is we, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: you farm a certain way, a certain
rotation, you select for certain weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really anthropogenic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as farmers, you know,
you've planted certain dates, you do
[SPEAKER_00]: operations with cultivating, working the
ground certain dates, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: select certain weeds that fit into those
little gaps where you aren't working the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, where they're going to emerge,
and they can be much more aggressive than
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop corn or soybeans that you've
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about trying to find another
way to, to find a way around that or just
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way to at least get your crops far
enough ahead where you have other options
[SPEAKER_00]: or tools in your toolkit to address those
weed issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other challenges, bills touched on,
management and labor, cost of fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to grow, of course, our cover,
our nitrogen for our corn, availability
[SPEAKER_00]: for, and sources of our nutrients can
sometimes can be an issue if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to grow your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can only grow part of it for your
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a few of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we do on our farm,
our soybeans are aerial seeded with clover
[SPEAKER_02]: and either probably a week mixture,
about a third of a week in some time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we do that every year on our soybean
ground because we're usually rotating that
[SPEAKER_02]: in the corn the next spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're, we've had a pretty good success
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're growing, I think, anywhere from 60
to 80 pounds of nitrogen through the
[SPEAKER_02]: clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably working in the soil in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that provides us about half of our
total nitrogen needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're generally, all our soybean
ground that's clover, cereal grains next
[SPEAKER_02]: year are in corn ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not in barley for graining,
the rest of it will be planted dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will just be a quick summary of just
our rotation, our kind of a traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: two-year crop rotation from corn grain to
fall cover crop rye planted after the
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the soybeans, whether it's you
use the rye or not, we will be planting
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans following that rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decide to terminate it early or late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then following soybeans are,
as Bill just mentioned, cover crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: flown on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a mixture of crimson clover and
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really the reason is for
it's a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We participate in our state cover crop
program and they do require it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: legume to have a small grain mixed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can debate that if we want a little bit
later if it's really necessary or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of the operations
that we're looking at in between for
[SPEAKER_00]: managing, for cover crop management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between corn grain and fall rye,
establish a cover crop early is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will repeat that just like you've heard
probably a lot already in these earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in this room, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use aero, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saves a lot of time for us into the
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those soybeans that haven't been
cultivated establishes a little nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a little more bare soil,
a lot of more nooks and crannies for that
[SPEAKER_00]: small seed to fall into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you really need is a little bit of
precipitation and it seems to take right
[SPEAKER_00]: off in probably four out of five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had years where we've had poor
crops, but maybe a poor winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, it's usually a pretty sure
bet when it's flown on into a cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were able to do no-till
soybeans and you still have a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: rye cover on, we've had issues with
establishing that legume barley mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because that cover is still
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That rye is persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be, but it tends to get
spotty, uneven stands of our cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had to oversee that with an
airplane, and you just not get the soil to
[SPEAKER_02]: seed contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several years we've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been planning a plot where we've
come in with all-stream winter plays and
[SPEAKER_02]: drilled it in after we harvest the
soybeans, and that seems to work pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, in this picture here,
this slide here, it deals with
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing the cover crop or terminating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we obviously talked about establishing
and terminating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're rye, if you do want to use the
rye, if you have the biomass you think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can make it work, roll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you've got to destroy it early,
although that comes with its own
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably talk about that a little
bit as we move along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me check my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to proceed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our corn grain, if we're trying to
incorporate our corn grain, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: release that nitrogen, it's either been
plowing down or disking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plowing is slower, a lot more intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have an erosion issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a big rain event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disking, it's a little quicker,
although you might not get the field
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions you like for planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a lot of residue on the surface
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with a decent planter, you might have
some pest issues too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had issues with, for example,
cutworm in a field we thought it had a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the residue still in the
surface in some parts of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those pests like to lay their
eggs on the residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when you plant your crop,
that residue has only been incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your seed's about two inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there amongst those pests there
and waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw this in here just real quickly as
an alternative, something you could stick
[SPEAKER_00]: in to possibly break up the pest cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting there, instead of fall rye,
what we've done, we've put in fall barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big reason, it's profitable,
extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a good price for it, for organic
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to fertilize it, but what we've
used before, a company that we use that
[SPEAKER_00]: has some organic fertilizer, they've done
it for a lot of dairy farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put the seed, the red clover seed,
in with the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out the booms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sprays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed's small enough to have the right
nozzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can interseed when you're top
dressing in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You establish your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one less pass you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice option for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the case is where you want to summer
fallow, as long as the numbers work out on
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, if it's a farm you're not sure
about, or you just have your point in time
[SPEAKER_00]: in your season, or your management where
you've got a lot of other farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got acres, you're spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't want that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the numbers work out, you'll summer
fallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That red clover's come on real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to mow for weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to kind of be a stickler for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep the weeds down, mow high,
keep the clover growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then instead of your crimson clover
that was flown on, that will be flown in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall, you already have something
established, ready to go there next
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, and we've seen it produce quite a
bit of nitrogen for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can include that in a few other
slides here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, as I mentioned, peas,
we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a good money maker for us in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for breaking up those pest
cycles, early spring planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: early summer harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still maintain your row crop
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to plant soybeans after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pest and weed management, typically
when we fit the field, we usually have
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a flush of weeds, or if we can't
control the weeds as well as we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that they won't go to seed by the
time it's ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those weeds, it might be till
July before their seed heads are mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's being harvested in June,
along with the peas, when those harvesters
[SPEAKER_00]: come in, it's all taken off, and you maybe
have to diminish your weed seed bank
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tried spinach early fall sown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a whole lot of success with
this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company that wanted to try it out,
I just don't believe they had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of other things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of other conventional
spinach acres going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they quite had the right
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seemed to have a weed issue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to get one cutting off in
very late fall, or actually not early
[SPEAKER_00]: winter, December, I believe, they took it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of getting another cutting in
the spring, they just let it go,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we went straight right into corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peas and spinach, alternative income,
it can be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a pretty good money maker for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the numbers have to work
also, along with a lot of the other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're looking to, and the rotation,
and the whole farm management system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pest cycles, and that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tillage sowing dates and harvest all,
well, they can be a benefit for those
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go right through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the main point of this is,
like Foss mentioned, when you're farming
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, it's nice to have it being
more diversified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately for us, corn and
soybeans on a three-year cycle is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of our crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we could do better if we had
more crop alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it would help the soil,
their yields, and everything, but we just
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't figured that out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide here, Bill, if you want to talk
about it, is just kind of a quick and
[SPEAKER_00]: dirty breakdown of just the numbers when
you're doing either no-till soybean or
[SPEAKER_00]: conventionally tilled soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Steve, this is convenient here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see this behind us down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the gist of the whole slide is,
you know, if you're a farmer, like every
[SPEAKER_02]: other farmer, what we have found is that
the no-till soybeans cost us about $100
[SPEAKER_02]: less in expanses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you read 35 of those later,
I think over there, $100, your net
[SPEAKER_02]: income's about $100 to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one reason that we're trying
to make this no-till work is less time,
[SPEAKER_02]: less labor, and you can make a little bit
more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so those are basically the economics
when you put the pencil to the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of, you know,
a lot of what Matt's been talking about in
[SPEAKER_00]: class and a lot of other speakers have
been talking about are some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: figures you don't have a fine,
a good grasp on or a quantitative number
[SPEAKER_00]: just to put on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of the research
that's been done over the years and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the work between farmers and extension
and university and so on and NRCS,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, you know, we know that there's
benefits there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can quantify some of them in certain
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some we can't, but usually you can talk to
the farmer directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can probably tell you what works,
what doesn't, and where they see the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, where they can see room for
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know they're there, but this is
just to give you a quick overview of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at when we just try to put
numbers down on the page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the net income per acre for
no-till $280 per acre versus conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: $168, and that basically is due to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Field operations, the difference there,
really, you only have most of your cost in
[SPEAKER_00]: the conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till is you're plowing, you're dishing
all your field work, pulling out the
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor, pulling that equipment,
and your labor too, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: being somebody to do it, and how that
really adds up on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes down to your net,
and we can see where we come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most American no-till soybeans that we've
had in past years, we've had more grass
[SPEAKER_02]: issues than farm and wheat issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I'd like to mention is,
and I've told several people this,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you plant a no-till, you can save time
and labor, even if you grow a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: bushels less per acre, you still end up
with the same amount of income,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have a lot less time and effort
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick overview of our two main
cover crop families, the legumes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cereal grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, your legumes, you've got your
clovers, vetch, cowpea, field pea,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the sun hemp, although we're
using really the clover, red and or
[SPEAKER_00]: crimson, but kind of for two different
reasons in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal grains, rye, barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try some wheat this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't ever tried oats or triticale,
but that can be popular with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: systems like organic dairy for chopping,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, that forage rye seems to
have a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find somebody to sell to,
if they've got animals, you've got an
[SPEAKER_00]: operation if they need it, if it's a
drought year, like Klaus was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you got it out there, maybe you can
make something off it, and it'll all work
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nebraska's grasses, canola radishes,
grass, the Sedan grass, sort of Sedan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll let the worms see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye, main characteristics is an annual
high biomass potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, of course, wheat suppression,
and that's due to the lignous nature at
[SPEAKER_00]: boot stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crimson clover, an annual winter hardy,
most often, more often than not,
[SPEAKER_00]: very good nitrogen production,
fast growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it establishes pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've broadcast clover on the field and
then drilled over it with just our grain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it comes right up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because those press wheels are
using a seven and a half inch spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: drill, press wheels, it just incorporates
it just into the surface, and as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a little bit of moisture,
it takes off right with the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And barley, that's our other cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move down here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a picture of some clover and some
rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for biomass, wheat
suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass for our legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want as many nitrogen credits as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That picture did not help me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing we did try this year where we
planted on rolling soybeans on a 20-acre
[SPEAKER_02]: field home, we did plant clover in our rye
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spread it on the top of the field
before we drilled the rye in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Steve planted the soybeans,
we were rolling down the rye and the
[SPEAKER_02]: clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our wheat control is actually a
little bit better in that field.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, not really hardly any broadleaf
weeds with some grass pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we're anxious to combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also looking for maybe a way to
perhaps give us some little synergistic
[SPEAKER_00]: boost to the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we all know that legumes,
they fix nitrogen, and of course any crop
[SPEAKER_00]: with roots entangled below the ground with
it will try to feed off some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps we thought maybe if we've had
years where our biomass for a rye hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been quite where we want it, we said,
well, if at the very least it might give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a few pounds of nitrogen while it's
growing and add a little bit of biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might put us over the top where we can
go all in on a no-till situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we didn't think it gave a whole
lot of nitrogen to the rye, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we still have some biomass, although it's
a little more fleeting because we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that clover is a succulent crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give a little more biomass to the
whole system, and then if it rolled down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it still might provide enough time,
assuming everything else works out in your
[SPEAKER_00]: favor, for that crop to get up,
and then maybe your soybeans get ahead of
[SPEAKER_00]: your weeds, and then you have more beans
than weeds out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a quick picture of our rig for no-till,
and that was what we did this summer with
[SPEAKER_00]: about 150 acres of no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a pretty good rye crop,
and I wanted just to mention one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see over here, this is the
direction the field runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a big rectangle,
and that's just a turn row along a
[SPEAKER_00]: hedgerow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see our angle for planting
into the lands back and forth passes is at
[SPEAKER_00]: an angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, working with Rodale when Bill
first started with organic, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: you always try to roll at an angle that
you planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to overlap that row of rye
into the next, and so on, so it's covering
[SPEAKER_00]: between the rows where you drilled,
so you're not trying to leave any gaps at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if that's a good talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets a whole lot of talk,
but that's one way we can do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems to work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to overlap, doesn't seem to leave
any gaps, and provides some pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that rolling was working
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, that tractor was covered up in
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the right timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to change the filter covers many a
time because the tractor was getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biomass, 5,000, 6,000 pounds,
you can hope for 8,000, 9,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're in 5 to 6, you're pretty
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this was, I think, between 4,000
and 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still decided to give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did lay over nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess a few issues that we had with it,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field, it's all about maybe your last
operation, your previous season.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you've done before, it'll haunt you
later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The field maybe wasn't as smooth as it
needed to be since the rye was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: thick, and it can be tough for the drill
to puncture through that biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have gaps, you have little dips
and divots and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, the seed might just be dropped right
on the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the field wasn't smooth enough,
you didn't have that contact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: drill to open that slot to drop the
soybean in, and then it just left it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some fields it seemed to do better than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure why exactly, but that was a
little bit of our experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, should we just open for a few
questions, or does anybody have any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have probably asked that 5,
10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the rye, actually we have,
I'm going to skip right to it right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually tried a little bout of no-till
corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put some leaves, clover, and rye in,
and had a nice stand of... Here's a
[SPEAKER_02]: picture of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we ended up growing about 50
bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually did not apply any other
nutrients other than we side dressed with
[SPEAKER_02]: about 50 pounds of organic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a beautiful stand of corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: We planted it at 30,000, and our
fertilizer company came down checking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we had 29,000 plants, but I don't
think they had enough nutrients on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one reason for that, it's still all
speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't take any samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a busy year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just trying something to see what
would happen, and see if there was some
[SPEAKER_00]: merit to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still think there is, but we think
since basically going from a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: tilled system directly into a no-till,
I think there's some issues with your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology and soil microbiology that just
switching gears immediately, even with a
[SPEAKER_00]: good cover crop, a lot of biomass,
that's the picture on the right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good biomass with the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like there was a fair amount of
pea and a lot of clover mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of that material stays on
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just don't have the soil structure
and things working for you underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, I think, with a long-term minimum
till or no-till situation, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that capacity to keep that crop growing I
think we just ran out of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just ran out of some fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would guess your CN ratio was a little
too narrow and it was tying up and early
[SPEAKER_01]: because your corn yield is determined so
early with these new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tolerate that early depression,
even if you had plenty of them the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes some mixtures for just
this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where he tries to limit the grass and get
the CN ratio narrower as a way to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure the corn has enough nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that Steve Mursky has been
working on a rye-vech mixture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios, the planting ratios and seeing how
it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding that sweet spot where it gives you
some lasting coverage for wheat
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression but gives you the nitrogen
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to find that Goldilocks scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's throwing in Hungarian Vetch and
crimson clover in the crimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get the CN ratio narrower, but he's
trying to reduce the amount of grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yes, you try to minimize that as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe two more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any slugs with the soybeans on that mulch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they like that mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're allowed to use slug bait in an
organic system if that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to pick your brain about that,
Claude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not had slug issues in the organic
stuff that I've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have damsels, but we have ground
eels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slugs have a state of conventional no-fill
system in our neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, there's all new tillage that
happens with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: That wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
