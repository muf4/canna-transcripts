[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much Tim and thank you for
the invitation to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be here and I've met some
really fascinating people this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: including the parking warden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to talk about is plant
phenotyping but first I thought I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want this to be the departmental seminar
commercial break but I will talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: genesis of the company Qubit Systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acronym Qubit for Queen's
University Biological Instrumentation and
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology and the founder members are
myself, that's me when I had more hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Dowling was working in the lab with
me and the lab was run by David Laisel who
[SPEAKER_00]: as Tim just alluded to we were doing a lot
of work with nitrogen fixation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen diffusion barrier in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-invasive measurements of nitrogenase
activity and the company was we were
[SPEAKER_00]: helped to start up by Partec Innovations
which is the Queen's University
[SPEAKER_00]: technological transfer arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing that we developed as part
of our research into plant physiology was
[SPEAKER_00]: a differential oxygen analyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the plant world measuring
photosynthesis and respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: small tissues, it's difficult to get
measurements of metabolic rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic rate using oxygen as the
measure of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we measure typically
photosynthetic uptake as CO2 uptake rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than oxygen release.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this is that the atmosphere
is about 350 part per million CO2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: rising and typically you put a leaf in a
leaf chamber, you measure the input CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: the output CO2, measure the difference
between the input out to output,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiply by flow rate and that gives you a
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you look at an uptake of about
10 parts per million against a background
[SPEAKER_00]: of 350 part per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to measure with an IR CO2
analyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxygen, much, much more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background is 210,000 part per million
but you still only exchange in 10 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring 10 ppm against 210,000,
very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we developed this instrument which
resolves 1 ppm oxygen against air and
[SPEAKER_00]: people were quite excited by it so Partex
had patented, let's form a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where essentially Qubit came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: The instrument is very, very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here measurements of oxygen
and CO2 looking at the respiration rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: a potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now not very exciting thing to do
measuring potato respiration rate but what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does illustrate is how stable the
signals are and that the respiratory
[SPEAKER_00]: quotient of your potato is one,
it's metabolizing pure carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: More interesting though is to use this
device to look at flux of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our potato, if we are metabolizing pure
carbohydrate and all the electrons going
[SPEAKER_00]: through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle end
up in the electron transport chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: we form water, we get one CO2 produced for
every oxygen consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a respiratory quotient of
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if these electrons are going somewhere
else, if they're being dragged off to
[SPEAKER_00]: other sinks, then that respiratory
quotient changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can look at the fate of
electrons if we measure oxygen and CO2 at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly with photosynthesis,
if the light reactions, if all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons generated in the light reactions
end up reducing carbon dioxide to
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrate, we get one oxygen produced
for every CO2 that is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if these reactions are pulled off
to do other things like nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilation in the leaf and what have
you, the ratio changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by measuring oxygen and CO2 at the same
time, we have a synergistic measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis in which we can look in
changing conditions perhaps at where the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrons are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually developed an acronym which was
flux of reductivity to alternative sources
[SPEAKER_00]: and sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we discovered that the acronym spelt
FRAS and at the time we didn't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that FRAS was actually caterpillar shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore we dropped that one and we
started to call it DRUR, which is Diverted
[SPEAKER_00]: Reductant Utilization Rate, which nobody
uses anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did some interesting measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I'd pull this one up,
it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to determine whether or not
the reductant generated in the light in
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean pods was actually used for fatty
acid metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at oxygen exchange rate in
the dark and CO2 exchange rate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a net flux of CO2 out of the
nodules in the dark and a net uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we turned the light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fixation of CO2 was not enough to
create a net uptake of CO2, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic reactions were enough to
have a net production of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, in this circumstance,
we had a tissue which is producing both
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and CO2 at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both being evolved and as far as
we know, that's the first time anybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: ever measured net flux of oxygen and CO2
in the same direction at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go into the details of the
paper, but we did discover that yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the reductant generated by the light
reactions of photosynthesis is involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty acid synthesis in the nodule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing we used the differential
oxygen analyzer for was a work with Steve
[SPEAKER_00]: Long at the University of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was interested in the question,
does elevated CO2 concentration decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: dark respiration in soybean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been a matter of contention
for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If high CO2, and this is the case with
global warming, it's gonna be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it affects dark respiration,
then you have to put this into your
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some question of if it does,
how does it do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some measurements with a
Lycor CO2 analyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, at high CO2 levels, there was a
reduction in dark respiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we measured this respiration
rate using oxygen uptake instead?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came to the conclusion,
and as of others since then, that these
[SPEAKER_00]: small changes actually in the respiration
resolution and the linearity of these CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: analyzers at high CO2 have been creating
an erroneous measurement of dark
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in fact, we came to the conclusion that
dark respiration is not affected,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least at the levels of CO2 that we
investigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought the world would be beaten our
door, beaten path to our doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here should be now very excited
about buying one of these differential
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen analyzers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there was a less enthusiastic
response, at least from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animal scientists love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was teaching bio 101,
I had 1,000 students in my 101 classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tony would know he wasn't one of them,
else he wouldn't be here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem was that the kids were
given, well, they weren't given Lycors and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They surrounded the one Lycor in the
department and told not to touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a black box with spat-out numbers
when they're measuring photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, it's lousy for teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, there's got to be a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to be a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed some very low-cost
instruments for measuring carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be deployed in the lab really,
really inexpensively using inexpensive
[SPEAKER_00]: software we got from a company in
Portland, Oregon, which I'll get to in a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've developed this over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call the cube box concept,
where we have a pump, a flow meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: a CO2 analyzer, an analyzer for measuring
relative humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all modular, but they all fit into
the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're inexpensive enough so that
teaching labs can afford these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anything ever goes wrong with any
of the components, one of the great things
[SPEAKER_00]: is you just phone as we send you a
replacement component, and these things
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of slot out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in, and you're ready to go
again within 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike the single units from LICO,
where $40,000 or $1,000, if the pump goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to send the whole thing back.
[SPEAKER_00]: LICO are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not denigrating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wonderful instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think these are wonderful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used now extensively in both
research and teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fantastic company called Vernier
Software in Portland, Oregon, which
[SPEAKER_00]: develops the interface and the software
for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get up to eight analog inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manipulation, the data manipulation,
the software is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful graphical displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a light response of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the changes in the actinic
light, the corresponding changes in CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes in stomatal movement measured
as relative humidity, and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: different pages within the software,
we calculate things like stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance, internal CO2, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really nice instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of commercial break.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to talk about for the bulk of
this presentation is plant phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, Qubit Systems has formed a very,
very close association with a company in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Czech Republic called Photon Systems
Instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company were the first company to
commercialize an imaging system for
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics,
and I will talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics,
a bit more detail about that later on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now then, why is there being this
apparently sudden massive interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant phenotyping systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: The big ag biotech companies are all
looking to get these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are establishments throughout the
world that are really, really keen on high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trait discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a kind of depressing slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next several slides, these are
taken from a talk given by Eric Murchie at
[SPEAKER_00]: a workshop I was at in Thailand two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was kind enough to send me these slides
yesterday, so I've stuck them in my talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I give him full credit for them,
although the work done is by other people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are credited here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was making the point that we are in
an extremely difficult situation with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to feeding the world in 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the increase in yield of various
crops from 1961 to 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this linear increase here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the yield requirement,
these dotted lines of each of these crops
[SPEAKER_00]: based on population in the year 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is the projected increase in
yield if we continue along these lines
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've been going on so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of this is that the land area
we would need to extend for each of these
[SPEAKER_00]: crops to get the yield that we require is
quite enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be a significant
problem about feeding people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you a great deal about this
slide, except that it's very depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't read, I must have read,
I must admit this paper, I didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but the take-home message from it is
that without adaptation to climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly to increase in temperature,
the yields that we're looking at right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, the yields that have been increasing
are actually going to decline 17 to 15%
[SPEAKER_00]: over this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very significant problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the news is not all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is, again, this is a paper
by Zhou, 2008, but if you look at solar
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, what comes in, what is potentially
there for the plant to use, if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the total amount of solar energy,
you get 1,000, say, kilojoules of energy
[SPEAKER_00]: not absorbed by the chlorophyll 513,
reflected or transmitted 49.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inefficiencies within photochemistry is
about 66, which leaves us with about 372
[SPEAKER_00]: kilojoules of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have C3 plants and C4 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 plants use more in carbohydrate
synthesis than the C3 plants, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: result, we've got 85 left compared to 128.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the C4 plants don't follow
respire, whereas the C3 plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the C4 plants are ahead with 85,
and then we have respiratory processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which bring the total energy to 60
kilojoules for the C4s and 46 kilojoules
for the C3 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the potential energy that could be
captured, turned into biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, only 1 to 2% of this is
realized, which means that we have scope
[SPEAKER_00]: for increasing this energy conversion and
capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to be looking at the various
traits of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is causing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they so inefficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can we put in some amelioration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the reasons, there's poor
absorption of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fora protection mechanisms,
which kind of get rid of the light energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which may be absorbed to protect the
thylakoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomatal closure of plants will light
saturate when perhaps we could change them
[SPEAKER_00]: so that light saturation point would be
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all issues to do with source and
sink relationship, feedback against
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, starches cumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things can reduce the
potential gain of energy by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of targets that we can aim
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the light response for
photosynthesis, we can see that here we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the light limited range, then we're in
the light saturated range.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could perhaps push this up higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have problems with excess
light energy where we get photoinhibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added to this, if the plants are stressed
with abiotic stresses or biotic stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: where the high light, low high
temperature, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: low water availability, pathogen
infection, it pushes the whole thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to find out what these traits
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be able to screen lots of
plants and to pick out the traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do this, qubit systems,
photon systems in the Czech Republic,
[SPEAKER_00]: some other companies I won't mention,
have designed and developed
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumentation for screening large
amounts of, large numbers of genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: modified plants, different lines,
and to be able to detect as rapidly as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible those plants with potentially
beneficial traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for high throughput
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ideally you'd want to measure
thousands of plants all at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd want to measurement
photosynthesis, transpiration,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that with conventional CO2
analyzers, oxygen analyzers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need proxies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these proxies are optical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'd like to talk about now
in the bulk of the seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have developed a series of
phenotyping instruments which we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have, they're different designs,
but they have similar components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this particular system, it's a
conveyor based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an external conveyor belt which
feeds plants into a cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cabinet is light acclimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has LEDs above.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's automatic watering and weighing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants go in trays or pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're light adapted or dark adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be watered and weighed to,
with specific protocols for drought or
[SPEAKER_00]: water sufficiency, even water logging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at the effect of any
treatments we do via thermal imaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral imaging, chlorophyll
fluorescence imaging, and all for
[SPEAKER_00]: morphometric and color analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bother with the numbers of these
things now installed throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in various sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has been developed for Pioneer
for screening very, very tall maize
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the University of Olomouc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different, pictured the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a close up of the system at the
University of Olomouc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this works, which I hope it will,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will show us a video, speed it up,
of the plants coming from the external
[SPEAKER_00]: conveyor into the cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going about four or five times
faster than the plants would normally
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They move through the conveyor system to
the imaging stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for measuring RGB and chlorophyll
fluorescence kinetics, which I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about more about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's thermal imaging and
there's hyperspectral imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is controlled under very strict
environmental conditions so that the light
[SPEAKER_00]: incident on the plants is homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is automatic weighing of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these plants here, you'll see the
plants lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on load cells here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five of the plants are weighed at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's automatic watering of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can program the amount of water
delivered to each plant so that the weight
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't change with time, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can reduce the weight so that you
get a drought-stressed environment or a
[SPEAKER_00]: waterlogged environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have students working with us doing
masters and PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole system runs off a graphical user
interface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can put in protocols for the
various imaging systems and data
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also do all of your viewing of
the data on these screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have systems in which the imaging
is taken to the plants rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants being taken to the imaging
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people argue that if you've got a
plant on a conveyor bouncing around,
[SPEAKER_00]: then over time you're going to get some
environmental effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some effects of vibration, which are going
to skew your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you can actually take the
imaging system to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would argue that a plant being
outside of the field environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: not moving at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's going to be skewing of its
architecture based on the fact that it
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't being buffeted by the winds,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do offer these options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we build these things in controlled
environment rooms, which we call
[SPEAKER_00]: phytoscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These have LED lighting above.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have large heat exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They control the environment very,
very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have field phenotyping systems of
different sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gantry system in which the
phenotype in the imaging array is built on
[SPEAKER_00]: a gantry, almost like an irrigation
platform, which moves across the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can move up and down for different
heights of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can do hyperspectral thermal
chlorophyll fluorescence RGB imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also got sensors for CO2,
light, wind, temperature, ambient sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it advances, scans across a transect,
advances again, scans again, generating
[SPEAKER_00]: terabytes of data in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a much more modest system in which
the user can just drive the system or push
[SPEAKER_00]: the system in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The imaging system is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It moves up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a smaller version of this in which
the imaging array moves across a small
[SPEAKER_00]: transect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the field systems have the same type of
capabilities as the growth room and the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse-based systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I went to Thailand was to,
I didn't realize there's a big problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with flooding of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice in Thailand can be under water for a
significant period of time and under very
[SPEAKER_00]: deep water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Apichat, who's the director of the
research center there, has developed these
[SPEAKER_00]: ponds where he's going to grow rice under
actually five meters of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wants to see what happens
phenotypically with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're developing a system very much
like the field system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rails that move across the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the gantry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The imaging system is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be moved up and down and can do the
types of measurements, which I've already
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what was the operation of this
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, you have to tell the
system which plants you're studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a conveyor-based system
with pots in trays, then you have a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the software which says, what are these
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they within the tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the pot, there are barcodes and
ORFID identification tabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are collated against the map
that you make of the system in the tray
[SPEAKER_00]: register.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then every time that pot or that tray
moves through the system, or it might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: GPS location in the field, it collates all
the data you've ever collected for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular plant or pot in the database
with that reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing when you've got trays on the
conveyor system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conveyor feeds into the imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have lines which are just sitting
there and under defined environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For growth, you can have lines which are
the operation lines which are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can randomize the plants on these
lines so that you're not always measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: plant number one at noon and plant number
285 at 4 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would skew your data as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are randomization programs which
allow you to move the plants around in
[SPEAKER_00]: space and make sure that you don't measure
the same plants at the same time all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of automated experimental
protocols so that you can set up lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, preconditions, watering
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say, for these given sets of
plants, over this time do eight rounds
[SPEAKER_00]: through these various imaging stations and
do these particular measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those measurements then all the data
are collated in the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: The network is we have the various imaging
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were collecting huge amounts of
complex data like from chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence or from hyperspectral,
they have their individual PCs with their
[SPEAKER_00]: own database which then transfers the data
to the main database for less complex
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements such as RGB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal and color analysis, the data goes
directly to the database.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analysis of the data can be done
remotely from any computer which has
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed access to the central server.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have numerous people working on
the data at any one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to the client to decide who
gets the access and how much access they
[SPEAKER_00]: get for both control and for data
manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can recalculate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do lots of wonderful things with
the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we use it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look for abiotic stresses, biotic
stresses, plant growth analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: trait discovery, as I mentioned before,
nutrient stress, ecotoxicology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do it in both the lab and the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the various stations that we have,
I'll just go through them one by one,
[SPEAKER_00]: RGB and structural imaging, very
straightforward, typically three cameras,
[SPEAKER_00]: one above, two at the sides at 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives you rudimentary 3D
reconstruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better if you actually rotate the
plant on a stage, take multiple images
[SPEAKER_00]: from different angles, and then you can
get a beautiful 3D reconstruction for your
[SPEAKER_00]: morphological studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the software will allow you to
compute numerous parameters, morphological
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters, and you can plot spidergrams
to show how different plants within a
[SPEAKER_00]: population differ in terms of,
for example, the area, the perimeter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the compactness, the roundness,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy to compare them using these
spidergrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then within individual plants,
you can see how these parameters,
[SPEAKER_00]: individual parameters change over the
course of time when you're doing a time
[SPEAKER_00]: cost study looking at, for example,
plant architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all automated data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a water stress experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data are plotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing that because I'm not pressing
the laser pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're plotted conventionally on time
course graphs as well to see how,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, the area of the plant
declines as drought kicks in against the
[SPEAKER_00]: controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have the spidergrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have automated color analysis
because color changes with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: infection with chlorophyll content,
with carotenoid content, and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: define your color groups within the
software, as many color groups as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, and the software will automatically
say at time zero, it had X percent of sick
[SPEAKER_00]: green, Y percent of healthy green,
and Z percent of dark green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with time, it will show you how
those greenness indicators change
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 3D scanning option as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These three camera things about the plant
have been criticized by some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get some artifacts due to the
plant moving as you're rotating on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be more convenient to have the
plant move across the plant, the camera
[SPEAKER_00]: move across the plant so that you scan the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be done really, really quickly
and gives you extremely fine resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Downside is it costs a lot more,
a lot more to have a 3D scanner than it
[SPEAKER_00]: does to have three conventional cameras
with a rotating stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can track leaf movement using this RGB
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are overlaid responsive Arabidopsis
leaf movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is zooming in on one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we can do is the software
will automatically allow you to segregate
[SPEAKER_00]: these into individual leaves so you can
track parameters leaf by leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just plant by plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can plot all of those parameters
leaf by leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal imaging, I've been talking to a
number of people this morning about
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use FLIR cameras to do this typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: These slides are fairly self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the temperature of the plants
and the leaves as the stomata open.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf greater evapotranspiration allows
the leaf to cool itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some plants which like to take a
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave the stomata open.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cool themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowing CO2 going in,
but they're losing a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other plants are more conservative and
they say, oh, highlight, close my stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't want it to dry out,
but whoa, my photosynthesis has gone down
[SPEAKER_00]: now and therefore potentially I've got
less yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balancing act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plants are conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are risk takers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can determine, you can see the
difference between them by looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stomata close, the temperature goes up
quite obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it also in osmotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a false color images of plants
which have been subjected to osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress here against control plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the temperature profile
changes very, very quickly and very
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the stress versus the control
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyperspectral measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to a number of people in the
department this morning about
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperspectral measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, you hit the leaf with a broad
wavelength of light, a full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: light, say from 400 to 2,500 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the biochemical status of the
leaf, it's going to absorb or reflect
[SPEAKER_00]: different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by measuring those reflected
wavelengths and applying them to
[SPEAKER_00]: reflective indices, these calculations,
you can look at the biochemical status
[SPEAKER_00]: with respect to chlorophyll content,
carotenoid content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at highlight stress through
measure of PRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at water content as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just some of the dozens of
reflective indices that are available in
[SPEAKER_00]: the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are discovering more and more
of these as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: NDVI is a common measurement which
indicates chlorophyll content amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study in which Arabidopsis have
been subjected to different concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: of Roundup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see at 2% Roundup after 50
hours, a very, very different NDVI as
[SPEAKER_00]: shown on this false color palette compared
to the control values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these data are also plotted here to
see the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just point out where the
change occurs temporally because I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back to this slide later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative water content using hyperspectral
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are water absorbance bands about
1,400, 1,900 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant is fully hydrated,
these bands are very, very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you put the plant through a dehydration
cycle, they become much more shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to see, easy to visualize a false
color palette showing fully hydrated
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less blue there is, the less water
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see over a period of a drying
cycle, the water changes in water content
[SPEAKER_00]: are very, very easy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're at a point now where we can
resolve about a 1% of fresh weight change
[SPEAKER_00]: in water using these hyperspectral
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing I want to focus on is
chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll fluorescence, I mean,
this is an ancient experiment everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: does in bio 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shine white light at a suspension,
a chloroplast, you see red light because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fluorescing at a higher wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why and how does this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is your Z scheme of
photosynthesis from Plant Physiology 301.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the absorption of a photon,
releases electrons from P680.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are accepted by primary electron
acceptor QA, passed through the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport chain to photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light absorbed by P700 releases electrons
which are taken up by ferredoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ferredoxin is used to reduce NADPH and
that is used to reduce CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: All works very beautifully, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem occurs during stress when things
go south and here or along the electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there are problems, when the stomata
close and photosynthesis is limited,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does not stop absorption of light by
photosystem 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not stop the release of these
high-energy electrons but that energy has
[SPEAKER_00]: got to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be dissipated as heat through
what we call non-photochemical quenching
[SPEAKER_00]: or it can be dissipated as fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fluorescence that we measure to
get an indication of the degree of stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: the onset, the time of unstress and the
progression of stress in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we start off by putting the plant in
the dark and we give tiny, tiny pulses of
[SPEAKER_00]: light which are non-actinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, they don't stimulate the
dark reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant under those circumstances,
all of the electrons, there's no electrons
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to the electron transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fully oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what we do is we give a huge flash of
light, usually 5,000 micromoles of
[SPEAKER_00]: photons, twice full sunlight for about 0.8
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that there's a huge flux of
electrons from here through this electron
[SPEAKER_00]: transport chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got nowhere to go because
these enzymes are not operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that you get maximum
fluorescence yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get this peak of fluorescence here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do a couple of calculations,
you get what you call the quantum yield in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark adapted state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Fb over Fm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically in a healthy plant,
that has a conservative value of about
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.8, 0.82.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as plants become stressed,
that value declines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people use this as the
primary indicator of stress, which in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion is not a good idea for reasons
I'll get on to later.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do in our imaging systems is we
push this further.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the dark adaptation period,
we turn the light on and we continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: image the chlorophyll fluorescence
kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens then is that you get an
initial peak of fluorescence because the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic enzymes are not active.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you get activation of CO2 fixation,
this fluorescence becomes less because of
[SPEAKER_00]: course the electrons are now flowing
through the Z scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come down then to a steady state
fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: By giving a saturating pulse at this
point, you can look at what is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantum yield of photosystem 2 in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light adapted state.
[SPEAKER_00]: How efficient is photosynthesis in the
light adapted state?
[SPEAKER_00]: We measured a whole pile of other
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having measured that light adapted
quantum yield, if we know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic photon flux density is,
we know how much light we're putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: there in terms of micromoles of photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that one photon releases one
electron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the proportion of light
activating photosystem 2 versus
[SPEAKER_00]: photosystem 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know the proportion of light which
is absorbed by the leaf, typically about
[SPEAKER_00]: 82%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually get a measurement of
electron transport rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes an extremely good proxy for
photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to spend a lot of time
measuring photosynthetic rate on thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing chlorophyll fluorescence over a
period of a few seconds to a few minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can measure thousands of plants
simultaneously almost and get very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very good proxy for photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plot of the photosynthetic rate
measured by chlorophyll fluorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: against assimilation rate measured by more
conventional means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice linear relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a very good proxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this in, I showed you the movie,
so you've seen the LEDs giving the light
[SPEAKER_00]: pulses and the saturated flashes to
measure the basic parameters and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about the imaging is that
not only can you see these values,
[SPEAKER_00]: these fluorescent values on an average
basis per plant and per leaf, you can also
[SPEAKER_00]: see them pixel by pixel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a disease which is
spreading through the leaf, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the progression, the proportion of that
leaf which is being diseased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this so nice?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go back to our NDVI measurement
here, we see that chlorophyll degradation,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you've treated it, we round up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you see anything, it takes about 13
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at changes in morphology,
we're looking at 20 hours before you see
[SPEAKER_00]: anything measurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at some of the kinetic imaging
with chlorophyll fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can see the effect starting within two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're really interested in when the
onset of stress occurs, then this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: very rapid way of seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you want to do amelioration
effects, you can start putting in your
[SPEAKER_00]: ameliorations here and seeing how it's
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do that easily with these other
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drought stress in turfgrass, some work we
did for Texas A&M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quickly, FV over FM over a four-day period
without watering didn't change at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.81, 0.81.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only after seven days that we saw a
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these other parameters like the
fluorescence decline ratio, which I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: onto in a moment, and non-photochemical
quenching had changed quite significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: by four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to do this in the light-adapted
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just do the FV over FM
measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here, this is the fluorescence
decline ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at this peak value,
but we're compared to what happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the changes in control values
versus treated values.
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences occur in this quenching
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to measure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to measure them to
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where you're going to find your
signatures for trait discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Salt stress in arabidopsis, we look at FV
over FM, there's no change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameter until about four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you look at the fluorescence
decline ratio, it changes within two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just looking at the images,
you can see the very distinct difference
[SPEAKER_00]: when you apply these to a false color
palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was interesting, a study done by the
young lady you saw in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was interested in starting such
mutants of arabidopsis and how they might
[SPEAKER_00]: be related to osmotic protection during
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had mutants of phosphoglucomutase,
alpha-amylase, beta-amylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the fluorescence
characteristics of these, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: change in the FV over FM when you impose
the stress on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the phosphoglucomutase mutant,
if you look at this parameter,
[SPEAKER_00]: FP over FO, no change from the initial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the others, change very
significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know the basis for this,
but it's interesting that when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: survivability of these mutants,
it's the phosphoglucomutase mutant which
[SPEAKER_00]: survived and the others had a very poorer
survivability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion for this, I would argue
is that FV over FM in some cases is
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable, but it's a blunt instrument for
looking at stress, particularly rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light adapted kinetics provide earlier
indications, and more significant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got this balance between plant
phenotyping, one in a huge throughput,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means measure everything as quickly
as possible, and the problem of measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: things properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can collect a huge amount of data
very, very quickly, collect a huge amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of useless data very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can spend your time and collect
more useful data, and it's up to you to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide on your experimental designs,
which of those two approaches you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just very briefly, a root screen,
I've talked to some people this morning
[SPEAKER_00]: about root screen, so I thought I'd throw
this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really difficult to screen
roots, phenotypically very, very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the soil, what are you gonna do
with imaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using translucent tubes is fine,
there's been a lot of fine work done
[SPEAKER_00]: imaging just with RGB cameras,
plants grown in gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is they're grown in gels.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root characteristics are not gonna be
the same as in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In translucent tubes is the same,
well it's not the same because you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, but you have to wait for the plant
to grow before the roots hit the periphery
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tube where you can actually see
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in what happens in
early germination, etc, you're not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only 5 to 10% of these roots are
gonna be visible at the edge of a typical
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, and you have to extrapolate your
morphological parameters back to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: root system, which is not something I
would be comfortable doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low dose x-rays, plants grown in plastic
beads, these are great, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually, there's wonderful videos
on the web of roots growing when there be
[SPEAKER_00]: an x-ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're in plastic beads,
it's a hydroponic system, it's not soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground penetrating radar, there's guys at
Texas A&M, I've talked to some people this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning about how this is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a long, long way before we're
gonna be able to see roots using ground
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration radar, just too much
interference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one I think is most promising is
rhizotron studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a system developed at Eulic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rhizotrons here, the plants are
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizotrons, these are root boxes with
perspex in the front so we can image the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots as they go through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow vertically downwards,
and then when they hit this 45 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: angle, they spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can see a much greater
proportion of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than you would in, say, a translucent pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some nice data have come out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd refer you to this paper in functional
plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a 16 megapixel camera, they've got
very good resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at root length, branching rate,
spatial distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something which we're hoping to
integrate into our plant screen systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna finish off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been rabbiting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These systems are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hide the fact they are quite
complex, very sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take up a lot of area, typically in a
growth room in a greenhouse if you wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: do thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conveyor belt systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do things less expensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, plant by plant if you have
enough people to go around your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: put your leaf under this leaf clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get beautiful chlorophyll
fluorescence kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also do this in algae using a
probe which you can put into a submerged
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not imaging data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's average data over the area of the
optical window of these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get the full quenching parameters
using this device, this FloraPen device.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also get downloads via Bluetooth,
graphical representation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go out in the field and you can
make lots and lots of measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a system which will cost you maximum
about $3,500 including your measuring
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active radiation,
even GPS location in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of your kinetic values.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other devices specifically for
hyperspectral measurements like NDVI and
[SPEAKER_00]: PRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are specific for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: A single pen will do each of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends who I had dinner with last
night now tell me that they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: building systems for even a tenth of the
cost of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cost about $1,200, $1,300.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys here at Cornell are so bright
they can throw them together for 200
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't buy them from me, buy them from
those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have also though is a polypen
which is a handheld spectrophotometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of versions of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spectropen in which there's no
leaf clip and you can point this at any
[SPEAKER_00]: light source and it'll give you a
beautiful spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for calibrating light sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for going into your growth
rooms and seeing whether your light
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday is the same as it was today,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do all types of chromaticity
measurements with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have the leaf clip here,
you can get a full reflectance scan across
[SPEAKER_00]: these ranges, 380 to 780, 640 to 1050
nanometers from which you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically calculated your reflective
indices indicative of the pigment
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations in the plant and various
other biochemical status of the plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would recommend if any of you have
large amounts of money and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: spend it on plant phenotyping systems,
you can make very expensive mistakes by
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest that you try before you
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, all you need to do is jump
on a plane to the Czech Republic,
[SPEAKER_00]: this beautiful place in Drazhov.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have PhD level plant scientists.
