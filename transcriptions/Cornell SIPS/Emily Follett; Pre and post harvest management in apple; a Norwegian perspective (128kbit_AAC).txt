[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, Yousef, for the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, today I'll be talking about pre
and post-harvest management in apple,
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on a Norwegian perspective,
kind of giving some insight into the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that, yes, we can grow apples in Norway
and how we grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be a sufficient amount of
beautiful pictures to just show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so you're aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like right outside my office.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or pretty close to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's in my town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a kind of general brief overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it overall background of a
little bit about Norway and my institute
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fruit growing in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tie it into explaining a little bit about
the climate of Norway and how that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, and then specifically how it
impacts post-harvest, certain disorders,
[SPEAKER_00]: since that's what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tying in some new cultivars that
we've just had and how that impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest research, how that impacts my
research, and leading that into my PhD and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially why am I even at Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to talk about me,
but Yosef pretty much did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm from Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want that to be said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not Norwegian, full-on American,
went to undergrad here, worked for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years in Western New York,
and then decided I needed to learn how to
[SPEAKER_00]: do research properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a master's also in Norway because
I wanted more cold and more winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, let's go to Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I found out they had fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did my thesis at Nibio, the institute
that I work at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now as part of my position as a
scientist, I am doing a PhD in partnership
[SPEAKER_00]: with Nibio, my university in Norway,
and now with Cornell as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the overall connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also don't expect everyone to have a
grasp of where Norway is and why this is
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, Norway is way up here,
way at the tippity top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about the same latitude as Anchorage,
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the Gulf Stream,
it's warmer than in Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can grow more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can grow apples commercially,
whereas in Alaska, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the general context of why
I can even be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: on apples in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, my institute is kind of this
combination of extension and USDA and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different culminations of applied
agricultural research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a fairly large institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 750 employees over 15 different
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's positioned in different spots to
focus on whatever commodity is grown or
[SPEAKER_00]: produced there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of aquaculture up north
and Arctic sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of grasslands and forestry
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big apple near me is my
research station, which focuses just on
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, Norway is super long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really ragged, jagged coastline.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little arable land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 3% of the country is arable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some unique challenges just
based on the geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we zoom in on my station, these are
some of our orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: This big long building right here is our
office building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then down here, we have a lab building
with windows facing us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's facing over the fjord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our station has been around for 75
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was created to support fruit growers in
the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are right in the middle of one of
the largest growing regions for apples in
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty strategic placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 10 researchers and technicians that
work with every aspect of fruit research
[SPEAKER_00]: from cultivar and rootstock selection all
the way through post-harvest and cider
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of collaboration both
nationally and internationally with
[SPEAKER_00]: business and researchers, other
researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially given the scale of
Norwegian fruit production, I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: have pretty good infrastructure overall
for free research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we dig more into fruit industry in
Norway in general, here in Norway,
[SPEAKER_00]: we classify it as fruit and berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fruit is like all tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do work on berries a lot,
too, because there is a lot of berry
[SPEAKER_00]: growth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work with it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to talk about tree
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Norway, it's primarily apple,
plum, cherry, and pear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty small acreage, 4,000 acres of
apple total.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a small country with 5
million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't need to be a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this other impact of the
northern latitude, obviously affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we can grow the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the southern part of
Norway, which is the only part of Norway
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's warm enough to grow fruit,
we have three major growing regions,
[SPEAKER_00]: one right near Oslo, one in Telemark,
right in the middle here, which if you ski
[SPEAKER_00]: is where Telemark skiing was originated,
one on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I work right here, so right in the
middle of this section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you notice on the map, the big
connector piece here is fjords or lakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this picture shows, you're growing
right up to the fjord or the lake,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you really need to take advantage
of the moderated climate from the bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: of water to even be able to grow anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's all in fjords,
fjords tend to be mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes straight very steeply down into
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we are often growing on
really steep gradients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're growing wherever you can,
in whatever amount of space you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not uncommon where you see like
100 trees planted in between somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: house and another house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're just using all the space
that you can possibly get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given that, I still think we have a
fairly modern production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use normal trellis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to plant north-south, but that's
really directed by the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just have to plant however
you can plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with that, sometimes you can't
get a tractor up it, so you have to use an
[SPEAKER_00]: ATV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we have these special sleds with treads
on them that can hold one bin of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is planted on M9 rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We import all our trees from the
Netherlands for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have been producing apples in the
same region since the 1200s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, we haven't been on M9
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same areas have been used for
growing apples for 800 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that we're all using the same
rootstock is kind of fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few chemical thinners used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly hand thinning or no
thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often too cold to use for chemical
thinners to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it's also our largest volume
apple often gets too large if you thin it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what the growers say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then go into biannual year,
or biannual bearing, but at least you have
[SPEAKER_00]: sellable fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have limited pesticides,
especially compared to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar to in the rest of the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some pesticides, there's just not
enough of a market of people who want
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the companies don't want to register
them in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do think is kind of unique is that
all our cherries are grown in tunnels to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent rain cracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from June to July, haper fields are
just covered in white plastic because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much rain that it's easy for
the cherries to crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to commercially produce cherries,
they have to be under tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't use reflective fabric or tunnels
or anything or hail nets for anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for cherries, we exclusively use
tunnels.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the single-use plastic for that
season?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we try to reuse it a couple times,
the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually lasts like 5 to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it left on the whole time, or is it on
and off?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we take off the fabric in the winter,
or in August, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only a couple months out of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we obviously have it off for
pollination as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, if we talk closer to harvest,
we produce about 20,000 metric tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: apples per year, generally from small
orchards and family farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because we have this long history,
sometimes they've been in the same family
[SPEAKER_00]: for 600 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's mostly co-op packing houses where
a number of growers deliver to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: packing house and own the packing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the small scale of farming,
it's often part-time farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers will have another job on
top of farming as well, which complicates
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I guess I previously mentioned,
there's a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it often means that we're harvesting in
the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, if it rains one day,
you're like, oh, well, I'll wait until the
[SPEAKER_00]: next day when the apple's dry to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did that in September in Norway,
you would never pick a single apple
[SPEAKER_00]: because it rains every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something that we have to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn to love the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know it affects the apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past 30 years, the strategy for
apple production has been to sell it as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast as possible, basically get everything
out before the beginning of December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taxes on imported apples until
December 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only time that Norwegian
apples have historically been competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Norway wants to be more
self-sustainable right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is currently one of the least
self-sustainable countries in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fruit is one of the ways it can be
self-sustainable in the fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least in apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a bigger focus on trying to
increase both the quality during the
[SPEAKER_00]: current selling season of Norwegian apples
and extend the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this renewed interest in
post-harvest all of a sudden in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, there's also a
resurgence in the cider industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me like a very similar trend
to what's been happening in New York the
[SPEAKER_00]: past 10, 15 years with lots of on-farm
sales, lots of marketing, lots of look at
[SPEAKER_00]: how lovely this product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is quite great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a similar style, I think,
to New York's style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really helped the industry a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said I'd talk specifically about the
weather, so we'll go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the reminder,
again, that everything is due to the Gulf
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to directly compare Ithaca and
my region of Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the next few graphs, Norway will be
in green and Ithaca will be in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the graph on the left is the average
temperature throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think is interesting here is
the high temperature in Norway during the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season is about, let's say,
a couple degrees warmer than the low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never gets warm in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun makes it feel warm, but
degrees-wise, it never gets very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, this impacts growing degree
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is growing degree days based on a
10 degree scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, Norway gets about 10 degrees or
about half the growing degree days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: season as Ithaca gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a big impact on what we can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is right on a fjord to the most
optimal conditions that you can get for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things everybody knows
about Norway, if you know something about
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway, is the midnight sun, the long
daylight hours, and the long night hours
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's so much light, maybe that
has an impact on or it can help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season even if the
temperatures are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on this graph on the left,
which is the hours of daylight,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's four hours more daylight during
most of the growing season in Norway than
[SPEAKER_00]: in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the graph on the right is the incident
radiation, so it actually would hit the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you notice here is that it's
always lower in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: than in Ithaca, even though we have four
hours more daylight per day in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question there, my question
immediately was, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings me back to the,
oh, it's always raining in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is average monthly precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is the lowest month
for precipitation in Norway still has more
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation than the most you'll get in
Ithaca on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is always raining in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the Norwegian growing
season, which is May 1st to September
[SPEAKER_00]: 30th, Ithaca gets 64 days of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway gets 104.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within a five-month period,
we have more than a month more days of
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is always raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to affect fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plus side is we get awesome rainbows
and we get our own gigantic falls look
[SPEAKER_00]: alike in my town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're focusing on apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we then go into what apples we
actually grow, we primarily have five
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars, Aroma, this one being
the main variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also grow Discovery, Red
Gravenstein, Summer Red, and Rubenstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we harvest in late August through
early October.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were completely unknown varieties to
me before I moved to Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason for that is that
they're all really summer varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for context, we have a rootstock
planting of Gala that ripens in early to
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-October.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, that's early to
mid-September.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a month difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really debatable if we can even
commercially grow Gala because it's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: edge of our growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we only have summer
varieties for the rest of the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: why our varieties aren't necessarily
relevant historically to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for storage, as stated, our late-season
storing varieties really aren't late
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mid-season at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Gala comparatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gala can generally be stored for like
eight, nine months in optimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're seeing with our
storage varieties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see, because a lot of them are
early season varieties, that they lose
[SPEAKER_00]: firmness really quickly, which is typical
of summer varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick them and they're soft if you look
at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to complicate everything,
1MCP, which is super common ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitor, used in the US commercially for
25 years, was just approved last year in
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're catching up at a rapid pace to
the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have some setbacks that we've been
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another setback there is that we
generally harvest the fruit too right for
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term storage, in part because of the
tradition of just sell the fruit as fast
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want the nicest fruit if you're
selling it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you harvest it late.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we still pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we still sell the earliest-picked fruit
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the best fruit for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we end up storing the
late-harvested fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the worst fruit for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be this reconstruction
of how people think about how to store
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have harvest requirements that
aren't based on storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on direct sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this really long harvest
window where growers are allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest for three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the compounding factor of
fruit being in the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also don't have internal defects orders
on packing lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have external ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything on the outside, we can sort
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's any browning or anything
wrong inside, we can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't actually know how big of a
problem internal disorders are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really quickly to emphasize the
loss of firmness, this is in aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main cultivar, which is a mid-season
variety in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But according to Geneva, it ripens in
August 25th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty early season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This green line is the requirement it
needs to be at at packing for firmness
[SPEAKER_00]: level, which is five kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: At harvest, it's usually six to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it loses that by about six weeks of
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to store it for nine
weeks, optimally, with some firmness left
[SPEAKER_00]: during shelf life, which it clearly
doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1MCP application and CI help,
but we don't know for how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never going to be a six-month storage
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: To complicate that, bringing in the
disorders finally, we also get soft scald
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, which is a really common chilling
injury, common on honeycrisp as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have ways to mitigate it that are
similar to how you mitigate it in
[SPEAKER_00]: honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in honeycrisp, you can condition it
for seven days at 10 degrees and then
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it down to a cooler temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with aroma, it gets soft so fast that
you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to debate if you want soft
scald or you want soft fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the constant debate we have to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some evidence that growth
growing season seems to affect it and
[SPEAKER_00]: weather seems to affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no consistent indications of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other common disorder of honeycrisp,
so honeycrisp, it's often soft scald,
[SPEAKER_00]: bitter pit are talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have bitter pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not at significant levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it also in aroma as you do soft
scald.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calcium sprays generally work,
but it's hard to find scientific proof
[SPEAKER_00]: that they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is variation between seasons,
which is what we see in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just never at high amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 5% is a high year for bitter
pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, I think it's just not
warm enough in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be cultivar susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just the temperatures are
never warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The calcium can be distributed into the
fruit for a longer portion of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as much of an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have hard evidence for this,
but this is just my general train of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought and some positive to the cold
growing season perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also seen a rise in other
lenticill disorders that are not bitter
[SPEAKER_00]: pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to decide what is what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, we've seen more in recent
years, which could be linked to climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and a slightly warming climate and
a wetter climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a general observation right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway has decided to follow the trends of
the rest of the world recently in that
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have no variety that's really,
really good for storage, we need something
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be stored better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also need something that's
crispier, juicier, sweeter, attractive to
[SPEAKER_00]: the new consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a honeycrisp type of apple in
Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the largest distributor decided to
choose two crossings from the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_00]: and start planting those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they both have the same two parents,
SQ159, which is a Dutch variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is called Eden in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's red and orange, pretty firm,
crunchy, super sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing you taste is sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second is Fried, which is
your more classic-looking variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: firm, crunchy, sweet, but more balanced
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You taste it, or I taste it and think,
this tastes like honeycrisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great that we have new varieties
that can attract a different consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, following the trend can have
consequences, as we might be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there seems to be this equation where
if you breed a new variety that has
[SPEAKER_00]: honeycrisp parentage, it's often not
tested enough, and it often has problems
[SPEAKER_00]: once it's commercially planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Norway has followed that same trend,
where you have a honeycrisp parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have commercial planting, started
without prior research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for context, the oldest trees in Norway
are six years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first commercial production year was
2020, and that was the first year we could
[SPEAKER_00]: start research on these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has led to biannual bearing,
unsurprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This picture is extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to show it, but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, lots of disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two common things that you get with
this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been great for my research,
at least, because it gives me two things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are relevant across at least the post
harvest industry across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two things I'm looking at in my
research are core browning and water core.
[SPEAKER_00]: So core browning, just super briefly,
is often worse in cold climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be part of why we see it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in both Eden and Free,
but it's also seen in honeycrisp and
[SPEAKER_00]: evercrisp, which is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a honeycrisp and Fuji offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I think is really interesting
here is that Eden and Free seem to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different causes of core browning,
despite being so similarly related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eden, it seems to be very senescent
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Free, it seems to be a variety of
factors influencing it, not one factor
[SPEAKER_00]: directly cause of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same with honeycrisp and
evercrisp, is that there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting combination of factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All adding up to disorder incidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the discrepancies within
similar cultivars is fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then water core is technically a
pre-harvest disorder, but it's excess
[SPEAKER_00]: sorbitol accumulation in the intercellular
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen it historically in
Norway, but it's only been very
[SPEAKER_00]: stress-related water core, which is very
externally visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pick it out on packing lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really a big problem
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically, it's related to heat waves and
warm growing seasons in Norway,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it never gets really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's warm enough that if it's warm
near harvest, it will cause water core.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, Eden, one of the new varieties,
gets a different type of water core called
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity water core.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens mostly in the core and is not
externally visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sometimes related to cool
temperatures near harvest, AKA the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season in Norway, and increases
with later ripening and later harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the current marketing is that they
want to pick this fruit really late,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it's an orange background color,
we get up to 76% water core at harvest in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially picked fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see it also in Evercrisp,
one of the Honeycrisp and Fuji cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in contrast, Eden is more problematic
because the water core can turn brown
[SPEAKER_00]: within two to three weeks after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to figure out how to
prevent water core from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Eden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to see why it acts so
differently in Eden and Evercrisp,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they're related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me quickly to my thesis,
which is a similar title to my talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre- and post-harvest factors in relation
to physiological disorder development for
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable apple production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in collaboration with Nibio
Cornell and NMBU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is I'm looking mostly
at core browning and water core,
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to dig into the causes a little
bit and the growing season and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: region factors that could impact disorder
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't necessarily go into all these
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I briefly go over the general
methods just so it's understandable why
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it here and why it could be
applied here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for core browning, I'm looking at
different storage temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: different storage treatments in all three
varieties over multiple years to compare
[SPEAKER_00]: how the same treatments affect the fruit
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll look at, I'll dig into ethylene
receptor gene expression as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mostly a applied storage trial to
really try to understand why core browning
[SPEAKER_00]: in Eden is senescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And related and why it's not in Evercrisp
and Freed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how variety and growing season
differences and growing region differences
[SPEAKER_00]: affect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For water core, there's a couple different
sections of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at water core development on
the tree and near harvest at different
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest times in both Eden and Evercrisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to see if pattern development,
like if incidence development is similar
[SPEAKER_00]: across the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if that affects a certain part
of the sorbitol metabolism pathway in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way or in different ways in the two
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also doing kind of the
reverse in storage because water core can
[SPEAKER_00]: go away in storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sorbitol can be taken up by the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I want to see if this process
happens similarly in the two cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Eden and Evercrisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also if the gene expression in
the metabolism pathway is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse of at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, I want to look and see
if you can, while here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: use some of the nano x-ray technology to
see if you can track the same fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: through storage to watch the dissipation
in one fruit over another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time and watch the sorbitol kind of
go away in a way or be absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final part that's relevant to
Cornell is I want to look at the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: rootstocks on water core incidence and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be done at the two rootstock
planting trials of Evercrisp in Geneva and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally with a couple different harvest
timings and looking at differences in
[SPEAKER_00]: sorbitol accumulation, water core
development, and then because it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: two locations, looking at growing region
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the ultimate goal of eventually maybe
this can be then applied in Norway with
[SPEAKER_00]: eventual rootstock plantings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's what I had to say really about
basically why I'm here, why my research
[SPEAKER_00]: could be at all relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wanted to end with my actual
office views.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a corner office.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look out on these two views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is my field office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a plug is we have a post-harvest
pathology conference happening hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: in spring 2026 in Norway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to see these views in
person, you're welcome to come for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Field questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the soils like on the slope?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me there's not a whole lot of
weathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Marvin's asking about the
different soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very organic, actually,
because it's so cold that there is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of erosion at times, because you can have
landslides and avalanches and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nothing decomposes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really high organic matter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the other basis for the
soils, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I maybe should.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're relatively deep?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, do you have drainage issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are relatively deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they work well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's one question in the chat
from Thomas saying, is there any potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for newer varieties used in central
Sweden, like Rödluben, Silva, and Fredrik?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not known for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard of any of those varieties,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do often, most of our varieties
actually come from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tend to grow the same things as in
Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is potential that we could use
those as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about your rootstocks, you said in
Norway, it's 800 years cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how is it that in 2014, it seems like
there's one rootstock that seems to be
[SPEAKER_04]: replacing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems pretty dangerous to have one
rootstock.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think over 800 years,
there would be some resistance that builds
[SPEAKER_04]: up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is there any effort to try to look
for that and put that into the breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: line in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is about why we still use
the same rootstock after, or yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: why everything has grown on M9,
even though we've been growing for 800
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and how that impacts different
resistance to diseases and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, and if we're looking into
it, so we do have rootstock plantings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're part of the Eurofin network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do look into different
rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem really is that
commercially, because we have such low
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes, it's hard to ask for very
specific varieties on very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a large part of why we
all have M9, is because we just can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else other than just M9,
because the nurseries don't want to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: us anything other than just M9.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we can steer away from that
and towards more variation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rootstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is dangerous to plant on the
same ground for so long, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question has a little bit of
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's that I'm from Ontario,
Canada, where in the 1980s, the provincial
[SPEAKER_05]: government spent many millions of dollars
paying great growers to pull out cultivars
[SPEAKER_05]: that didn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they gave them money to put in
cultivars that work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's 5,000 acres of apple trees
in Norway, and all of these problems,
[SPEAKER_05]: such as the cultivars aren't right,
and there's one rootstock, and that sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of thing, has Norway, it would never
happen here in the States, but has Norway
[SPEAKER_05]: considered just paying the growers to pull
them all out and put in some robust
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question's about why don't we just
take out the ones that don't, the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that don't work and put in new
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, government pay for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Grower dollars as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're struggling with these cultivars
that don't seem to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the two new cultivars were
supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this big push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eden and Friede have been the two most
highly planted cultivars ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Norway, it's a lot of trees planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were supposed to bring along the new
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not working so far, because they
didn't do enough testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that might go along eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also this pushback where some
people want the traditional varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they don't store well or
anything, because that's a Norwegian
[SPEAKER_00]: apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Norwegian apple is supposed to be soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Norwegian apple is supposed to smell
like rock, because that's just the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: of Norwegian apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in some ways, it could be good
to just kind of reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to have enough knowledge
about the varieties that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the key problem that we've
learned now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, great presentation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess my question is in regards to the
biannual bearing habits.
[SPEAKER_09]: So from what I gather from the
presentation, that seems to be kind of the
[SPEAKER_09]: trend in the way that the orchard's
managed.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's very little thinning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it all is hand-thinning,
do you think that's going to be kind of an
[SPEAKER_09]: issue with climate change, kind of the
more prominent in the future, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: With like, they spring frosts.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking, like, if you're
managing the orchard biannually,
[SPEAKER_09]: you have a frost event, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Then your crop's going bye-bye,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there a crop insurance plan that the
grower couldn't buy into for that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was about different
biannual, or like, how biannual bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: system essentially is going to be impacted
by climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's definitely a push
towards preventing biannual bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a push towards more annual
bearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's going to be the
solution, frankly, to biannual bearing and
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change is annual production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, and with the warming
climate, chemical thinners will work
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it will be easier, hopefully,
to have an annual production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's also just getting growers
to understand the economic benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people get it, and some people
don't, or don't care enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fine with what they have right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: To clarify the rustoc issue, what was the
rustoc used by the Norwegian apple
[SPEAKER_06]: industry before 2014?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before 2014, it was also still M9 that
was used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we've been doing dwarfs,
or figuring root stocks, it's been M9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just before 2014, we weren't
allowed to buy trees from other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to produce everything internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 2014, it was allowed for us to buy
it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: By looking at the temperature,
sort of the seasonal change of
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature, average temperatures,
the area where apples are grown in Norway,
[SPEAKER_06]: actually, the temperatures are higher than
in Africa during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, during the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a much more stable climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cold damage or winter freezing damage
is rarely an issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a big problem, for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wondering a little bit more about the
cider industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they using these culinary varieties,
or do they have different traditional
[SPEAKER_10]: varieties that they've been using for
cider?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they bringing in varieties from other
parts of Europe, or what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cider industry is mostly based off
of the dessert apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really big on single varietal
ciders, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also marketing for a specific
aroma cider and a specific gravenstein
[SPEAKER_00]: cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are bringing in British cider
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bringing back some old traditional
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of it is leftover from industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's industry fruit, with some people
growing specifically for cider.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll solve your post-harvest issue
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely does a lot for it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you mean by culinary varieties?
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought those are fresh apples.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apples for fresh markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Culinary means for cooking, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: For kitchen use?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: The term culinary can mean fresh market or
fresh eating.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess that's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The fresh market varieties, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of have a related question.
[SPEAKER_11]: How would you describe the average
consumer there in Norway compared to the
[SPEAKER_11]: US?
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they more sophisticated?
[SPEAKER_11]: They know varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: They ask for varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how much do they eat relative to,
say, typical Americans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average consumer in Norway does not
know different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they know Norwegian variety,
like one or two Norwegian varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still red, green, yellow apple a
lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also generally have because we're at
the end of the supply chain, the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: in general of our fruits and vegetables
are lower, I would say, than in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, they're less picky,
perhaps, in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I've had to become less picky
when I'm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not a traditional consumer either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very meat and potatoes country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have meat and potatoes for dinner
with a side of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also very traditional crops still,
very root vegetable based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer base is definitely getting
more adventurous and trying more things
[SPEAKER_00]: and demanding more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're just like 10 years behind
the US in trends, is my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our imports mostly come from Italy and
Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also get stuff from New Zealand and
Chile, depending on the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when possible, we try to be in Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the question was, do consumers know
their apples?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they outlabeled by variety?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, when you have Norwegian apples,
it's Norwegian red apples, this much per
[SPEAKER_00]: kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grocery stores aren't helping
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they separate out the
Norwegian apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll put Norwegian flags up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the grocery store side of it,
the distributor side of it, to really
[SPEAKER_00]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But import apples are so cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just makes it easier to just sell
import apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really have a great way to
overcome the impact of limited pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growing season and the wetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of fruit rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also can't apply pesticides or
fungicides post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't apply anything post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't apply wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to use cultural methods and try
to be good about pre-sorting fruit when we
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, the big thing we've
realized is that a lot of growers don't
[SPEAKER_00]: spray fungicides after July.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're trying to push for a spray of
fungicides in August so that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: work post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the next step that will
increase our storability a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: increase our marketable fruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has
[SPEAKER_05]: been a production of Cornell University on
the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
