[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you again for the introduction
and also thank you for the invitation to
[SPEAKER_00]: present our results here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Gillian mentioned, it's close to one
o'clock in the morning here, so apologies
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm not mentally spry tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Gillian mentioned in the
introduction, we had the Chui lab
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in biosynthesis of secondary
metabolites of filamentous fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I came here with a bit of background
and interest in metabolic engineering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I figured I would do it on ribosomal
peptides because they're much simpler in
[SPEAKER_00]: their biosynthetic logic than these mega
enzymes that Gillian already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these ribosomal peptides are also
sort of the unloved stepchildren of the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product family and fungi,
so they're vastly underexplored,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the engineering part was harder than I
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I also got into this
project, which is the elucidation of
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis of a secondary metabolite
peptide, and that was really fruitful,
[SPEAKER_00]: so today I'm going to share with you these
results of the collaboration of our lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gillian's lab, and Peter Salmon's lab at
ANU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so as Gillian mentioned,
it's about Victorian, the peptide produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by Cogliovus victori, a necrotrophic
fungus, and I'm going to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: backstory a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gillian has already done a good job of
introducing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 1940s in the United States,
oat farmers had a problem with another
[SPEAKER_00]: disease called crown rust of oats caused
by the biotrophic pathogen P. coronata,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to combat that disease, they
introduced an oat cultivator resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: crown rust of oats from Argentina,
and this cultivar is called Victoria,
[SPEAKER_00]: or was called a Victoria oat, and that
worked nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resistant to crown rust, and so it
was widely adapted and widely planted in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, within a couple of years,
a new disease emerged that selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: infected those Victoria oats, and that
disease is Victoria blight of oats caused
[SPEAKER_00]: by Cogliovus victori.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting about this
disease is that the resistance to crown
[SPEAKER_00]: rust is directly linked to the
susceptibility to Victoria blight of oats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as this disease emerged and
reached epidemic proportions in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, Victoria cultivar of oats was
quickly abandoned, so that was pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the problems with this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it still of relevance today and
why has it been looked into for decades?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of this interesting link
between susceptibility and resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this overlap between these two
pathogens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key to this overlap or the key to
at least the disease caused by Cogliovus
[SPEAKER_00]: victori is the peptide Victorian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a scientific perspective,
there's a lot of good research done over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two landmark papers I wanna point
out in 1947.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Murphy, when the disease first
emerged, they studied it, and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: found was that when they cultivated
Cogliovus victori in liquid culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of filtered the culture liquid and
sterilized it so that there was no living
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus left in the culture, filtered,
and then applied it to susceptible oats,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they observed that the simple oats
developed the same disease symptoms as if
[SPEAKER_00]: it was infected with the fungus itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first time it was
demonstrated that a fungus could secrete a
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin that by itself could cause disease
symptoms identical to infection by the
[SPEAKER_00]: same fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was in 1947.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another landmark paper was the 2007 paper
from Thomas Walpert and Jennifer Lauren
[SPEAKER_00]: and coworkers where they elucidated how
exactly that compound victorine achieved
[SPEAKER_00]: this toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it comes down to basically is
that Victorian sort of mimics a biotrophic
[SPEAKER_00]: effector and induces hypersensitive
response in the host plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So induces cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then takes advantage of that cell
death to colonize the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that work in more detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's from Thomas Walpert's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was study this interaction
in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the center of this interaction is a
phyredoxin called TRXH5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this phyredoxin is central to
radioactivity regulating plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it a target for biotrophic
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a biotrophic effector binds and
inhibits TRXH5 and downregulates plant
[SPEAKER_00]: immune responses that in the old six sec
model of host pathogen interaction leads
[SPEAKER_00]: to what's called effector triggered
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the evolutionary arms race
between host and pathogen, then some hosts
[SPEAKER_00]: develop resistance to that by employing a
guard protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guard protein monitors the TRXH5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it detects binding of the
biotrophic effector and suppression of the
[SPEAKER_00]: TRXH5, it induces the hypersensitive
response or cell death, which holds an
[SPEAKER_00]: infection by biotrophic effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's localized cell death and then the
infection by the biotroph stops at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what Victorian then does is mimic
that biotrophic effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having the same inhibitory activity
on TRXH5 as that biotrophic effector
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been defeated by the plant already,
it sort of wants to be called by the guard
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, which is LOV1 in Arabidopsis,
that then induces cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because cochlea was Victoria is a
necrotrophic fungus, it actually profits
[SPEAKER_00]: of cell death and that leads to
colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's interesting is that Victorian
has the same inhibitory effects on TRXH5,
[SPEAKER_00]: but without the guard protein,
that inhibition of the plant immune
[SPEAKER_00]: response is still not enough for cochlea
ovus to actually colonize the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's called a whole
selective toxin, as you mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's selectively only successful in
infecting plants that have that guard
[SPEAKER_00]: protein and that resistance to that
biotroph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also explains how disease
susceptibility to cochlea ovus is Victoria
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease resistance to P. coronata are
linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an interesting mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what actually is Victorian?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Victorian is a set of small cyclic
peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it, so this is Victorian,
C that I have here on the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorian C is the major constituent,
but it's a mixture of six similar
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that are very similar to
Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the structure,
it's kind of difficult to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a true cyclic peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cyclized head to tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have only peptide bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a depth C peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have an ester bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unusual amino acids suggest a non
ribosomal origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Gillian's lab did a lot of work on this
previously, and they sequenced the cochlea
[SPEAKER_00]: ovus Victoria genome in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they knocked out all the NRPS gene
clusters in cochlea ovus Victoria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but found that the mutants would still
produce Victorian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big reveal here, and I guess it's
not a big reveal anymore at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been published, is that
Victorian is what's called a RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a RIP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stands for ribosomally synthesized and
post-sensolation modified peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And RIPs have been known in bacteria and
plants for quite some time, but their
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery in filamentous fungi is fairly
recent, only over maybe a decade or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although very few of them have
actually been characterized, an abundance
[SPEAKER_00]: of hypothetical RIP gene clusters have
been found in the genomes of filamentous
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their biosynthetic logic, as I
mentioned earlier, is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the RIP is encoded directly in the
genome in what's called a precursor
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide, or as it's named here,
proprotein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the precursor peptide contains one,
or in filamentous fungi, multiple copies
[SPEAKER_00]: of the core peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the core peptide is the amino acid
sequence that makes up the backbone of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mature product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during RIP biosynthesis, these core
peptides are cleaved out of the precursor
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide and then endowed with
post-sensolation modifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily in that order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final product usually is cyclized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all characterized fungal RIPs still
cyclized at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's also important to note is that
usually these enzymes that bestow those
[SPEAKER_00]: post-sensolation modifications are encoded
in genes that are in the close vicinity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene of the precursor peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is very similar to other
filamentous fungi, secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, just showing the structure of
three characterized fungal RIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these three have in common is
that they're all cleaved by certain
[SPEAKER_00]: peptidase called kexin protease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hallmark of this kexin protease is
the conserved cut side, which is two amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, either KK or KR, or southerly RR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing these three fungal
RIPs have in common is this ether bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's extremely uncommon in fungal
natural products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you remember from earlier,
that's also what Victorian has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what gave us the idea that
Victorian might actually be a RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by us, I mean, my supervisor Heng.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, we did what Heng likes to call
retro biosynthetic analysis, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: borrowed from organic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you look at the final
product and try to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors or the building blocks are to
get to that final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we looked at the
structure and deduced hypothetical amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acid sequence that would be the backbone
of Victorian, if Victorian was a RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we used that sequence,
which was GLK, L-A-F, to query the genome
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly that Ganyan and her group had
previously created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was a single gene on a
short read, only about one KB long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of that read, there was a
gene that contained two copies of that
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence flanked by the familiar kex and
cut side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this gene had no stop codon and
also only two core peptide repeats,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very little, very uncommon,
and fungal RIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the loxin that I showed earlier,
for example, has 16 core peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gave us idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably this gene is incomplete,
also because it was at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we tried was reassemble the raw
reads from that sequencing, tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: extend this contact, but then managed,
didn't lead anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we decided was to resequence
the genome, which the majority of the work
[SPEAKER_00]: was done by Megan McDonald from ANU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we decided on was to nanopore
long-read sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to Illumina sequencing,
which is what Ganyan's group did
[SPEAKER_00]: previously, nanopore has long reads,
but lower fidelity as Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used those long reads,
polished them with the Illumina reads from
[SPEAKER_00]: Ganyan's previous sequencing effort,
and that led to the assemble of 22
[SPEAKER_00]: supercontacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this genome assembly, then we queried
again with the sequence of the core
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was actually not one,
but three copies of the precursor peptide
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, which is so far unprecedented in
fungal RIPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that was highly
unusual was that around those three
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor peptides, precursor peptide
genes, there wasn't a clear gene cluster
[SPEAKER_00]: as you usually have in fungal RIPs or even
fungal secondary metabolites, as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned earlier, but only a sort of a
diffuse clustering, big distances between
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, a lot of repeat regions and a lot
of transposons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a little bit of a analysis of
the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you can see here is just a heat
map that maps the three prime and five
[SPEAKER_00]: prime intergenic regions of the entire
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mapped those candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genes that we potentially think might
be involved in Victorian onto this heat
[SPEAKER_00]: map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that the
intergenic distances are sort of above
[SPEAKER_00]: average compared to the rest of the
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw that Sofine Camoun gave a
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He recently, he's on the YouTube playlist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he and his lab came up with
the concept of the two speed genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: where basically says that filamentous
plant pathogens sometimes have this
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic architecture where the effectors
are in genomic regions that evolve at an
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerated speed compared to the rest of
the genome, which gives the pathogen the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of sort of a faster evolution in
the arms race between pathogen and host,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time keeps like the
housekeeping and the important genes
[SPEAKER_00]: shielded from that faster evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one thing that we thought
might be going on here, might be the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason for this sort of unusual
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what I forget to mention is that
what the hallmarks of this two speed
[SPEAKER_00]: genome of these regions of accelerated
speed are gene sparsity and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: transposing in those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we observed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so just for comparison, this is the
Eustyloxine cluster, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three reps that I showed you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, a much more clean cluster,
small intergenic distances, everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: close together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just as comparison to what we
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made it a little more difficult
because when we elucidate by synthesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds from the genome side,
we usually rely on clustering,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least to help us to identify potential
genes that might be involved in assembling
[SPEAKER_00]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say if we look at an NRPS, then we know
where the NRPS gene is, but we also look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the surrounds and then have sort of the
surrounding genes as candidates for also
[SPEAKER_00]: being involved in the biosynthesis of that
non-riversome peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here though, that was a little more
difficult because the distances were
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and it was not as clear cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one way to sort of circumvent that is
to look for homologous clusters in other
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes in the hope that there's a better
clustering there and also to compare which
[SPEAKER_00]: genes are conserved between the clusters
and which ones aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was look for homologs of
the precursor peptide, which here is shown
[SPEAKER_00]: in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was two homologs in the
genomes of two distantly related fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: Apiosporum untani and Colletotrichum
ermoclii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the surroundings of
those two looked much nicer, looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: much more of a cluster, so that was
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that, we sort of made a list
of candidate genes that we suspected might
[SPEAKER_00]: be involved in Victorian biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that, we basically relied on three
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, sort of the proximity to the
precursor peptide gene, although that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't as clear cut as I mentioned,
then the homologous clusters, which genes
[SPEAKER_00]: are conserved sort of in the vicinity of
the precursor peptide genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thirdly also, what do you usually
find in fungal rib clusters?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, I should mention the
yellow genes here are DUF3328 protein
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, and DUF stands for domain of
unknown function.
[SPEAKER_00]: These genes are still a bit of a mystery
in fungal rib biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two characterized fungal ribs,
they've been shown to be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclization of fungal ribs, but there's
often a whole bunch of them in fungal rib
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, many more than is needed for
cyclization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it stands to reason that they're
probably also involved in other
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis synthetic functions that have
not been elucidated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our case, there's quite a bunch in
the vicinity of the precursor peptide gene
[SPEAKER_00]: copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genes that we decided on for
knockout was firstly, obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor peptide gene for confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we picked one of the DUF3328 protein
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also knocked out the NDPH oxidase,
although that was a dud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also knocked out the copamine
oxidase in brown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just go through these mutants that
we created one by one and talking through
[SPEAKER_00]: the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, another thing I should mention is
that in the colletotrichum cluster,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a cytogram P450, pretty clearly
clustered with the precursor peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found a homolog to that,
400 KB from the precursor peptide gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also include that in our list of
potential Victorian biosynthesis genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, yeah, Shang Hui from Glenn's lab
was a bit of heavy lifting in creating all
[SPEAKER_00]: these knockout strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one that we did was the
precursor peptide knockout mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is DeltaVicA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the LCMS data that we
received from that knockout strain was
[SPEAKER_00]: that we couldn't detect Victorian C
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said before, Victorian C is the
major consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's by far the most abundant of the
Victorian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was somewhat surprising because
for this strain, only one copy of the
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor peptide genes was missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, we didn't expect to be like
the Victorian biosynthesis would be fully
[SPEAKER_00]: abolished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another essay we did was similar to
what Mehan and Murphy did in 47 basically
[SPEAKER_00]: is take the culture filtrate of those
mutants and just use susceptible old
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and just check for disease
symptoms, basically bolting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this test is known to be highly
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all we have is as a possible control,
the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should see bolting syndromes in all
the biological replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a negative control that's a strain
that's Victorian negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are these, shouldn't be any
bolting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for DeltaVicA, what we saw was
that in some replicates, we saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: bolting syndrome and in others we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we interpreted that as sort of the
Victorian prototype production being sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of at the detectable threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was reduced, but not fully
abolished, which sort of made sense to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next strain, or the next Newton
strain that we look at is the DeltaYB
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of those DOF3328 proen
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we couldn't detect Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the toxicity assays, we never
observed bolting syndrome symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we interpreted that is that
probably this GAF gene is also involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cyclization of Victorian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates that 12-moment macro cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that cycle does is protect the
compound from degradation by native
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without the cyclization, the product
would quickly degrade, wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we think we didn't see any
production of any Victorian species in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, we also knocked out
this NADPH oxidized gene, which showed
[SPEAKER_00]: undiminished Victorian production
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not involved in Victorian
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's nice about it is that that gene is
also not in need of the homologous
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit of a validation for
our approach to look at these homologous
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the most interesting
mutant was the knockout of the copperamine
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidase, VicK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we saw there is that, again,
no production of Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't see any toxicity signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned before, Victorian is
actually a mixture of six very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is HV toxin M.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between HV toxin M and
Victorian C is just the N-terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HV toxin M has an unmodified amino
group at the N-terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the glycine here is unmodified,
whereas Victorian C has two hydroxy group
[SPEAKER_00]: at that position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can basically look at HV toxin M as
being the precursor to a Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we then observed was that the
delta VicK mutant could still produce HV
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin M, but none of the other six or none
of the other five are Victorian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these other five Victorian species
all have that double hydroxy group at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we hypothesize that probably the
copperamine oxidase, VicK, is responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for the conversion of this amino group at
the N-terminus into the double hydroxy
[SPEAKER_00]: group, which is of significance because
it's been shown that this double hydroxy
[SPEAKER_00]: group is what gives Victorian a big boost
in its toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So HV toxin M is vastly less toxic or has
less bioactivity compared to Victorian C
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of the other Victorians here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the bottom here is sort of our
proposed reaction done by catalytic
[SPEAKER_00]: generalized by VicK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hypothesized that if knocking
out VicK resulted in HV toxin M not being
[SPEAKER_00]: converted to a Victorian C, then it will
also result in the precursors of Victorian
[SPEAKER_00]: D, B, and E, which all have this double
hydroxy group at the end not being
[SPEAKER_00]: produced and would result in the precursor
of those accumulating in the culture
[SPEAKER_00]: filtrate of the delta VicK mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did tandem mass spectrometry on
that, and that's exactly what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found those precursors to those
Victorian species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick note on the tandem mass spec data
here, because it might not look that
[SPEAKER_00]: convincing to someone like this forest of
fragment masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we opted not to go for NMR
was because NMR needs a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: compound in a pure form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really difficult to obtain
from the VicK strain because it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it wasn't really necessary either
because we didn't want to do de novo
[SPEAKER_00]: structural elucidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we wanted to do was compare very
similar compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, all we needed to confirm
here was that if we compare one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorian species to its precursor,
then we should see mass shifts only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fragments that contain the N-terminus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be D and E, while the
fragments that don't contain the
[SPEAKER_00]: N-terminus should have unchanged masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that's where tandem MS really
shines is just comparing similar
[SPEAKER_00]: structures and comparing those fragment
masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that worked nicely for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then as a final test of VicK's
activity, sort of as a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation, we did an in vitro assay of
the conversion of HV toxin M to a
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see here is basically four
different samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each line is a sample, and then each
column is an extracted achromatogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the left one, 798, corresponds to the
mass of HV toxin M.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right one, 815, to a Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first line is just the Victorian C
standard for comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second line is the substrate that we used
for the assay, HV toxin M.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the substrate has HV toxin
M, doesn't have Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what I should mention is that we
tried to do, we tried to heterologous
[SPEAKER_00]: express VicK and Nicola that don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used an assay that we use in this
lab sometimes is where we heterologously
[SPEAKER_00]: express VicK in Aspergillus, Netherlands,
and instead of purifying the protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just lyse the cells and use cell-free
lysate for our assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we did here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the third line then is the actual
assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cell-free lysate from VicK
producing Aspergillus mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell-free lysate, as you can see right
here, has HV toxin M mass and HV toxin C
[SPEAKER_00]: mass, which is also the HV toxin M mass
after 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the cell-free lysate is also HV
toxin C mass, so that's the HV toxin M
mass.
Now, in the second line is the cell-free
lysate, HV toxin M mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the first line is HV toxin C mass,
which is also HV toxin H, and HV toxin M
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: almost completely disappeared,
which was a little bit baffling in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a follow-up test and basically
just used the empty vector control
[SPEAKER_00]: cell-free lysate in a boiled or unboiled
state and incubated it with either HV
[SPEAKER_00]: toxin M or Victorian C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we could observe was that over
time HV toxin M got consumed, whereas
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorian C remained relatively stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the disappearance of HV toxin M
here then is explained by selective
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of HV toxin M by native
aspergillus nilens enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that was nice, nice confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also worth mentioning that copper mean
oxidases are not known and ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthesis, so that's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned earlier, it's also
really important for turning the Victorian
[SPEAKER_00]: into its most toxic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and those are the results from the
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue working on the project and
there's still many, many unsolved
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, what would be really
interesting is finding out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for the chlorination,
especially since the chlorination takes
[SPEAKER_00]: place on unactivated carbon centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a special kind of chlorination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also interesting would be what enzyme does
the contraction of the phenyl ring here to
[SPEAKER_00]: the five-member ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will also be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to know what all these DF
genes do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be really interesting for
fungal rip biosynthesis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also from a genomic architecture
standpoint, what is the deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: scattering of the big Vick genes with a
clustered originally, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary, what is the origin of the
Vick biosynthetic genes, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no homologs and it's close cousins in
cocaobas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that just leads me to thank a
couple of people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, without Gillian, all of this
wouldn't have worked, not only like in our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration, but also all the work she
did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, Shang Hui did a lot of
work in creating knockout strains and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Megan did the heavy lifting on all the
sequencing and all that from Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: Solomon's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: CMCA did the orbit trap data collection
from our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Kam, who's also involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Heng.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Thomas Wolbert, who was really
nice in providing us the Victorian C
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for tuning in and I'll be
taking questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Simon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm hearing you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions for Simon?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question was going to be,
what is responsible for the chlorination
[SPEAKER_04]: step?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we knew that, that would
probably be another publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the genes we have identified as
candidates, there's no really obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe actually one of those DOF genes
might be involved there because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many and they got to do something,
at least some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there's no obvious smoking gun
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a question in the chat from Asina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Missed the connection in the introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Victorin was originally thought to be
an NRPS?
[SPEAKER_04]: What made people start to think about the
possibility of RIP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so NRPS is just by the unusual amino
acids that are in the structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: Victorin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an NRPS biosynthesis, there's
potential for modification of or the
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporation of unusual amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why people first jumped to the
conclusion that this might be
[SPEAKER_00]: non-rivozomally produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other question was, how did we get
the idea that it might be a RIP?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, one of the really rare
features in fungal RIPs is this ethyl bond
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really unusual in fungal
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember in 2017, there was a big
review on fungal cyclic peptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they classified all of the peptides by
their chemical makeup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they classified basically cyclic
peptides that had an ethyl bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them were fungal RIPs,
except for Victorin, which is said was an
[SPEAKER_00]: NRPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I started sweating a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, this maybe gives other people
the idea too, because at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had started our collaboration already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Maria Harrison with her hand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: A really interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned a far away P450.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the orange gene in a cluster
somewhere, and it was far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that one turn out to be part of the
production of Victorin?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't assayed that one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be really interesting to see
because it's one of the more unusual
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't gotten around to knocking
that one out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also trying to do to
heterologously reconstruct the Victorin
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway, which has turned out to be really
difficult as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're certainly interested in
that, and we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sort of conspicuous that it is
on the same contact as at least part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Victorin genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I searched for homologs in the Victorin
genome and in other genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually a rare find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it actually just by accident
happened to be next to the college tricum
[SPEAKER_00]: cluster as well as on the same contact as
the Victorin genes, that will be bad luck
[SPEAKER_00]: basically for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Claire Castile has a question in the chat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are any known plant rips also involved in
plant defense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert on plant rips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know fungal rips.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fair to say that we know very
little about function of any of these rip
[SPEAKER_04]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we have genome sequence,
we can easily pick out NRPSs and
[SPEAKER_04]: polyketides, sinthases, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very difficult unless you start
with a molecule as was done for Victorin.
[SPEAKER_04]: To actually screen genomes for these
molecules, much less test function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I understand, I think in plants
also you don't have these convenient gene
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's even more difficult there to do
the reverse sort of search from the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule to producing cluster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions for Simon?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody, many of us are grateful for you
staying up so late.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the invitation and thanks for
tuning in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your terrific work.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
