[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so today I'm going to be
talking to you about two different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about things
happening in the flower and things
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that hasn't made it onto our website
yet, but we've been thinking about root
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs a lot in the past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first I want to talk, so what you'll
notice is when I have a flower up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that means I'm talking about reflection
and when there's a root I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: below ground stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first lab is communication and plant
reproduction, and probably I don't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell most of you here, but what happens is
we have pollen lands on a stigma,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's communication between the pollen
and the papilla cell, if it's a compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction a tip growing pollen tube will
grow, and then it needs to make its way to
[SPEAKER_00]: the ovules which contain the female
gametophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during this process there's a lot of
intercellular communication occurring as
[SPEAKER_00]: this pollen tube encounters various
different cell types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's six or seven different types
of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pollen, its whole purpose in life,
is to carry the two sperm cells to the
[SPEAKER_00]: female gametophyte so that double
fertilization can occur to make the embryo
[SPEAKER_00]: and the endosperm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the female gametophyte also has these
specialized cells called synergids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and synergids are my favorite cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're haploid cells, they're not
gametes, but they're in charge of telling
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen tube what to do when it reaches
its target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we basically have two highly
polarized cells that need to talk to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other during pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have tip growing pollen tubes
that grow by adding material new cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: material and new membrane only to the tip
so they don't get wider but they get
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then inside ovules we have these
synergid cells that are also highly
[SPEAKER_00]: polarized cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see here the two synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the egg and the central cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these synergids have a highly
specialized region called the filiform
[SPEAKER_00]: apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this filiform apparatus, so this is a
scanning block-based SEM through an ovule
[SPEAKER_00]: showing the two synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the egg, central cells back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see there's dark material here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a membrane-rich region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we segment this, we can see that it
looks like fingers that project up into
[SPEAKER_00]: the cytoplasm of the synergid cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where all the action takes
place in the communication between the
[SPEAKER_00]: synergid cell and the arriving pollen
tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that communication is very
important from some studies that were done
[SPEAKER_00]: by Higashiyama and Hamamura back in 2008,
where they took an ovule of ternia and
[SPEAKER_00]: placed it on pollen tube growth media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they germinated and they had a
pistol over there and let pollen tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the scientist is doing is moving
the ovule away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I hope you can notice is the
pollen tube is following the ovule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that the ovule,
specifically these two synergid cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: are emitting molecules that then the
pollen tube has a receptor for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pollen tube can change its growth
direction in response to signals from the
[SPEAKER_00]: female gametophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higashiyama's lab identified these
signals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually small, cysteine-rich
peptides that they named LERS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pollen tube receptors for
these LERS are also there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's first indication that synergids
are really important for telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen tube what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, in this study, this was done in
Ule Grostenklaas' lab by Queen Yeo,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was another postdoc when I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have here are two synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is expressing calcium reporters,
and then we have a arriving pollen tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a minute timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you can see, and red means high
calcium, blue is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the pollen tube starts to talk to the
synergids, we get these calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations happening in the two synergid
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, calcium levels increase greatly in
the tip of the pollen tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, after about 40 minutes,
the pollen tube then starts to grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets up near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first, to release the sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second synergid stays alive,
and it acts as a backup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can attract a second pollen tube by
sending out LERS again to get another
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen tube to come if the two sperm cells
from the first one can't fuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the same process can repeat
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, a group in China showed if
both tries don't work, then the central
[SPEAKER_00]: cell can also send out a signal and
attract another pollen tube to try yet
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant really wants pollination
double realization to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was a postdoc in the
Grosniklaas' lab, we were taking a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to try to understand the
molecular recognition of pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: synergid communication, which we call
pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so mutants on the female side that
disrupt this process, they can still
[SPEAKER_00]: attract a pollen tube, but the pollen tube
doesn't burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't get the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK to release the sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it keeps growing around and
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first mutant discovered was
veronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this encodes a receptor like kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expressed in synergids, but it's also
expressed throughout the plant in most
[SPEAKER_00]: cells, except for veronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called veronia.
And veronia is a phenotype of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But its gametophytic phenotype is that if
you have a heterozygous veronia mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: half of the ovules will remain
unfertilized because the pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't get the signal to burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a postdoc, I was working on a
second mutant, which we named Nordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are named after Etruscan goddesses
of fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Uli, not me naming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar phenotype, pollen tube
overgrowth, pollen tube doesn't get the
[SPEAKER_00]: signal to burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ovules, the pollen tube can burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not an all or none like the
veronia phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we see lower levels of infertility
than in veronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also shown in Uli's lab, in his
study, that those calcium oscillations,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you quantify them, we can see in wild
type, we can see in both the receptive
[SPEAKER_00]: synergid and the non-wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: In non-receptive synergids, we have these
calcium oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have it in the pollen tube as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the pollen tube burst,
we see the pollen tube's dead now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the receptive synergid will
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other synergid stays alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In veronia mutants, those oscillations
don't occur at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either the receptive or non-receptive
synergid will die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Nordia mutants, they occur,
but they're at a lower amplitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea was that the reason why Nordia
mutants are an all or none phenotype is
[SPEAKER_00]: that sometimes, stochastically,
you get enough calcium oscillation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then the pollen tube gets triggered to
burst.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from all this and from work that
several labs have done, there's a model
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have veronia and a GPI anchored
protein called Lorelei that are found at
[SPEAKER_00]: this filiform apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they act as a co-receptor for Ralph
peptides from the arriving pollen tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this co-receptor then triggers a
signal transduction cascade, which leads
[SPEAKER_00]: to calcium oscillations in the synergid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to talk a little bit
more about this Nordia NTA and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to it during this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does Nordia control the amplitude
of synergid calcium oscillations?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nordia is actually an MLO protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stands for mildew resistance locus O.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Arabidopsis genome has 15 members of
this family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them are predicted to have
seven transmembrane domains and a big
[SPEAKER_00]: extracellular loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two cysteines that make a
predicted disulfide bond here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this cysteine and this cysteine
make another disulfide bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the C terminal tail, there's a
calmodulin binding domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: MLO proteins have been popping up a lot
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were originally discovered in the
context of powdery mildew infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were discovered in barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a barley MLO mutant,
the plant becomes completely resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, it was found that clade 5 MLOs and
Arabidopsis play the same role.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a triple mutant becomes completely
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Single mutants have lesser degrees of
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nordia is involved in pollen tube
reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another four MLOs,
1, 5, 9, and 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock all of them out, the pollen
tubes burst early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't maintain their integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MLO disease phenotypes are conserved
across monocots and dicots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, any plant that gets infected
by powdery mildew you can find the right
[SPEAKER_00]: MLO and knock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant becomes resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that we don't know what
those MLOs are actually doing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the powdery mildew takes advantage of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also showed back when I was a postdoc
in collaboration with Ralph Pinstruga's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab that ferronia mutants, so the receptor
mutants, are also resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gave us this idea that there's
conserved pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have powdery mildew or tipcroft
growing cell that must communicate with
[SPEAKER_00]: and penetrate, make an interaction with a
plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen tubes are also tip-growing cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must communicate with the female
gametophyte to deliver the sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in both cases, it was shown that MLO
proteins actually accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they become polarly localized to the
site of tip-growing cell communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nordia also does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before pollen tube arrival,
Nordia is localized in the Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a pollen tube arrives,
they're signaling that moves it to that
[SPEAKER_00]: filiform apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are synergid cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before a pollen tube arrives, we see these
punctate pattern with complete overlap
[SPEAKER_00]: with Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when a pollen tube arrives,
we can see this starts to accumulate at
[SPEAKER_00]: that filiform apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to take a closer look at this
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we used was a semi-in vivo pollen
tube guidance and reception assay that had
[SPEAKER_00]: been developed by Leonor Bobita and Ravi
Panabalu and several other groups in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plate reproduction field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that you can germinate
pollen on media, and it'll make a pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those pollen tubes can't be attracted
to ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to do is to apply pollen
to a stigma, give it a few hours to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: through, and then we cut the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put it on media and arrange ovules
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can follow what happens to the
pollen tubes and what happens to our
[SPEAKER_00]: Nordia protein during pollen tube
reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a live movie of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you watch this ovule right here,
we can see when the pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, we see a shift in the
geophysics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't know if that was a cause or
a consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jing, my former PhD student,
did a lot of live imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a DS red labeled pollen tube,
and then we have Nordia GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you can be convinced that we
see a shift in the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at time here, and we see that
this actually starts to happen as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen tube makes contact,
arrives at the synergist.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we wanted to test whether
this was required or pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took advantage of an earlier
study we had done where we expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: different MLOs under synergist-specific
promoters to see if they could complement
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nordia phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came upon one of the MLOs,
MLO1, that actually constitutively goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the one expressed in synergists.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does not complement the Nordia
phenotype, but we thought we could take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of this to try to do some domain
swaps to manipulate Nordia accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should also mention in epidermal
cells, so this is in tobacco transient
[SPEAKER_00]: expression, Nordia goes to Golgi,
and MLO1 goes to the C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a bunch of domain swaps,
and we found that the C terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic tail was sufficient to make a
Nordia chimeric protein accumulate mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: at the filiform apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tested whether this could
complement the Nordia mutant phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it complements just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show a lot of these
graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have percent unfertilized ovules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it will be percent ovules with
pollen tube overgrowth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see in Nordia in this
experiment, it was about 40-some percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our Nordia MLO1 was able to
complement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant it wasn't dangerous to have
it there early.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hypothesis was maybe it's poisonous
and it needs to stay out of that region
[SPEAKER_00]: until it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That did not seem to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also knew that Ferronia itself is
required for this trafficking of Nordia to
[SPEAKER_00]: the filiform apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Ferronia mutants, Nordia stays in
the Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't go to the C.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the obvious question was, can we take
our constitutively filiform apparatus
[SPEAKER_00]: localized Nordia, which we now call FA
Nordia, could that complement the Ferronia
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's FA Nordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is regular Nordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put it in a Ferronia background,
which has 80% to 90% infertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see we start to see seeds
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can quantify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ferronia here, this is a homozygous
Ferronia mutant with 80% infertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can complement the phenotype to about
half using our F.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also check pollen tube
overgrowth is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually bypass a very important
signal transduction pathway by just moving
[SPEAKER_00]: a protein to the place in the cell where
it needs to do its action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we showed that Ferronia is not
necessary for Nordia to perform its
[SPEAKER_00]: function or the MLO to perform its
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we still didn't know
what MLOs did molecularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we came up with what we called our
booster signal hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that Ferronia was absolutely
required to give a signal that would lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to pollen tube bursting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it causes trafficking of Nordia
to this filiform apparatus, which then
[SPEAKER_00]: helps to boost the signal to make sure
that the pollen tubes burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we take out Ferronia and just have a
Nordia mutant or just have Nordia filiform
[SPEAKER_00]: apparatus, the FA Nordia, it's able to do
it, do the function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was our booster signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow, we also think that Ferronia,
either by increasing calcium, leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: this trafficking, or it's directly somehow
intersecting and causing Nordia
[SPEAKER_00]: trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, what are signals x
and y from Ferronia and Nordia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the same molecule?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this, we went back to,
we and others went back to this
[SPEAKER_00]: observation that in Nordia mutants,
the calcium oscillations occur at lower
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Shang Luan's group in 2022 tested the
hypothesis that maybe MLOs are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they took all 15 Arabidopsis MLOs,
expressed them in COS7 animal cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found some of them could conduct
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Nordia couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And MLO1 couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they took advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they took a closer look at where
these proteins were going.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going in the COS7 cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nordia GFP actually looks in a pattern
very similar to Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they co-expressed with Ferronia and
Lorelai, the protein would go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they used our FA Nordia construct,
the protein would start to also appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tested whether the plasma
membrane localization of Nordia or FA
[SPEAKER_00]: Nordia would lead to calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intake into the cells and indeed it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conclusion was MLOs or maybe
calcium channels, they need to be a plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane to do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know Nordia X downstream of
Ferronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regulates calcium influx into the
synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question we're trying to answer in
my lab is how do those calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations in the synergids lead to
pollen tube rupture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really hard question to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think it might actually be related
to not what's going on in this cell and
[SPEAKER_00]: this cell, but what's actually going on
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we're depleting calcium outside
the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's allowing cell wall changes to
occur that are then going to let that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen tube burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to change gears a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many people in this room had heard
of Ferronia before I mentioned it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty famous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its first publication was that it's
involved in pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it's been implicated in a
lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So immunity, not just the powdery mildew,
but also bacterial immunity, cell growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress responses, morphogenesis,
cell wall mechanical integrity has been
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed to be a cell wall sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made a hypothesis that maybe
there was a conserved signaling module
[SPEAKER_00]: where Ferronia activates an MLO
downstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this helps cells to communicate with
their external environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we took our FANordia
GFP, which is a gain of function channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we expressed it this time with the
Ferronia promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be expressed everywhere where
Ferronia would be expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with the 35S strong promoter that
would be active in sporadic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we tested what phenotypes of
Ferronia could we complement with
[SPEAKER_00]: FANordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so first we looked at just our pollen
tube reception phenotype that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: studied using a synergistic specific
promoter of MID98.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that both the Ferronia
promoter driven FANordia could complement
[SPEAKER_00]: at about the same level as MID98.
[SPEAKER_00]: But surprisingly, the 35S promoter
construct could complement completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lore had been that 35S is not
expressed in immunophytic cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually is sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the time it's a positional effect,
but 35S can be active in spirages.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second phenotype that we tested,
so it had been shown that when pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes leave the transmitting tract,
usually only one leaves at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a Ferronia-mediated gating
mechanism here that sort of opens the
[SPEAKER_00]: gate, lets one pollen tube out,
and then recloses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the phenotype in Ferronia plants is
that more than one pollen tube will leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the transmitting tract at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is getting cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, this was with an interspecific
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also happens with conspecific crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or FANordia could also complement that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just having an activated MLO channel is
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interspecific crosses, so if you cross a
rabidopsis that is a polyana with a
[SPEAKER_00]: rabidopsis lyroda, one phenotype is,
so pollen can germinate on a stigma,
[SPEAKER_00]: send a pollen tube through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a lot of ovules, the pollen tube
doesn't get the same inverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we express FANordia, or if we
overexpress Nordia itself, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: improve interspecific pollen tube bursting
in these interspecific crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, in a Ferronia background,
this doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need Ferronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: For FANordia to be able to do its job in
these interspecific crosses, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: still in the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, a lot of people have looked at
Ferronia root phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ferronia roots actually are longer than
wild type roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all in a rabidopsis polyana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more striking phenotype is that
Ferronia root hairs are stunted and they
[SPEAKER_00]: often burst early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't maintain their tip
integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That phenotype is completely complemented
by expressing FANordia with either the 35S
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter or with the Ferronia promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only showing the 35S thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, this looks bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a closer look at Ferronia root
hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was that not only do they
burst early, they tend to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: triangular shaped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we also sometimes see spherical
root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've completely lost their polarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those phenotypes can all be
complemented by having our FANordia
[SPEAKER_00]: construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if we add FANordia, the root hairs
become less triangular in shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is measuring tip width over base
width.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see we go back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, another phenotype of Ferronia is
that the plants are dwarfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that phenotype could not be
complemented by either Ferronia-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: FANordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this, we conclude that some,
but not all, Ferronia phenotypes can be
[SPEAKER_00]: complemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pollen tube overgrowth, polytube from
the septum, primary root length,
[SPEAKER_00]: abnormal root hair growth, but
interspecific pollen tube reception and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative morphism cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think is this with army knife
Ferronia, some of the things it does need
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium downstream, and some don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ones that need calcium,
we can bypass with an MLO.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about calcium?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told you MLOs are thought to be
calcium channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know from lots of groups work that
there's a tip focused calcium gradient
[SPEAKER_00]: that's established after root hair
initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's linked to polarized root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you earlier that we have this
calcium gradient or calcium oscillations
[SPEAKER_00]: that occur in synergists upon pollen tube
arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this is also linked to being able
to have a pollen tube that bursts and
[SPEAKER_00]: releases its firm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to take a look at what
happens to calcium in Ferronia and
[SPEAKER_00]: FANordia root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this, we used an ARC ECHO marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we had it in the lab,
we understand that chameleon is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we used light sheet imaging to capture
images every three seconds for 12 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: from growing root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measured what was happening
with calcium at the tip of the root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the light sheet system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us to do sort of 3D imaging
in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to need to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Columbia, you can see these calcium
oscillations in root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ferronia, we can see round spherical
root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some root hairs trying to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these flashes are root hairs
actually bursting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we add FANordia back in,
we now recover tip growth and we see
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillations occurring again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also quantified this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm sorry about the quality of
that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see is in Columbia,
if we just look at the oscillations,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is from one example, versus Ferronia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in Ferronia, they get very erratic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spherical root hairs, we see very
little calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we add back in 35 SFANordia,
we can restore the calcium oscillations
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much to normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we're complementing Ferronia root
hair phenotypes by restoring the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to do calcium oscillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that FANordia is a synthetic fusion
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then ask the question, is there an
MLO involved in regulating root hair
[SPEAKER_00]: growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we looked at some
single cell data publicly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that MLO 15 is really
specific to root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can zoom in right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green is high expression here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at reporters,
we can see strong expression of MLO 15 at
[SPEAKER_00]: the tips of root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we get an MLO 15 mutant,
we see dwarfed root hairs, a phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: that's similar to Ferronia, but a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we looked at root hair growth in
Columbia versus MLO 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, number of root hairs doesn't
really change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see final length is much shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we just measure root hairs along a
root from the tip up to the hypocotyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get a faux growth curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see pink here is Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is MLO 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our MLO 15 GFP can complement and
maybe even get longer root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can also show that MLO 15 root
hairs, shown here in blue, grow at roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: half the rate of wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very similar to Ferronia
mutant root hairs that are still
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, run out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question is, does MLO 15 subcellular
localization change during different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of root hair growth, like we see
with Nordea?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's some light sheet with MLO 15
GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see it's very tip localized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look more closely, we can see it's
not there yet during root hair initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes on once the bulge starts
to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it seems to be being trafficked
down to the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see if we look at old root hairs
that have already stopped growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be that the GFP signal gets
sequestered, maybe in the Golgi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that once the growth is no
longer needed, you don't need MLO to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there at the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it gets endocytosed.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so last question, does MLO 15 also
affect calcium dynamics in root hairs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the same experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used Columbia, MLO 15, and then a 35S
MLO 15 construct that complemented the MLO
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 mutant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just roughly at first, we could see,
OK, MLO 15 root hairs seem to have dimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not a ratio metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked also at patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in wild type, we see a frequency
that's at this about 0.04 in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's every 25 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 35S MLO 15, this gets completely
deregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got peaks all over these
different frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we recover it back to almost the
same frequency and express it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this, we made a model that somehow
during root hair tip growth, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have feronia acting to control what's
happening and maintaining tip integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably there's other calcium channels
also involved in setting up calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: gradients that's been shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several CNGC channels are involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe the MLOs, again,
are in the boost that signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've also got some data I'm not
going to talk about, but that we can also
[SPEAKER_00]: recover reactive oxygen species
accumulation in root hairs by just adding
[SPEAKER_00]: in an F8 mordia construct.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so to conclude, we have signal
mediated trafficking of the MLO protein
[SPEAKER_00]: mordia from the Golgi to the filiform
apparatus during pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: This increases calcium transport into
synergids and mediates signaling that
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to proper communication and pollen
tube rupture to release the sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feronia signaling is required for mordia
trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But F8 mordia can bypass feronia in both
synergids and in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we've discovered a new
function for an MLO.
[SPEAKER_00]: MLO 15 in tip growth in root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to leave you with a couple
of thoughts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of minutes,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we think is maybe these MLOs are
kind of acting like the volume knob on an
[SPEAKER_00]: old fashioned radio, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you set your AM or FM band,
and then you tune into a station,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's maybe what feronia is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's helping to tune it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have these MLOs that are then
able to turn up the volume so that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper response happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you want to do this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially in pollination and
reception, you want to make sure that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the right pollen tube,
you want to really ensure that it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so synergids, before a pollen tube
arrives, they're lure factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pumping out these attractants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the pollen tube arrives,
they need to stop the trafficking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to switch to reception mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could imagine if you don't have
the right ligands, the Ralphs,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to trigger feronia,
then the ovule doesn't want to waste time
[SPEAKER_00]: on that pollen tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if it has the right ligands,
it wants to make sure that that pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: tube will deliver its sperm cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's part of this signal
mediated traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep it at a level where we can
kind of trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then once it gets triggered,
we really want to make sure it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe in the interspecific crosses,
what's happening that's causing pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: tube overgrowth is that there's just not
quite enough triggering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't reach the threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the epimortia do its job.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root hairs, similar deal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep a balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much calcium is as bad as too little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe modulating these MLOs helps to
sort of keep things moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to leave you with one more thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are actually 17 feronia-like
genes in Herbidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most species, these are big gene
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 15 MLOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of these now have functions assigned
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: MLOs were working on filling out what
functions are for all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting to think
about, especially with mite reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so far, seven feronia-like genes have
been implicated in places like the stigma,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen tube tip growth, in the
transmitting tract, and at pollen tube
[SPEAKER_00]: reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four MLOs have been implicated on the
pollen tube side, so with pollen tube tip
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also think there's more MLOs
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a really interesting
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I list some of the genes that
have been found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you're thinking about any
process where cells are talking to their
[SPEAKER_00]: external environment, often there's
calcium involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think having this ability to work on
the volume knob maybe has great advantages
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank the main
people who did this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jing and Yan did the early work with
the live imaging of pollen tube reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yan did all the ephanortia and synergids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Sienna did all the root hair
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had never worked on roots in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: She figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went to Chris Diger's lab,
learned how to use the light sheet and
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's finishing her PhD this spring
and was slow to look for potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody who wants a really great
postdoc, Sienna's your girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Somia is a new student in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's working on ephanortia
trafficking and trying to understand how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's working within synergists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd also like to acknowledge the
National Science Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I can take any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering if you're willing to share
how your thinking is emerging on the
[SPEAKER_05]: functional need for oscillations and the
mechanistic basis for oscillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just talking about this with
Maria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, is it a red herring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in pollen tube reception,
if you damp down those oscillations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen tube doesn't burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, we're now starting to
lean more to what's happening outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: cell than what's inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think the field really knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do know in Pharaona, we do see
these really aberrant oscillations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very bad for the root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: It correlates with bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the oscillations function like a
thermostat?
[SPEAKER_04]: That the oscillation itself isn't so
important, but you're trying to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain amplitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do the oscillations
function like a thermostat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mark Johnson's lab at Brown
University, they did a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: interspecific crosses looking at some of
these oscillations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synergies and oscillation patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them, the pollen tubes could
make it when they don't burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't see any correlation between
frequency or amplitude and the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive the pollen tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know they need to happen,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all thought, oh, this is going to be
the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a good mystery.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about the bursting mechanism,
I can imagine that you could be that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get perturbed cellular deposition growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so pressure blows it open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it could be cellular degrading enzymes
from the EHA cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any ideas to how that
operates?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think that there's a similar
Boronia-like RLK Ralph stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's autocrine, paracrine signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people think, OK, that gets
disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's weird to me is the pollen tube
drives up, stops, and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it doesn't just burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows again and then bursts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're still intact enough to
allow that last growth phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear your opinions on cell
wall, personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, it could be that
degrading enzymes are activated somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens to the filiform membrane?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this burst open too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the filiform apparatus, the Gresnikos
lab has showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an invaginative membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the pollen tube grows in,
it expands like a glove, like a balloon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like sticking your hand in the glove.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of it could be you need to change
calcium there so that it actually can
[SPEAKER_00]: loosen somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's little bits of cell wall
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely covered with cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, old literature said it entered this
energy and then burst.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has anybody looked at pH dynamics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you've got a drop in pH in a
very localized way, that expands and
[SPEAKER_01]: suddenly you're active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of anyone doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried some in vitro stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to put the extracellular pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be a way of achieving extremely
localized, very rapid, more listening at
[SPEAKER_01]: that spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to wonder about calcium in that
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So calcium comes from the cell wall,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of wonder whether calcium
dynamic at the tip in depletion from the
[SPEAKER_03]: cell wall can contribute to the burst or
activity of the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one hypothesis is pectin
cross-linking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of pectin in the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're depleting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it would be enough to
deplete and then cause changes in the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that how MLOs got co-opted for
pathogenesis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how would that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're modulators?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like it's great because it's not
like a resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a susceptibility factor, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if MLOs were there during
monitoring of cell integrity and things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have veronias, veronia-related
monitoring cell wall integrity,
[SPEAKER_00]: then bringing in backup MLO to turn up the
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe somehow that you could imagine
that somehow crossed over to pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to take advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing how ethionortia
complements most of the veronia defects or
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see any negative trade-offs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Margaret's question is, are there
negative trade-offs of over-expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: this ethionortia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants look completely normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done all kinds of measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosette size is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything looks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do have differential responses to
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So salt and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're collaborating with a physiologist in
our department to do a bunch of water
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the plants are primed to be able
to respond to certain stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is going to mess up the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're deregulating calcium and it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just shows you that there's a lot of
compensation that can occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the stress topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your slide, you mentioned that
veronia somehow medullates heavy metal
[SPEAKER_03]: stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of wonder with regard to
root hair growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So iron deficiency causes root hair
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of wonder what your thoughts
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is veronia medullating anything normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not tested it, but we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think veronia is a weird one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, labs have done
transcriptomic stuff, pull-downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any interactor you look at, you can find a
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely, there's some stuff with
translation and messenger RNA processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that stuff is going to be
complemented with MLO with that being
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's some stuff in the
literature I'm not sure about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very easy for us to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have an open postdoc position for
at least a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone's interested, please let me
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you check online if there are any
questions over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Sharon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
