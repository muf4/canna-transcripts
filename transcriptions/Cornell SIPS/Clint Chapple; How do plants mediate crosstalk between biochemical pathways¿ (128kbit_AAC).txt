[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the students out there,
you are always practicing your seminars
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's for moments like this when
you have to do performance under pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: when about six of your slides got chewed
up by the PC or my flash drive or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do my best to fill in
those gaps, but hopefully they won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: too serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well the first thing I want to
do is to thank people who did the work
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end, but people who funded the
work, long-standing funding to my lab from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Energy, both to my lab
and then through this EFRC that we have at
[SPEAKER_00]: Purdue called C3Bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some post-doctoral support fell by Nick
Bonowitz from the LSRF, and we've also had
[SPEAKER_00]: funding from GCEP, a funding agency
through Stanford, NSF, and our
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborator John Ralph in the GLBRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to talk to you about today
is what I think is just testimony to how
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate I am that we did a mutant screen
many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discussed the first of the mutants that
came out of that screen when I interviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: at Weiss Thompson in 1993.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the job at Purdue, though,
which is where I met my wife, so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything worked out just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a mutant screen that we started,
and it took us down the road of enzymes of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylpropionate and lignin biosynthesis,
but more recently with this screen we
[SPEAKER_00]: identified an important regulatory
component, part of the mediator complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why I sort of have this oblique
pun in here about mediate, that turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: to, the function of which turns out to
explain a number of the unexpected
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes we saw in our biochemical
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little bit weaving
and crossing over that I hope I can walk
[SPEAKER_00]: you through all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, why are we interested in
studying phenylpropionate metabolism?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a long interest in secondary
metabolism, why plants make all the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabulous compounds that they make,
but phenylpropionate metabolism was one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's particularly important both
biologically and in terms of the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass for humans, for bioenergy or
animal feed, or even for paper production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for plants, it was one of the
important innovations that permitted the
[SPEAKER_00]: colonization of land because it involves
the generation of molecules that can
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb UV light that the plants now have
to deal with if they're on land compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to living in an aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens to be the molecule that's
going to feature prominently in this talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the UV protective molecule that
rapidopsis makes called synapoyl malate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's of course this portion of the
molecule on the right that is responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for absorbing UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I show this portion of
the name in blue is that the great feature
[SPEAKER_00]: about this for us is that this moiety
makes this molecule fluorescent under UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a mutant phenotype, the presence or
absence of this fluorescence has been very
[SPEAKER_00]: useful to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other important component that is
derived from this pathway is lignin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is sort of a schematic
representation of what lignin might look
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't have a very good
understanding of the actual structural,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we know the structural motifs,
but not exactly how it exists in the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course this molecule, I like to
describe it as being important at both the
[SPEAKER_00]: macroscopic and microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lignin polymer is impregnated into
the cell wall where it gives it rigidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and allows these trees to stand upright
and withstand the forces of wind and what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the microscopic level, it's also
important as a molecule that strengthens
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell walls of the water-conducting
tissue, the xylem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a cross-section of a rabidopsis
stem, and you can see the tracheary
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that are nice and big and open
and good for conducting water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this mutant that has lower levels
of lignin, those same cells have collapsed
[SPEAKER_00]: under the tension, of course, that's
developed by transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't want to leave you with the
impression that lignin's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: important strengthening agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cellulose deficient mutant will show a
similar phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's clearly a codependent network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyhow, it's pretty clear that this
pathway is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for, many of you probably aren't
lignin experts but have heard a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: it with regard to biomass and biofuel
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the reasons I would argue is
that it represents low-hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique polymer in that,
let's go through the other ones that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all familiar with in plants or in
organisms, nucleic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that their synthesis is template
dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein synthesis, we're reading an mRNA
template to make a protein molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Polysaccharides, well, that's a little bit
different, but still there are specific
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes that make specific linkages to
make very characteristic polysaccharides
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lignin synthesis is entirely different in
that it's the types of cross-links that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see in the lignin polymer and the
components that make it up are dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: only upon the precursor supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever so-called monolignols that a
plant makes, whatever ratio the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them in, is represented in what the
polymer is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's just contrast that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you made a, had a yeast cell that
overproduced leucine, you would never
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to see its proteins containing more
leucine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here we can, we have found,
and I'll show you some of the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really data, pictures that we have
that show that we can manipulate
[SPEAKER_00]: monolignal synthesis and thereby
manipulate lignin both chemistry and,
[SPEAKER_00]: it turns out, architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lignin monolignal biosynthesis begins
in the cytoplasm with amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylalanine, and there's a series of
hydroxylation and methylation reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: that lead to these three alcohols,
pericumeral alcohol, coniferal alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cynical alcohol, so-called H,
G, and S subunits for lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that what we're talking
about is differences in the decoration of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ring, so this is the earliest branch
off the pathway, the second one and the
[SPEAKER_00]: third one, and I'll show this slightly
differently in some upcoming slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these molecules can then be exported to
the apoplast where they're activated to
[SPEAKER_00]: free radicals by lacases and peroxidases,
which then spontaneously polymerize to
[SPEAKER_00]: form the polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending upon what monolignols are
made, that determines what comes out and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is polymerized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a representation of the pathway
that probably is sufficient for most
[SPEAKER_00]: people's purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you I know the structures
involved, but if I showed them all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't be able to see them and you
wouldn't remember them anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, maybe it's teaching 20
years of undergraduate biochemistry that's
[SPEAKER_00]: driven me to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my schematic of the pathway,
and it again starts with phenylalanine and
[SPEAKER_00]: give branches to give the G subunit
kinethyl alcohol or the S subunit cynical
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show this because this molecule
I mentioned earlier is a derivative of
[SPEAKER_00]: this same pathway, so cynical malate comes
off of the pathway fairly late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by looking for mutants that are
deficient or reduced in cynical malate
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation, we have been able to
identify enzymes, genes and enzymes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not only required for these final
transformations, but also a number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: steps that are common to both cynical
malate biosynthesis and lignin
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I go through my talk,
I'll often use the accumulation of cynical
[SPEAKER_00]: malate basically as a proxy for overall
activity of this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, cynical malate is
fluorescent blue under UV light,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can actually see that in planta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is a wild type plant
photograph just with a trans-illuminator
[SPEAKER_00]: for illumination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first mutant we identified that we
called pha-1 for ferulic acid hydroxylase
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it completely lacks cynical
malate, and you can see it has this nice
[SPEAKER_00]: red fluorescence that comes about because,
well, first, there's no blue fluorescence
[SPEAKER_00]: from cynical malate, but also because
cynical malate is an effective UV
[SPEAKER_00]: sunscreen, in its absence, that UV can
penetrate down into the mesophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: excite chlorophyll molecules, and you see
chlorophyll fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to take this photograph
again with a yellow filter over the lens
[SPEAKER_00]: that would block out this blue
fluorescence, what you would see here is a
[SPEAKER_00]: red plant and a plant that's basically
just dark because this is an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blocks UV from getting into the
mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk to you about
today is a number of these mutants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the later ones of which we refer to as REF
for reduced epidermal fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that we can manipulate
lignin biosynthesis, and I mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: partially in terms of the justification
for the research, but also it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: for what's going to come later in my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is very old work, so I'm just
going to mention it very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we eliminate F5H, ferulite
5-hydroxylase, in the pha-1 mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the first time that we have shown
that we could do this lignin manipulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the absence of that enzyme,
the lignin is derived entirely from G
[SPEAKER_00]: subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect on the plant is essentially
there is no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants grow and develop normally,
and that's perhaps not surprising because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look outside, pine trees,
gymnosperms, make only this G lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already know that's an effective
polymer in some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these Arabidopsis plants are fine
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we've also found that if you
overexpress this step, we can redirect
[SPEAKER_00]: flux over to make a pure S lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it has no effect on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a functional lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite interesting because it's easier
to degrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually has, instead of being a
cross-linked polymer, it's a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really dramatically changing the
cell wall structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's tolerated very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have another example of a mutant
that is very early in the pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: C3'H.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we block that step, the plants
make a lignin that is derived from these H
[SPEAKER_00]: subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: These subunits make up normally about 1%
of the polymer in wild-type plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lignin in these plants is almost
entirely derived from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has very severe consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were not maybe entirely
surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the lignin literature, it was said that
you couldn't even make H lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought, well, this is probably
not a functional polymer for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that these plants are dwarf,
perhaps it's got to do with, and I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: use the same slide as I used earlier,
this idea that the abundance of lignin is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants make very little H lignin and
also show this vascular collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know, obviously, that water
transport is very important to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a plant that can't transport water is
dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a terribly big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in many cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the xylem has predominantly G lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's both in Arabidopsis and also in
tree species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas supporting tissues, fibers,
as clarified, cells deposit S lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, especially in the case of
those cells, it's when I say S lignin,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really a Gs copolymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to set that mutant down for a
moment and talk about another of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants that we worked on, that we've
worked on, called REF4.
[SPEAKER_00]: This turns out to be the regulatory
protein that I mentioned at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although when we first identified it,
we didn't understand that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So REF4 mutants also deposit less lignin
than wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting used to seeing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can see that in the strong allele,
we have collapsed xylem compared to these
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have about a 25% reduction in
overall lignin content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's highly consistent with the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the extent to which you can
reduce lignin before you start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are also dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the strong allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once, of course, we had cloned the
gene, we could identify knockouts for this
[SPEAKER_00]: to see whether they would recapitulate
this mutant phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a knockout for REF4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a missense mutation that
is semi-dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't really a huge surprise that
the knockout didn't recapitulate that
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: REF4 has a paralog in the Arabidopsis
genome that we call REF4-related 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: or RFR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: A knockout of this also doesn't phenocopy
REF4-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the double knockout also does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certainly something special
about this particular mutant allele with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very minor change in the protein
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a glycine to serine alteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it appears is that that mutation
causes that protein to act as a
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutive break on phenylpropionate
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very relieved, in fact,
to find that the knockouts, or the double
[SPEAKER_00]: knockout particularly, gives the opposite
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is using, again, synapomalate levels
as a measure of phenylpropionate activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knock out REF4, there's really no
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You knock out RFR1, you do get an
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the double knockout has an even more
substantial increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that this is a great relief
because the fact that this gives the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite phenotype to this suggests that
this is not a neomorphic mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a protein that's
acting in the same pathway it normally
[SPEAKER_00]: acts in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, for the students, if you've not
thought about this before, if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about a neomorphic mutation, what about a
transcription factor that has a missense
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation that leads to a change in the
amino acids on the DNA binding domain that
[SPEAKER_00]: now allow it to bind somewhere where it
wouldn't normally bind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you start studying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're studying a context for that
transcription factor that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the knockout having the opposite
phenotype to this dominant mutation was a
[SPEAKER_00]: great relief to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what is REF4?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't know for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has no domains that allow you to,
it has no ATPase domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even have a domain of unknown
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were actually left scratching
our head for the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: time about what this thing is really doing
until somebody purified the mediator
[SPEAKER_00]: complex from Arabidopsis and REF4
immunoprecipitated with the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is mediator?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a large 30 protein transcriptional
regulatory complex that can associate with
[SPEAKER_00]: another kinase module and bring in yet
another four proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is that it's divided into
a number of modules, and this so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: tail module interacts with transcription
factors bound to DNA, both locally and at
[SPEAKER_00]: a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it does so, the head and middle
module can recruit to the transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: start site the general transcriptional
machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in doing so, by making contacts
with a number of transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: bound upstream of genes, it can sort of
interpret that information and lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: coordinated transcriptional output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we had identified was Med5,
a subunit of the tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really fairly fanciful,
but if you look at the EM reconstructions
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, they're a little bit hard to
interpret.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways, the schematic is more
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, Med5 is the protein that we've
been looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we understand now that we've got a
protein that's involved in phenylpropenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a missense allele that suppresses
phenylpropenoid gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, for reasons that are,
well, entirely serendipitous in my lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were making multiple mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My postdoc was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can now circle back to this Ref8
mutant that I mentioned earlier that was
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked earlier in the pathway and made
only H.
[SPEAKER_00]: lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick made a triple mutant, in fact,
between Ref8, this very sad plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this knockout of these two flavors of
this Med5 mediator subunit, and found that
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants were capable of growing
again, which was a big surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we thought, well, this is all just
to do with malformed lignin and lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to transport water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these plants grow just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was quite a puzzle to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Nick found was that it was actually
able to restore lignin deposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is a measure of lignin
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the dwarf mutant,
it's very much suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we bring in the mediator
mutations, that lignin content goes back
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it is the case that these plants
can transport water properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly look like they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, it's not the case that we had in
any way restored normal phenylpropenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are still blocked at the same
place we thought that they were blocked
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we could really see that clearly
was by doing the lignin analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is work done in John Ralph's lab
by Yuki Tobimatsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were really interested in
lignin, you'd look at this and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, but you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain why you should be
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 2D NMR lignin analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue stands for the G subunits,
the green for the S subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these red resonances here are 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: These H subunits that are normally just
very, very minor components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these plants that are growing
normally are making this type of lignin
[SPEAKER_00]: that people thought plants couldn't make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, we thought, was pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, what I've introduced along the way
to you are plants that make GS copolymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure G, pure S, and now pure H lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how this polymer can be
very readily manipulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, for those of us in the lignin
community, that was pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is this mediator mutation restoring
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bottom line is that we still
don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you a couple of things that
aren't going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's not the case that the
low lignin is because phenylpropanide gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression for lignin synthesis is
downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the plant, because in fact,
in the ref 8 mutant, it's upregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these genes required for lignin
synthesis are upregulated in the mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're further upregulated in when we
knock out the mediator subunit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that we're restoring overall
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly something more complicated
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try and get a handle on that,
we did an RNA-seq experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that there's a
number of things I guess I should point
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left are the upregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right are the downregulated genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're comparing the mediator subunit
double knockout, the lignin mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the triple mutant from both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is there's a huge number of genes that
are misregulated in that very dwarf plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably to be expected in a
plant that is so developmentally
[SPEAKER_00]: perturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are relatively few genes that are
altered in expression when you knock out
[SPEAKER_00]: this mediator subunit, which we're
continuing to study this in lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the impact of altering mediator on
gene expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, it's surprisingly
modest for what we always consider to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an important component of this
transcriptional regulatory apparatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the triple mutant, almost all of
the genes, over 90% of the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: misregulated in the mutant are returned to
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so before I go to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we still haven't identified the
actual cause from all of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too big a number of genes to be
able to focus in on what the actual cause
[SPEAKER_00]: of that dwarfing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're almost inclined at this point to
say that it's not that the low lignin
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the dwarfing, but perhaps it's the
other way around that we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: altering metabolism in such a way that we
get this massive transcriptional response
[SPEAKER_00]: that is mediator dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a sort of a theme that I'll
carry through the rest of the talk that
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps in these plants, some metabolite
is being detected that accumulates because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the block in lignin biosynthesis,
and that leads to mediator dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now I'm going to go on to my next
sort of case about, or a little vignette
[SPEAKER_00]: about mediator and how it may function in
regulating metabolism both within pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: and between pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an anecdote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from when I was a postdoc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1990s, before some of you
were born probably, and it was when I
[SPEAKER_00]: originally identified the FAL1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the one that makes the pure G
lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is two pots of
two different alleles of FAL1 and wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been growing these plants in an ice
growth chamber, and I needed the space for
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved the plants to someplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was higher light and a bit
warmer temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wild type plants did what wild
type plants are prone to do, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: upset with being moved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they accumulated a lot of
anthocyanins, commonly thought of as being
[SPEAKER_00]: stress metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet the FAL1 mutants did not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really perplexed about that for
about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to try and follow up on
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people in the front row can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you who have worked with
Arabidopsis know that Arabidopsis petioles
[SPEAKER_00]: and stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of anthocyanin there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's missing in these FAL1 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try and get a clearer signal,
we used this line called Pap1D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is an activation tagline that turns
on expression of a transcription factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a master regulator of anthocyanin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this very dark red
pigmentation in the petioles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just drives up the levels where they are
normally found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you cross that into a FAL1
background, that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get that level of acute of
anthocyanin accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really perplexing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I can show you this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cross sections of stems where you,
again, get a lot of anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation in Pap1D.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a FAL1 Pap1D double, you fail to
get anthocyanin accumulation in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells that would normally express that
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that it's clear that there's
some interaction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the perplexing thing about this is
that this enzyme of phenylpropanide
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism is not required for the
production of the anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: The anthocyanins branch off very early
from the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And synapomalate and S lignin very late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet we're seeing this interaction
between these, the accumulation of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very perplexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could see that if we want to do,
if we did HPLC analysis of those
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In wild type, there's a large peak of,
or a couple of large peaks of
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we measure by HPLC, the red line
represents the levels of anthocyanins in
[SPEAKER_00]: the FAL1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we compare
[SPEAKER_00]: the Med5 mutant, we see anthocyanins just
like in wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we combine Med5AB and FAL1,
we restore anthocyanin accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it's a little bit
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different anthocyanin that
accumulates because this anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has a synaptic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subunit on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that decoration is missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get a different anthocyanin
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say F5H isn't required for
anthocyanin accumulation, I mean the core
[SPEAKER_00]: of the anthocyanins, not the decoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this effect of FAL1 on the suppression
of anthocyanin accumulation is mediator
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we think is happening, and I'll show
some models a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is again, perhaps a metabolite upstream of
F5H is being sensed in a mediator
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent way and is shutting down
phenylpropionate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is I think where, yes,
this is where I go into the part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: talk where my slides got corrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next mutant I want to tell you about
is this mutant called REF2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one that isn't shown in this
slide, REF5.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who were here when my
postdoc interviewed Dr. Jung-Yim Kim,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the story that she told.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perhaps you'll be able to fill in the
gaps that are missing in my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two mutants, REF2 and REF5,
are low in synapomalate as that UV
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype reveals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can show that by HPLC as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, synapomalate content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these multiple REF2 alleles,
it's suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shown a long time ago, this was from
2003, that REF2 encodes a cytochrome P450
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent monooxygenase known as CYP83A1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the confusing thing at the time was
that these P450 monooxygenases are
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroxylases by and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the hydroxylases of the
phenylpropionate pathway have been
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for by that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that this P450 functions in a
different pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's watch this letter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: REF5 encodes the paralogue of REF2,
and that's CYP83B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm missing data off this
slide, so I can't show you the
[SPEAKER_00]: synapomalate levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is work that Jung-Yim published
in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is where I have to do like
interpretive dance or something instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you the pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of these enzymes function in
glucosinolate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you are probably familiar with
glucosinolates, yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of you who have not,
at least you have, if you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wasabi, for example, because it's the
horseradish or mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those glucosinolate degradation
products that give those products their
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 are enzymes of
glucosinolate biosynthesis, and yet a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct pathway from phenylpropionate
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distinct, you can see on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's distinct from the pathway on the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet these blockages at these enzymes
are affecting phenylpropionate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Jung-Yim went on to show was that,
so this is a more in-depth analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: this Ref5 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she showed was that if she blocked in
the Ref5 mutant, CYP83B1, synapomalate
[SPEAKER_00]: levels were downregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If she blocked the enzyme before it in the
pathway, synapomalate levels were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated, and this genetic lesion is
actually epistatic to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a double mutant,
these synapomalate levels are elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that says two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it looks like it could be a
compound between this block and this
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme and this enzyme that's responsible
for leading to the downregulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylpropionate metabolism, and also that
this crosstalk between glucosinolate
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis and phenylpropionate metabolism
is relevant in a wild-type context,
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you knock it out,
synapomalate levels actually go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a little bit of a schematic
that did survive the slide debacle here
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea here is that there are two
types of glucosinolates that are made in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methionine-derived ones, in which the
CYP83A1 functions to form an aldoxine as
[SPEAKER_00]: an intermediate, and tryptophan-derived
glucosinolates, in which CYP83B1
[SPEAKER_00]: functions, again, to form aldoxines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crosstalk appears to somehow affect
phenylpropionate metabolism, and Jeongim,
[SPEAKER_00]: by doing a suppressor screen, so she took
the Ref5 mutants, remutagenized those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looked for plants that were blue in
the M2 generation, she found, a discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: which I still feel like we're extremely
lucky, turns out to be, the suppressors
[SPEAKER_00]: turn out to be Med5.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the two subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this crosstalk, again, now between two
pathways rather than within one pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: is dependent upon mediator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also went on to show that the same
suppression was seen when she crossed the
[SPEAKER_00]: Med5 mutant into the Ref2 background,
which is the CYP83A1 involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: methionine-derived aldoxine synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that other blockage in the previous
slide that I mentioned, this one here,
[SPEAKER_00]: CYP79B2 and B3, is the enzyme that
converts these amino acids to their
[SPEAKER_00]: aldoxines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we block here, we get an
accumulation of aldoxine, it's perceived
[SPEAKER_00]: by Med5, and that somehow, impinges on
phenylpropionate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to try and determine how that
perturbation was enforced, what was
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible, what was involved in that
crosstalk, Jeongim did a RNA-seq
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's somewhat complicated because
she's comparing four different lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: so she's comparing Ref5, Ref2,
and then Ref5 with the mediator knockout,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Ref2 with the mediator knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what she was looking for, rather than
explaining it through here, I'd rather use
[SPEAKER_00]: these sort of cartoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she was looking for to find genes
involved in this crosstalk was genes that
[SPEAKER_00]: were upregulated in both Ref5 and Ref2,
whose upregulation was mediator-dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when we looked at Ref5 Med5 and
Ref2 Med5, they went down, or the other
[SPEAKER_00]: way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes that were downregulated in these
mutants that went back up to normal in the
[SPEAKER_00]: double.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are represented by 53 genes
and 18 genes, which is a manageable list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, she was able to identify
two genes that were of particular interest
[SPEAKER_00]: that met those criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are Kelch Repeat F-box proteins,
number 39 and number 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are upregulated in the
glucosinolate mutants, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulation is abolished when we knock
out Med5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do these things do?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are components of the process that
targets proteins for degradation by the
[SPEAKER_00]: proteasome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, these KFB proteins are known
to interact with PAL and target it for
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAL is the first enzyme of the
phenylpropionate pathway, and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: represented the proteasome with a garbage
disposal, and I apologize if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone here who works on the proteasome,
and I've compared your work to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so, and in fact, when she goes and
measures PAL activity in these various
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, she does indeed see that in the
lines that are upregulated for the KFB
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins, PAL activity is down,
and when we bring in the mediator
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations, that the PAL activity is no
longer reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, she's gone on to knock out
those KFB proteins and to summarize a
[SPEAKER_00]: large array of different mutants,
if she takes the Ref5 mutant, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced levels of synapomallate,
as of course I've been saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: and knocks out these three KFB proteins,
we get restoration of phenylpropionate
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that out of that RNA-seq
experiment, she was actually able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the least one protein that was,
or two proteins that were responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: this crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, I want to conclude with a
final story that goes back to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant that we identified that led us into
this mediator story, because we thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a valuable reagent to start,
I guess, dissecting mediator function in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mediators are very well studied in
humans and in yeast, and there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of mutants of mediator that show
its relevance to a variety of processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering time and whatnot, plant pathogen
interactions in plants, but we certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: are just starting to scrape the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a former graduate student of mine did
another suppressor screen as a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: start probing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's Columbia wild-type and the
Ref4-3 mutant, the dwarf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three knockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my student did a suppressor screen
looking, remutagenizing Ref4-3 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking for plants that were now blue
under UV, or big, or both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea behind it is to identify
other proteins that are required for this
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant form of this Med5 subunit to
exert its action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my student identified this array of
suppressor mutants and handed this project
[SPEAKER_00]: off to another grad student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was quantify
synapomallate levels, as well as lignin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll just focus on this for today,
but also sequence all of those suppressors
[SPEAKER_00]: and identify the genes in which they were
defective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although each mutant carries about 200
EMS-inducible mutations in the open
[SPEAKER_00]: reading frames of the genome, by taking a
candidate gene approach and looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: genes that are mutated in common,
basically an in silico allele test,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were easily able to identify the genes
that were responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these mutants, we find sort of a
spread of restoration of phenylpropionate
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black lines represent intragenic
mutations in Med5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we've turned this protein with this
one G to S mutation into a constituent,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dominant break on the pathway,
if we then knock it out, we would expect
[SPEAKER_00]: to see a reversal of that phenotype,
and indeed we do, although it's at various
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing that came out of the
screen was mutants in three different
[SPEAKER_00]: mediator subunits, different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Med2, Med16, and Med23.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all in the tail of mediator,
are thought to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Med5, and so we're right now in the,
well you can see it's listed as submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: here, we're understanding how these
different mediator knockouts might affect
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression on their own, and how they
affect gene expression in the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: this Ref4-3 mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think is quite interesting is that,
for example, these two, this belt,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll focus on this one, this suppressor
restores, well both of them actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that back, both of these
suppressors, one in Med2, one in
[SPEAKER_00]: intragenic mutation, restore growth,
but not phenylpropionate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can pull these apart again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the case that if we just muck
around with mediator, we will abolish the
[SPEAKER_00]: function of Ref4-3, because here's an
example of two different mediator
[SPEAKER_00]: knockouts, PFT1, Med25, and Med3,
and when we cross those into the Ref4-3
[SPEAKER_00]: background, we don't get restoration of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these results are specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a case of perturbing the
tail of mediator that blocks Ref4-3
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whitney went on to do an RNA-seq
experiment and found then, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: a continuing theme in that in Ref4-3,
one of the same KFB proteins involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: PAL degradation is dramatically
upregulated, and in her suppressors,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are restored to near normal,
suggesting that this PAL degradation is
[SPEAKER_00]: again, in this context, responsible for
the phenotypes that we see in this view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just wrap up now and say,
well, so here are our models then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the glucosinolate example,
we have a crosstalk between two pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: that is mediator dependent, where if we
block glucosinolate synthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that leads to the accumulation of
these aldoxines, these are perceived
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow by Med5, and we lead to
upregulation of these KFB proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: which target PAL for degradation,
and therefore, we reduce the downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: components of this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of anthocyanins, we think
there's a similar thing going on where
[SPEAKER_00]: when we block F5H, there's a buildup of an
upstream metabolite that is perceived by
[SPEAKER_00]: Med5, or directly or indirectly,
that also turns on KFB decreases PAL,
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably in a cell type specific way,
knocks down anthocyanin synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Ref8, it's a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do know that KFB gene expression is
enhanced in that very dwarf mutant that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had in C3'H, perhaps again, because of a
buildup of some metabolite, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another huge set of changes in gene
expression that lead to dwarfing that are
[SPEAKER_00]: Med5 dependent, so it's a more complicated
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of Ref4-3, we have,
in fact, a mutant form of this Med5
[SPEAKER_00]: protein that has the ability to
constitutively turn on this KFB protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to PAL degradation and impact on
phenylpropanide metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope I've convinced you that Mediator
is involved in phenylpropanide
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would desperately like to know what
it's perceiving and how it's perceiving
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and we have efforts going on in the
lab to try and figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that first example, the dwarfing that
we've seen in low lignin plants can be
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressed genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always thought it was sort of a
mechanical problem to do with water
[SPEAKER_00]: transport, but it's much more complicated
than that, involving Mediator and
[SPEAKER_00]: aberrations in gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This KFB-mediated degradation of PAL seems
to be a common mechanism for regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: this pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous to that, and I really shouldn't
end this talk without mentioning that this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole idea was first identified by C.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liu at Brookhaven, and without that
knowledge that he contributed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, we still wouldn't understand
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, we really thought that it was
feedback from cinnamate, the product of
[SPEAKER_00]: the enzyme, so this is a really important
new paradigm, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would also say that, since I
mentioned it in passing, we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: H-lignin plants, we've got G-lignin
plants, we've got S-lignin plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants with modified lignins are,
I think, very going to be, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable for the biorefinery industry,
if that ever really gets going,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's taking an important or an
abundant product in the plant cell wall
[SPEAKER_00]: and turning it into something with more
defined characteristics, and thereby could
[SPEAKER_00]: be more easily converted to downstream
products of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I guess I would like to
thank the people who did the work,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Anderson and Nick Bonowitz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Bonowitz worked on all the ref-8
suppression stuff, Nick, and Nick together
[SPEAKER_00]: on the anthocyanin project, Jung-Yim on
the glucosinilate project, and Whitney and
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake on the ref-4-3 suppressor project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also my collaborators, John and Yuki,
who did the NMR, and CJ, and Brian Dilks
[SPEAKER_00]: for help with the sequencing and
suppressor analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I will say thank you very
much for your attention and the
[SPEAKER_00]: invitation.
Thank you very
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question about the dwarf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dwarf is in the NMR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be slightly different angle
from this matter, but there's a mutant
[SPEAKER_02]: called the lesion-mimic mutant,
which continuously operates crystal-less
[SPEAKER_02]: ligands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, a lot of the lesion-mimic
mutants have worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow, I just think there is a link
between these two, because it's also from
[SPEAKER_02]: the anion-line biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
So is there any, do you think,
like a feedback mechanism, if you
[SPEAKER_02]: over-express a solid acid, does that
suppress the beginning biosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of people simply argue that
if you have a lot of defense mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: like over-expression of a solid acid,
then the energy distribution of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: would be more biased to the defense
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the growth is suppressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think lignin might be the one of the
suppression of the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot rolled up into that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you what little I know
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, yes, there's growth
defense trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quantitatively, lignin is vastly more
abundant than SA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever we're doing with lignin,
although it could add to SA, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: how much SA a plant makes is really
closely tied to lignin abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also say that one of my other grad
students will be very happy to hear that
[SPEAKER_00]: you asked this question, because I didn't
have time to talk about it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once Wendy had basically completed her
Ref 4-3 suppressor analysis, my other
[SPEAKER_00]: student, Candy, asked whether the CDK8
kinase module, which is known to have
[SPEAKER_00]: repressive effects on transcription,
could be involved in the phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we see in the Ref 4-3 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she showed that it was, that knocking
out CDK8 reverses dwarfism, but has no
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on phenylpropanone metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at her transcriptome data,
she saw that SA synthesis, conjugation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and response genes were all upregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she said, oh, let's test the hypothesis
that SA is involved in the dwarfing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she knocked it out with,
by crossing in a syntactic SID2 mutation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and found that SID2 does not, it reduces
SA accumulation as expected, but it had no
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on growth of this mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say it doesn't contribute at
all, but there are other factors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more important in that particular case,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, certainly there's many different
pathways that are, that are perturbed when
[SPEAKER_00]: you knock out different mediator subunits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, geoanalysis will always tell you
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what set of genes you look at
practically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with regard to about the glucosinolate
crosstalk, I'm still of two minds about
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been trying to actually ask the
question, is this, as you sort of framed
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I don't think I did, but I think it's
reasonable that you did, that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have crosstalk to coordinate the
two pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there might be some situation
where you want to use phenylpropanides for
[SPEAKER_00]: defense, and other times when you want to
use glucosinolides for defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a good model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it kind of a pharmacological effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know we can do a chemical biology
experiment, and we can add compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: exogenously to yeast or seedlings or
whatever, and see an effect on a pathway,
[SPEAKER_00]: on growth, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this crosstalk something that
operates like that, just so happens that
[SPEAKER_00]: these aldoxines have this effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they, is this crosstalk truly
important for biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would think that if such a
pharmacological effect exists,
[SPEAKER_00]: it must exist sort of as a precursor to
the evolution of important coordination
[SPEAKER_00]: between pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know what, there's gotta be
something for evolution to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until there is something like that,
I don't know how you evolve, pardon the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of teleology, such a crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm reluctant to say that this is
really metabolic coordination,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer, I'm not sure that
answers your question a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So along those regards, could you find
evidence for that if there was cell type
specific variation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're seeing, for example,
around vascular tissue, there's lots and
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of linear composites compared with,
say, endermal cells where maybe you want
to have more of it be refilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you see cell type specialization within
an organ, and you see different sets of
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions or degrees of expression
being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps that would talk to this idea that
it's being called to predominantly balance
[SPEAKER_02]: cell types and different situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but at the same time, we have to ask
whether that's coming about because of,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of what mediator is doing,
or whether it's coming about because of
[SPEAKER_00]: where, just by happenstance, there's an
overlap between glucosinolated and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenylpropionate metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you see any predominant expression
within a lead, for example, in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: cell types?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, we don't see it at very high
levels, and it's actually been a big pain
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually be looking at,
to go back to cell cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mere stomatic cells seem to be where it's
expressed most highly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're actually trying to get at this
question by installing the aldoxine
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesizing enzymes, the CYP79,
in non-glucosinolated producing plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask, do you see the same impact on
phenylpropionate metabolism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would argue that it is a
pharmacological effect, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question, do you know if there's any
circadian regulation of M5 or the
[SPEAKER_02]: mediator?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really see very little interesting
things when you look at expression
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of the mediator complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's because it's required for
most regulated gene expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it has to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you do see it, some of the subunits
up in Mere stumps, and whether that
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects a particular role for those
subunits, or just higher requirements for
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription in those cells, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm ready for the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please join me.
