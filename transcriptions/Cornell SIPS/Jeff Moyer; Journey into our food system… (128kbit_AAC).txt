[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Steve invited me to come up here,
I was really pleased and honored to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to come up and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I walked in the room,
I saw so many people and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, that's a good turnout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, yeah, don't get too full of
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's a course requirement,
I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm glad you're here, and I'm glad to
have the opportunity to talk with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little bit about
Rodale, but I also want to talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodale and the work that we do really fits
into the bigger picture of this journey
[SPEAKER_00]: into our food system, because it's really
about food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can people hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all stems from our founder's
conversation that he had with some other
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1942, he wrote the words on a
blackboard, healthy soil equals healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: food equals healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what he was really telling us as
farmers, and I also farm at home with my
[SPEAKER_00]: son.
[SPEAKER_00]: My son actually manages the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a certified organic dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He owns the cows, and he owns the
equipment, and he manages the dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodale was telling us was he was saying,
our job is not to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about soil health,
but he said your job really isn't even to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce healthy soil, your job,
your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of the farm is to make healthy
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way we can do that is by
having healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you go back in time a
little bit, Franklin Roosevelt is noted
[SPEAKER_00]: for saying, a nation that destroys its
soil destroys itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look across this country,
you'll see that we're destroying our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody see this movie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Martian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most people have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the premise of the movie?
[SPEAKER_00]: The premise of the movie is, this poor sot
gets stuck on Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a botanist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that's ever taken potatoes out of
the store and tries to plant them knows
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they grew in Mars, and they grew on
Mars because he had the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: No soil, no food, no food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the actor's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're destroying our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're destroying our soil's ability to
work with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the ramifications of that
from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are space images, and you can see it
from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell everybody, if you want to buy
really prime agriculture real estate,
[SPEAKER_00]: buy the Gulf of Mexico right now,
because that's where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's plans underway to figure
out how to pump phosphorus off the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can send it back to Iowa,
and run it back down the river again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pump it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're running out of mineable
sources, and eventually it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper to just suck it up off the ocean
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look around the world a little
bit, the World Wildlife Foundation says
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've lost 1.7 billion acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look across the globe,
we've lost half of the planet's soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the soil in the last 150 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we won't live on 150 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us will be here in another 150
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody will be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whoever's here needs the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't take care of it,
it won't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while this is happening all over the
country, if you talk to farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter where you go, what state,
farmers will say, it's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all contributing to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This corn wasn't planted in the Middle
East.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't planted in the middle of the
river.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the river ate the bank
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens when we consider yield as
the only goal for our farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If yield is the only indicator of success,
we're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit like saying the only way
we're going to judge your success is a
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to look at your whole
personal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to say, how much money do you
have in the bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way we're going to judge
you as a successful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our farms are all failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our food system is failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to ignore the fact that Lady
Gaga fell off the stage in the concert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a screenshot off of CNN's web page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back, I saw this in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said, we are changing the age at
which young women enter puberty in this
[SPEAKER_00]: country because of the food that we feed
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor who presented this information,
they said, well, what are we supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: She was from the American Academy of
Pediatrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, the only thing we can do is eat
organic food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the food that we're producing is
not designed to produce healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed to maximize the yield off a
per acre basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not even doing a good job of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having problems as farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is way back from 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known that the chemicals that we're
using to produce our food is causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: rampant Parkinson's disease and cancer
among the farmers who are applying the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as farmers, we have a
disproportionately high percentage of our
[SPEAKER_00]: population that's having cancers and
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's really a disturbing image.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work by Dr. Elizabeth
Gillette at the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was she went to the Yaqui
Valley in Mexico, near Sonora,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was she looked at
five-year-old girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened in Mexico was kind of a
unique phenomenon that gives us as
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers, and certainly Elizabeth
Gillette, an opportunity to glance into
[SPEAKER_00]: different food structures based on the
same culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: After World War II, we went down to
Sonora, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, what we did in California,
in the Central Valley of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do for you in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the Yaqui people said,
well, we like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want big agriculture and lots of
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the Yaquis said, no, that's not
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got pushed up into the hills,
into the foothills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the same genetic population
that was arbitrarily split over the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision of how to produce food and how to
treat the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she did was she looked at these
young girls and asked them, in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: she asked them to draw a picture of
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the children who didn't have
chemicals in their food system,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the children on the valley
floor did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're changing the way our brains function
and relate to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing that with the food that
we're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the mantra across
the, and if there's farmers in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mantra across agricultural systems
nationwide is, we have to feed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need these tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need this technology because we have to
feed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We waste, in this country, 50% of the
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Africa, it's closer to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they don't have good
refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crops all come in at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we waste tons and tons of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those of us who are involved at all in
nutrition or childhood nutrition know that
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood obesity is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that the school lunch program
was actually started by the military?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they had recruits coming in that
they wanted a draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were underweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we need to start feeding
them in the schools so when we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: draw a picture, draft them, we have
potential soldiers that weigh enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry a pack and a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the biggest problem they have is they
said all the recruits, the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: recruits, are overweight and obese and
can't carry a pack and a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I want people to carry packs and
guns, because that's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have problems with our well system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pointing out some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think it's important that we
look at the problems that we have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a problem with atrazine in our
well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the EPA did when they saw
all those polluted wells?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They raised the threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of those wells are polluted
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have to understand is all of us,
everybody in this room, has the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to vote with our dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can make changes in the way our
food is produced based on the way we spend
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along comes organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say organic is a niche market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $72 billion cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this country alone, it's up over,
this says $28 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's up over $32 billion in sales in
this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the number of farms
that are becoming certified organic today,
[SPEAKER_00]: a report just came out last week that said
our number of farms is up 12% in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still not meeting the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this demand is being met by
overseas imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at some other work that's
been done, this is reported by World Watch
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the work was actually done by the
University of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catherine Bagley was the researcher that
did this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wanted to look at the concept of,
if we created a model, could we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the world based on organic
productivity and organic production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she ran two different models that she
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the one model, we were just a
little bit under what we're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the second model, we were quite a
bit higher than what we're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: today, doing it organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting to me is,
I had some old statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't bring them along, I don't
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the number of dollars
that are spent on organic productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: versus conventional productivity,
the numbers I saw were from 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of dated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said at that time, we were
spending about $15 million on organic
[SPEAKER_00]: research and $3.8 billion on conventional
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't gained anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they have done is sold a lot of
product to a lot of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, again, some old data,
but this is from the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying that in the United States,
we exceeded 1.1 billion pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides that are applied to the
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that thinks we can put a billion
pounds of chemistry on the landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: year after year after year, without having
any impact on your personal health is
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Rodale was very emphatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed a picture of him up there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Rodale said, there's no point in
pointing out problems unless you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of nonprofits that sit all
around Washington DC that scream about the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have no solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all about solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really amazing that 2015 was the
International Year of the Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all stems from the relationship
that we have between plants and the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove up here from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where there wasn't snow, I saw
basically brown ground, bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's practically criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we're trying to do,
poor picture here, but we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that microbial life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no plant on the surface of the
soil, there's no way, no mechanism for us
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed that microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some data from our farming systems
trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really kind of interesting,
because what it shows is this gray line
[SPEAKER_00]: here is our conventional treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two bars are organic treatments,
one the reddish one, or dark brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: is one that had animal manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green one is based on legume as a
nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's looking at about 35 years,
34 years worth of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's showing us as farmers is the
way we manage the soil has an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: When J.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodale first started to farm, he bought a
70-acre farm in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was not a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a businessman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made electrical switch gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York City and Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said, I'm going to take some of
that money, and I'm going to buy a farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to get my children out of
New York City in the summer, fresh air,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the countryside, the original green
acres sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he never even owned a flower pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly he had 70 acres of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does he do?
[SPEAKER_00]: He calls the Land Grant University in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started talking to him about
poisons, to kill the insects, to kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, and to manage diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, no, I don't want to work with
poisons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do something with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought all this soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically said, yeah,
that's got nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean it's got nothing to do
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That just didn't make sense to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started playing around with these
organic systems way back in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why in 1942, he wrote that on a
blackboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1947, he created the Rodale
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1942, he started printing a
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a closet writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a very good writer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read any of his writings,
you'll know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote some plays for Broadway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought a mailing list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote a book called Organic
Gardening and Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought a mailing list, 10,000 names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent out a copy of his new magazine
to 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically he said, if you like it,
send me $1, and I'll send you some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got $7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us would go, that was a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A complete failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: G.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodale said, yesterday there was one
idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today there's eight of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty good math.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he kept going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, he created the
Publishing Empire of Rodale Incorporated,
[SPEAKER_00]: of which we're a sister organization at
Rodale Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all based on this concept of
changing the way we manage the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we manage the soil using only
chemistry, we cannot improve the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: content of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really all about the carbon
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're talking about is changing the
philosophy, changing the way we think
[SPEAKER_00]: about our management structure of our
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should be managing our farms to
capture carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can do that, we can reduce soil
erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reduce soil compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reduce air pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can reduce climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can improve the tilth and structure of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take advantage of the natural
fertility of the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farm at home, at Rodale, is 333 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't buy any nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been farming that ground for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never buy nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with carbon cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're building in the natural
fertility of the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we really need is a brown revolution,
not a green revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that brown revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get that brown carbon into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it out of the air into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way to do that is to keep the
soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to keep the soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, soil today is not covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve, I don't know if he's still in the
room, but he said he was at a SARE
[SPEAKER_00]: conference on cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cover crops are gaining some momentum
on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you talk to farmers, they've got a
problem with crop insurance and cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the USDA NRCS will pay farmers to
plant cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then crop insurance says you have to
kill them as soon as you can in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you void your crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because if you're going to kill
them with chemistry, you've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them when they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you wait until it's as tall as
me or as tall as this table, how are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get through there with a sprayer
and get good coverage and get a good kill?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if cover crops are indeed the best
employee that we have for sequestering
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, why would you kill them early
before they have a chance to do their
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants trade carbon with fungi and
bacteria under the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's life under the soil that we have
barely scratched the surface of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a soil microbiologist at the
Arroyo Institute, Dr. Chris Nichols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Dr. Nichols said is, when I
started my bachelor's degree, we thought
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew about this much about soil
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I got my PhD, we realized we
knew less than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, I told my father, you're the
only person I know that's spent a small
[SPEAKER_00]: fortune to make their child dumber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look what happens when we change the
carbon in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1%, 4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plots are five feet apart from each
other in the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change the soil's ability to manage
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at crop insurance,
what do we pay crop insurance for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say we because you all pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your parents pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay for drought, and we pay for
flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can change the way soil interacts
with water and save ourselves a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money if we would pay farmers to manage
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an older picture, but looking at
corn in our farming systems trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: These corn plots, this strip here in the
middle, is five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not rain more on this corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all dry land farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this corn would have been planted
two weeks after this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This corn has no carbon, cannot manage
water, and is subject to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we've done as a nation is we've
said, well, we know this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, so we're going to give this poor
bugger crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to subsidize his crop
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if a farmer had to go and buy crop
insurance on his own, what the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: said is you can never afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insurance rate would just be
astronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The crop isn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we as a nation said in our farm bill,
we'll subsidize this, and we'll give this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy the money, the same money that that
guy made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only fair, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this National Organic Program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, in effect, is the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that organic is the solution
because it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a solution because of the practices
it employs to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it employs practices that improve
the health of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's certified organic or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't really matter to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way we start thinking about the
soil and treating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by replacing chemistry and
biotechnology with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are both legitimate sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take classes at Cornell in biotech
and chemistry, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can take classes in biology,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're suggesting that we start to
focus our research dollars and our energy
[SPEAKER_00]: on looking at the biology of what's
happening in the soil and use biology to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we're really talking about is
changing the way we manage resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Southern California a few years
ago, stood in the middle of the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: took a picture one direction, turned 180
degrees, and took a picture in the other
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I stopped there,
there was a sign that said organic raisin
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side of the road is not organic
raisin grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same resources, same trellis
system, same crop, same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was just a road in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could even be the same farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Access to the same labor pool,
same machinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which side of the road do you want to live
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture yourself as an earthworm,
a soil microbe, a bird, a butterfly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which side of the road do you want to live
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a raisin grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which side of the road do you want to live
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty obvious we want to live on
this side of the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are we supporting agriculture that
creates that side of the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at some budgets and look at
the economics of this, because farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, it's all about yield,
and I've got to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to feed the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend in Illinois who farms
about 2,500 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw him in 2014 in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was at a meeting that we were
talking about healthy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, last year, I averaged 268
bushels of corn across 2,500 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't tell me my soil is not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, that doesn't mean your soil is
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a poor measuring stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barely crawl in the door because
you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hardly walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they take your blood pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your blood pressure is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, you're healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a poor indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, how many bushels of corn did it
take you to grow that in terms of input
[SPEAKER_00]: costs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he said, I need 250 bushels to break
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, so you grew 18 bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he said, I grew 268.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it costs you 250 to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only had 18 bushels of corn left
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow 18 bushels of corn on the lawn
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone in this room could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be a skilled
professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw him in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came up to me in the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time, I didn't approach him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up to me and he said, you know,
last year, you really pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, all year farming, all I could
think about was that 18 bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, he said, I grew 248
bushels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost money on every acre of corn I
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to change the way I manage my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my soil is not growing the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to change the way I manage my land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inputs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when something goes wrong in the
system, the inputs fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he made money because he had crop
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we paid him the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's look at the budgets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, some data that was put
together by Mississippi State.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work at Rodeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have an ag economist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with lots of different outside
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the economics professor there,
this was information or data from 2008
[SPEAKER_00]: through 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only three years worth of data,
not 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that three year period of time,
organic corn averaged $8.36 a bushel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conventional corn was $4.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, organic corn is slightly higher
than this, closer to 10 or 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conventional corn is more like $3.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers will be even more drastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at conventional corn that
uses a chisel plow, if you grew 100 bushel
[SPEAKER_00]: of corn, you lost $16 an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers say, well, I don't use a chisel
plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm modern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use no-till and more chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you lost $85.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, organic systems were
making over $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers don't take corn to the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take dollars, just like all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what occupation you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot back up to the back of the bank
and unload corn, soybeans, chickens,
[SPEAKER_00]: cattle, anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about putting dollars in
people's pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that these dollars are
higher is because consumers value the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that they're purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of misinformation out
there that gets a lot of headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature magazine in 2012 published an
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline read, overall organic yields
are typically lower than conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the title, it said,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was an English major.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time we have an argument and I
say, but, she said, every time you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, it means everything in front of it
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dinner was really good, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget that it was really good,
that but.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually read the article after the
but, after it said, but, it said,
[SPEAKER_00]: under certain conditions, that is,
with good management practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: popular crop types and growing conditions,
organic systems can nuts nearly match
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it really said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also said, oh, here is those research
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's old data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just saying, look how much data
we put in there to gain nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we gained is a lot of money
in certain people's pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a brother-in-law who works for one
of the largest seed companies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grow GMO crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every year at Thanksgiving,
we get to fight and argue about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he knows my son and I are organic
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes for interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, last year at Thanksgiving,
he said, OK, I'll admit that our non-GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: crops actually out-produce the GMO crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason you produce those is
because you make a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more money, he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers like it, because it's easy,
but they could care less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what they push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stanford did an article.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a kind of a medical article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a data analysis that they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cast out on the advantages of
organic meat and produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from 2012 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Stanford article has been retracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the article, what they said was
they cast out on organic meat and produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you actually read the report,
and nobody reads these studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you guys might like to read that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the average person on the street
doesn't want to read this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it actually said was two of the
studies showed significantly lower urinary
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide levels among children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that early puberty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember how much childhood obesity we
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have higher autism rates,
higher attention deficit disorder rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do to the soil in California
affects children in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: That connection is very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to start thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk for contamination of detectable
pesticides was lower in organic food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, well, OK, but that's
correlation, not causation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not for the scientists to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, if people say it's not in
the food, and I don't want it in me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to eat that food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in 1980, a study came out from the
USDA that said, well, if what Rodale's
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is true, because we had been saying
it for 40 years, why aren't more farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did a survey of farmers across
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of farmers said, well,
there's two things that stuck out in their
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was nitrogen is going to be a limiting
resource, because they didn't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention in junior high chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't remember that 78% of the
air we breathe is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is not a limiting resource on
planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it is and the form it's in,
that can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have legumes so we can work on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said we're going to have to buy
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set this experiment up to be a
nitrogen-based experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also said there's not enough
hardcore science behind organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been running this experiment for
35 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's three main systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of those systems are split
between tillages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an organic with manure-based
system with animals, legume-based system
[SPEAKER_00]: without animals, and a conventional system
that uses conventional fertilizer and
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide for weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have tilled and no tilled in all of
these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do look at yields, because you have to
talk about yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A system that doesn't produce is not
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it does have to produce food,
because we do eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't eat soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could just eat soil, ooh,
party over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd all just have organic soil,
a big bowl of it, and we'd be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have to produce some yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really interested in the whole
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to look at what all the
environmental impacts are and the human
[SPEAKER_00]: health impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at soil health, water quality,
energy analysis, and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the hands of Dr. Ray Weil from
the University of Maryland, holding two
[SPEAKER_00]: clumps of soil from our FST researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of research plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this brightly lit room,
in this old photo, you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in those soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see the difference in a
picture, imagine how the microbial life
[SPEAKER_00]: that lives in it can tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look what happens when you put those
soils in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason Iowa and Illinois and every
other state out there is washing down the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi River and New York and
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not off the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we're washing our soils down
the river is not because we farm them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the way we farm them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not suggesting we put everything in
the Midwest into tall grass prairie,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a few million buffalo out there,
and get some Sioux Indians to manage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not suggesting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're suggesting that if we manage our
soils differently and you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, we can have the same amount of
food we have today, and we can improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil while we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to think about
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Bob Rodale said was, he said,
if you think about the system as a
[SPEAKER_00]: conglomeration of biological components,
it actually improves when you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we would all, instead of sitting here
in this room, be running around
[SPEAKER_00]: exercising, we would be getting stronger,
not wearing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Rodale was an avid bicycle rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He built a velodrome to train the Olympic
bicycle team.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really into bicycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, but when I ride my bicycle,
the only thing that wears out is the
[SPEAKER_00]: bicycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get stronger and healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil has to be exercised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with an Amish farmer,
and we were trying to get him to make
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and put compost out of the field
because we didn't have enough compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't like that he was daily spreading
dairy manure out of his dairy barn every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, he said, no, you don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I work with horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the horses don't have work to do every
day, what they do is they stand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: barn, they get fat and lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in spring, I want to get them out to
plow, and they can't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were all Olympic athletes and we did
nothing all season long, all winter long,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the time corn starts to senesce in
September here, it's not even planted yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: in April, so we're going to plant it here
at the end of April, early May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lay on the couch from September to
May, and then got up and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to perform as an Olympic
athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we asked the soil to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it can't do it, so we have to put
inputs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're saying is let's change the
way we manage the soil, change our
[SPEAKER_00]: management strategies, and we can improve
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did here in this field was we
started with this and turned it into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did in Iowa was we started with
this and turned it into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, Iowa is going this way,
this way, this way, and organic farms are
[SPEAKER_00]: going this way, this way, this way,
steadily improving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that in organic systems,
we use 45% less energy to grow the same
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not four or five percent, 45%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at yields over time,
not within given years, because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of years when the conventional
system outperforms organic, let's not take
[SPEAKER_00]: that away from conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientists that work on developing
conventional systems are really smart
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've developed systems, it's sort of
like a thoroughbred racehorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the track is right, that horse can
run, and you're not going to catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when is the track perfect anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at all the cyclical changes
that we have across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the weather patterns that are
changing, impacts of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that that racehorse is
having trouble running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at it over the history of a
farmer, and most farmers farm for 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_00]: or 50 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at it over that time,
the yields are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil organic matter and soil
structure improve in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use 45% less energy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We emit 40% less greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and we're three to four times more
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why organic agriculture is growing
at 12% a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's great concern that it's going
to grow much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not concerned by me, but concerned by
people who are selling products to those
[SPEAKER_00]: other farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look a little bit at nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if people know how nitrogen
fertilizer is produced, but it's produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by the Harbor Bosch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a lot of energy to produce
nitrogen fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, to produce a kilogram of
conventional fertilizer, we have to burn
[SPEAKER_00]: about a liter of oil and 17.6 cubic feet
of natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can do the same thing with cover
crops and legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, PepsiCo owns Tropicana orange
juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, they did a carbon footprint study
of what it takes to put orange juice on
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast tables across America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought that what they would do
is they would have to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, change their distribution
systems, transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was published in the New York
Times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they found was 30% of their carbon
was in the form of nitrogen fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which organic orange growers get by
putting legumes under the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to California, Florida,
Texas, wherever you're growing oranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you look at the conventional orchards,
they are brown, barren ground under the
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep it clean, spray herbicides under
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we have any life in the soil when
there's bare ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you have to put fertilizer in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they inject fertilizer in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all their carbon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing they could change
anywhere in their system and account for
[SPEAKER_00]: that much carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they changed their system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we need to have solutions for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell farmers that we have to change
the way we're farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can convince them that it's important
for them to do it and that they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: an impact on the health of their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what sort of tools are we going to
give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we're saying that tillage is
inherently wrong, I mean, keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are hundreds of billions of microbes
holding that thing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And earthworms underneath it are saying,
get this off of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's think differently about how we
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I came at the approach to this
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were starting to reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a team of scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the scientists said,
I was a farm manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Jeff, you till the ground too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to improve soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using a very diverse crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're still doing some tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworms and microbes don't like
tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picture yourself as an earthworm on
tillage day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started to reduce tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved from a moldboard plow to a chisel
plow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used a heavy disk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was our weed pressure
and our weed population started to go off
[SPEAKER_00]: the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just couldn't manage weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can show you lots of data to support
that from our soils and the way we were
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I was looking at a garden,
I said, well, in a garden, we put mulch on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that has a garden knows if you
lay, in this case, straw, you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper, carpet squares, plywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you put down on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lay it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual weeds won't germinate and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perennial weeds, that's a different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But annual weeds won't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I told you or told a farmer in Iowa
that they had to do 5,000 acres of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would probably not be that polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Canada, they would be
polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're in Iowa, they'll get up and
walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we can grow the mulch right in
the field, terminate it in place without
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, and then, using modern planting
technology, stick our seeds and our
[SPEAKER_00]: transplants in the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic is not opposed to modern science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we're opposed to is things
that don't fit into J.I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodell's sieve that says we're trying to
produce healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody in the room think that
spraying Roundup makes people healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could argue or discuss whether it makes
people unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no farmer puts it on the ground to
make people healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plan is to kill weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a very powerful antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monsanto holds two patents on glyphosate
as an antibiotic, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was any other system,
you wouldn't be allowed to utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But farmers don't put it on as an
antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never would be allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not opposed to modern
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to use a GPS guidance
system, if you want to use satellite
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, if you want to use robot
driven tractors, does any of that make
[SPEAKER_00]: people unhealthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the application that we're talking
about here, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to use modern no-till
planter technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about going backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the future of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at how these systems perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were two fields that were,
at the Rodell Institute, happened to be
[SPEAKER_00]: side by side, not part of a research
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: This field over here was alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa is a perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot kill perennials with a roller
crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give them a bad day, but you
cannot kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because it was alfalfa, I mo-bored
plowed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I disked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cul-de-packed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted my corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because it's an organic field and
we don't use herbicide, I rotary hoed it
[SPEAKER_00]: twice, cul-de-vated it twice, harvested
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine trips over the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a respectable 143 bushel of
corn on our soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, I had a field of hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a winter annual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can kill that with a roller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the roller on the front of the
tractor, as you see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the planter on the back of the
tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's one pass over the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did nothing else to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No fertilizer, no herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't manage the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left the biology of the system to manage
the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back and harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had two trips over the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got 160 bushels of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which system works better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even within an organic system,
we can start to improve the soil and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have more conventional farmers
using this system than we do organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't need to be a rocket
scientist to understand that if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to drive over the field seven,
eight, or nine times, and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to put herbicide on there, you stand a
chance of making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our roller, which is like this,
is 10 foot wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody wants to farm with 10 foot
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ag engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're not opposed to ag
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son,
farms in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, Nebraska, Arizona, and South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may have other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: His rollers, and he has two that are 60
foot wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a 40 footer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got an eight footer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's rolling cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard Buffett did not drink the Kool-Aid
and believe in organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he does believe in improving the
health of his soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does believe in putting money in
his pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said, if I plant GMO soybeans
and I don't have to spray herbicide,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm improving the health of the soil and
putting money in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get people to move in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like off the hood of
the tractor and out of the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a corn field that was planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you picture this being planted in
May, and you get those June heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: thunderstorms where you're going to get
three or four inches of rain in a four
[SPEAKER_00]: hour period or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no soil going to move here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any rain that does fall there,
we get to capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't run off the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers in California like this
system because it has cooler soil
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures when they go to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in California last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the Central Valley of California
in summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 110 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lay on the ground and throw black
plastic over yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we say, well, there's no
microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cooked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under these mulch systems, they can
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's corn in the middle of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works with corn, it'll work with
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it works with soybeans, it'll work with
watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work with transplanted crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make it work with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main point is we have to change and
reevaluate and rethink what it is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers have never been asked to improve
the health of their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been asked to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start to ask them to do
that as a nation, as a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never asked them to produce healthy
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the supermarket,
there's no way for you to know how a
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot was actually produced or what the
vitamin or mineral content is of that
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to buy a pet food, you can find
everything out about that pet food,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not about the food we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carrots are all carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apples are all apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you call the Milk Marketing Board,
because we're a dairy farm, the Milk
[SPEAKER_00]: Marketing Board says there's no difference
between organic milk or milk from cows
[SPEAKER_00]: that were fed grass versus milk from cows
that were fed grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Milk is milk, they'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's all white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like saying cars are all cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have a BMW, me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus a Kia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have four wheels and a steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not the same car.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference in the way we produce
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a difference in the way we
need to start valuing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what's more important than the
food we put into ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to vote with our dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start changing how we think
about food, how we think about how that
[SPEAKER_00]: food was produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trace it back to the soil, because that's
really important, both to the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: health and to our personal health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to change policy to
support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're going to give farmers money,
and I'm not arguing whether we should or
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't, but if we're going to give
farmers subsidies, shouldn't we subsidize
[SPEAKER_00]: them to bring carbon into the system,
if that's where we all benefit from?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're all going to pay, and again,
we can argue whether we should all pay or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's irrelevant today in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're all going to pay,
let's pay for something we all get
[SPEAKER_00]: something out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That soil washing down the Mississippi
River is not the farmer's soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours and my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get to manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get to enjoy that countryside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, because they paid for it,
and rightly so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't give them the right to
destroy it for all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to start thinking about getting
animals onto farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a project right now with Iowa
State University and the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota looking at integrating livestock
onto farms, getting them out on grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: out on pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that not every farmer that
grows crops wants to have livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are many people who want to have
livestock that wouldn't mind putting on
[SPEAKER_00]: grass if they had access to the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a project in Florida right now,
a 200-acre site, where the cattle come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They graze.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not our cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that at the Rodale Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We graze a 65-cow dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't own a cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dairy daycare.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those grass pastures are
potentially crop fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every crop field is potentially a
pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a third of Iowa was in pasture
today, can you imagine how beautiful that
[SPEAKER_00]: would look from an airplane when you fly
over it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine the way we would be
changing the way that soil is produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can vote with our dollars for the
way we buy beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy beef like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple years ago, a guy, a journalist,
and I can't remember his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a study where he went to Iowa and
bought a calf off of a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he traced it through the entire
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a chance to look it up online
and figure it out, it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way to Kansas and to a Kansas
feedlot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sold his calf and he got the
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got $3.80.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, so that calf had to be managed
and fed for 18 months for a profit of
[SPEAKER_00]: $3.80.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason somebody has to own this
many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got to make a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need 100,000 of them in one place
to make a decent living.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's no way to raise animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is NRCS doing with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody know?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting a roof over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, they're building roofs in Iowa
at about 100 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said animals belong indoors,
not on pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solution is not to let them stand in
the rain where all that manure washes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're razor wires to
keep cows in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why people would want to jump
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are so large and dusty
that they have to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have irrigation systems over them,
if you've ever seen them, to water it down
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the dust down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the cattle suffocate from the
dust and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to spray the dust down so the
manure doesn't come up and fill their
[SPEAKER_00]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, NRCS says, well, the problem is
that water, rain falls on that and that
[SPEAKER_00]: washes into the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's put a roof over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're spending a year of my money to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that because we just got a heifer
barn built over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on our farm at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all helped to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But NRCS said, we're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we said, yeah, but our heifers go
outside every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they have to be under the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they have to go outside on grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal law says they must go out and
eat grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yeah, but our law says they
have to stay under the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we created a sacrifice lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be allowed to go
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go outside every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's raining, snowing,
freezing, cold, hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why shouldn't cattle want to go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: They should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they belong outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got to get them on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all have a vote on how that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we need to meet the challenge with
more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all the minds in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need bright, intelligent people working
on these systems so that we can move away
[SPEAKER_00]: from what's not working in terms of human
health and environmental health into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is working and is not
sustainable, but is regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to regenerate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the word sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend, I don't know if Craig
Kramer is still in the room, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Bowman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg Bowman once said to me, think about
sustainability that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, if somebody asked you how your
relationship was with your spouse or your
[SPEAKER_00]: boyfriend or girlfriend, and you said,
oh, it's sustainable, would people be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would they be sad for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we try to sustain a bad system
when we want to regenerate and grow a much
[SPEAKER_00]: more productive system?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very dynamic website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you all to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you all to come to see our
website and look at what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the numbers, here in New York
State, New York State has about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: million acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't count them, but somebody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that, someone at the
National Statistics Service said there's
[SPEAKER_00]: about seven million acres here.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Rodale Institute, we have a CSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feed 285 families of four on eight
acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what we really want to do is feed the
world, New York State could feed one
[SPEAKER_00]: billion of our seven billion people in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we really trying to feed the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what we're trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we've ever tried to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change the way people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage you all to come to the
research station and visit us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if we would change the way we
farm and sequester carbon, we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture has never been invited to the
table to discuss the impacts on climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have deliberately been kept out of the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers want it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say if you're not seen as part of the
problem, you cannot be seen as part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not part of the solution,
you can't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be at the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were in Paris at the COP21 meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Nichols was there presenting our
information in our paper and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is the greatest sink that we have for
carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the greatest tool we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is a tool that makes it all
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because Bill Gates didn't design it
doesn't mean it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not man-made high tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's high tech, and that's what we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to change our public support,
which we have in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why demand is outstripping supply
across the board in every market
[SPEAKER_00]: component, every stock item in a store,
in a supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get enough milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get enough organic chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't get enough feed to feed those
chickens because consumers want the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got to turn that into public
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to turn that into public policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I understood the question right,
you're saying at the Paris meetings is the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that it's not being brought up
because nonprofits aren't bringing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've been standing on the wings
screaming and yelling for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because agriculture doesn't want to
be part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whenever you're part of the
conversation, there could be new rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if the new rules that came out said,
oh, agriculture wants to be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you have to sequester carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed us you're the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to change the way you're
farmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People go, oh, time out, time out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to change what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to sign on to that part of
the accord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to change the way
people actually manage all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: If New York has 7 million acres of
landscape, look at California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's big states with lots of
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all being managed by individual
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start to tell them what
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've deliberately lobbied Farm
Bureau lobbies against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ag industries lobby against being
considered part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: No,
[SPEAKER_00]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great support from other
nonprofits for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's other parts of the industry say ag
should not, just like ag isn't part of
[SPEAKER_00]: many conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were a construction company and you
went out and you turned 7 million acres of
[SPEAKER_00]: New York upside down in a matter of weeks,
you'd need all kinds of erosion and
[SPEAKER_00]: sediment control plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But farmers can do whatever they want
because we're grandfathered in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to be seen as picking on
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people telling me what to do
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is we have to change the
way we manage these landscapes if we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the desired impact that we want to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was about the size of organic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the market grows, we obviously are
getting larger and larger players coming
[SPEAKER_00]: into organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we first started our farming
systems trial, everybody said you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can garden organically, but you cannot
farm organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we proved you could farm
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, OK, you can farm organically,
but you can't do it at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have farmers that are doing it
at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, OK, so you can do it at
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really doesn't make any difference
because it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really impacting the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it takes 15 years to get that
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And USDA is doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iowa State's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Wisconsin have these
long-term studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all finding very similar
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can change the health of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually change how that soil
functions in the environment based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: practices we superimpose on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they said, OK, well, you can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do it at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does make a difference with the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't correlate changes in the
soil to changes in human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those things happen, consumer
demand grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get larger players.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the players get bigger and they have
more money, they're going to push back on
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can all agree with this,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what political party you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress generally gets it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they get some things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got the Organic Food Production
Act right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what they did was they created a
very strong National Organic Standards
[SPEAKER_00]: Board, a FACA committee that's made up of
15 members who are selected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Secretary of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people either get nominated or
nominate themselves to be on that board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the board is done in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every meeting is attended by the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to most FACA meetings, and there's
no one in the room but the FACA members.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to a National Organic Standards
Board meeting, and there will be hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of people in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all have something to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're watchdog groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're watchdog individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be watching that
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they make sure that those standards
are strong and tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it says organic on the label,
if it has the USDA seal, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what scale it's produced at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It follows that standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can argue whether that's good for
society or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my personal belief is that as long as
they're following the standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a good enough manager to do it
at that scale, God bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why you'd want to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But God bless you, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's scale neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do two square feet,
that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do two square miles,
that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you follow the same rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you can do that as a
manager, good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the question was, why are we anti-GMO
as we look at what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really lucky on the organic side of
the fence, because that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things Congress put in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot use GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't care what it was, or how good
you thought it might be, or anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not allowed inorganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we don't use it is because
there's been little or no evidence shown
[SPEAKER_00]: yet that it's something we really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about drought-proofing corn,
or corn varieties that do better in
[SPEAKER_00]: drought, we would rather drought-proof the
soil, and we get the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're changing the biology of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Rice hasn't really lived up to its
expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high-license corn that was done by
conventional plant breeding, do you
[SPEAKER_02]: against that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, any that was done with conventional
plant breeding, we allow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's allowed in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't allow genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you change the genetic package in a
crop, you don't just stick one gene in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring whole packages of genes that get
spliced in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complicated, and you probably
know more about it than I do, but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very complicated process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with those gene splicings,
you get all sorts of other things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go across corn fields that have GMO
corn today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more lignin in corn that is
produced with genetic modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get that with a conventional
breeding also.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not anti-science at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pick and choose the science that we
want to put together to produce food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to consume products that
have GMO in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can disagree, and a lot of the
country does disagree, but most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world is moving away from GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe doesn't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's in the standards because it says
you can't use it, so it's never discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the only way to change that would be
to go to Congress and open up the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organic industry would fight tooth
and claw to never let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if that happens, you cannot open
the law for one thing and not open it for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the law is opened up for
conversation, the cat's out of the bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everybody's going to talk about every
piece of it that they want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took us 12 years to get from the
law to a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to go through another 12
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I doubt that's ever going to be allowed
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should probably stop there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
