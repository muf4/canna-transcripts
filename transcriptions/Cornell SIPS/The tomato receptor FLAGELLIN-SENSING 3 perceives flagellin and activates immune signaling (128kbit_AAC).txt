[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you for filling in for a break,
because I know he's on sabbatical now,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's nice to have a wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for having me here today to
talk to you about my work, where I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to describe to you how we identified a
tomato receptor that we call flagellum
[SPEAKER_00]: sensing 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it perceives the peptide like 228 and
activates immune signaling in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to acknowledge this was
a huge collaborative project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to especially emphasize there
were two postdocs in Greg's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pat Boyle and Shilin Rao, who were really
helpful for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't have done any of the work
without Cesar Strickler, who's here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was a bioinformaticist, who did a lot
of data mining for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have two chemistry students,
Josh Pasilli and Anish Adhorti,
[SPEAKER_00]: who were really instrumental in some of
our development of chemical groups that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk to you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so without that, I'll start by
reminding you of the overview of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have on the surface of a plant
cell these pattern recognition receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: or PRRs, that are responsible for
perceiving pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to use the example of
Pseudomonas, which is a bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a flagellum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that flagellum is this
conserved region called micro-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular patterns, or MAMs, that are
perceived by these cell surface receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: and initiate intercellular signaling that
include not kinase cascades and that lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to translational reprogramming that leads
to pattern triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this pattern triggered immunity is
important for inhibiting the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course pathogens have been able to
reserve this system through the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors, specifically type 3 effectors,
that are injected into the plant cell by
[SPEAKER_00]: the type 3 secretion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these effectors, once they're inside
the cell, can then interfere with this
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of ADR-PTOV and ADR-PTO,
two effectors in Pseudomonas that we study
[SPEAKER_00]: in tomato, these specifically inhibit this
pattern recognition receptor complex
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thereby it inhibits pattern
triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now of course the plant has to fight
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in tomato, these two effectors are
recognized by the resistance protein
[SPEAKER_00]: complex PTOV that then leads to effector
triggered immunity and program cell death
[SPEAKER_00]: that then stops the spread of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're specifically studying and
focusing on this very initial events of
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition that's happening on the plant
cell surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in pattern triggered immunity,
we have these cell surface receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are transmembrane receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the majority of them is the ones I'm
showing today, all have intercellular
[SPEAKER_00]: protein kinases and these extracellular
domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before in the last slide I had FLS2,
which is probably the best characterized
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor in plants for immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so FLS2 works with the co-receptor
BAC1 and recognizes FLAG22, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: region of phlejoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is a fairly well conserved
receptor throughout plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are several examples of
receptors that are found in very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: plant groups or families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the case of the EFR receptor that
recognizes L-18, which is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation factor TU of microbes,
this is only found in vasocases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, so these are all examples
of these leucine retro-T receptor like
[SPEAKER_00]: kinases, which are indicated in these
little green domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have other ones, including the
lysine domain containing proteins such as
[SPEAKER_00]: the serps, which recognize chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bring up that this is a new
receptor that was just published yesterday
[SPEAKER_00]: in plant immunology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually recognizes LPS,
little polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its receptor is called LoR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a leptin S domain receptor like
kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's key and what's sort of
conserved in all of these is that
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream, since these are all protein
kinases, they activate kinase cascades.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include transcriptional
reprogramming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all leads to your basal defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to talk a little bit more
about these two peptides called FLAG22
[SPEAKER_00]: that I already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this other new peptide that was only
identified about a year and a half ago
[SPEAKER_00]: from a tomato called FLAG228.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also from flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to step back for a second
and talk a little bit about human
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been known that there's actually
two flagellin receptors in mammalian
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an extracellular receptor called
TLR5 that recognizes one portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have an intracellular protein
complex that recognizes a second portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of cool is actually if you
look at the structure and what the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors seem to recognize, we actually
again have two portions, the FLAG22 region
[SPEAKER_00]: that's recognized by FLS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a second region, FLAG228,
that's recognized by a previously unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, FLS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one early hypothesis when we first
identified this new man was, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: this could actually, both of these
peptides could be recognized by the same
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, the tomato FLS2 could
just be modified in such a way as to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tested the hypothesis pretty early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we could find was, in fact,
when you silence FLS2 and tomato and you
[SPEAKER_00]: treat with FLAG22, you see a reduced
response to this peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no difference when you treat
with the FLAG228 peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this seemed to provide evidence that,
in fact, we have two different receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: in tomato that are recognizing the same
protein but just different portions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you some evidence that
FLAG228 actually is functioning as a MAMP,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it's actually inducing
transcriptional change in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ernon Rosley in our lab actually gave a
talk I think back in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of experiments working with
MAMP-inducers in tomato and looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just want to acknowledge Jay
Worley actually did a reanalysis of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of this data, and that's what I'm showing
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he did is that what we see is that
looking at the number of genes induced in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato upon treatment with FLAG228,
we have more than 2200.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look and divide further
treatments, such as when we treat with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas fluorescens, which is a PTI
inducer, 86% of the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptionally upregulated are
overlapping with the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: upregulated with FLAG228.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this sort of suggests that one of the
major PAMPs in fluorescence is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, FLAG228 treatment is giving us
that same response.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we treat with a disarmed strain of
Pseudomonas fluorescens in half of our
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato GC3000, we see that 90% of the
genes that are upregulated are overlapping
[SPEAKER_00]: again with the FLAG228 induced genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this percentage goes down in the
fully-variable GC3000 because that,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I showed you previously, is sort of
suppressing the PTI induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we don't, if we have a strain
that doesn't deliver effectors and doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a flagellin, it's pretty much
escaping recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really getting an induction of
PTI in these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we looked at this evidence,
this gave us some confidence that FLAG228
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment was inducing a response in
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were interested in maybe
figuring out what was going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I happened to be involved in a project
where we were screening tomato heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars to see if they had variation in
their response to different PAMPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had included FLAG22 and another
peptide CSP22, but I'm showing you here
[SPEAKER_00]: the data for FLAG228 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to emphasize here is we
saw that there was one line, yellow pair,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was tested that seemed to have
really, really reduced responses to
[SPEAKER_00]: FLAG228 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wondered, was this an anomaly?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could we actually find other cultivars
that were in fact having a differential
[SPEAKER_00]: response?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went through and screened about
200 different tomato cultivars and also
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species of tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I could find was actually several
cultivars and a few wild species
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions that had this reduced response
to FLAG228 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, we have this yellow pair
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two pimpinella folium accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the closest relatives to
tomato, but it's a wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had all of these different
tomato cultivars that all showed this
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely reduced response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, when you look at the
response, there really isn't anything
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were very excited and decided
this really set us up for a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics approach where I used a yellow
pair cultivar, the non-responder,
[SPEAKER_00]: as one of my parents and the pimpinella
folium LA1589 as my other parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was really nice is we actually have
the genomes of both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually made the genetics really,
really nice later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have is we actually did a cross
and looked at the phenotype of the F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we see if we treat the FLAG22
for either yellow pair, the other parent,
[SPEAKER_00]: LA1589, or the F1 hybrid, they all respond
equally well to FLAG22.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when we treat the FLAG228,
yellow pair is completely insensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: the peptide, but the LA1589 and the F1
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this set us up to do a bulk
segregate analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed you the phenotype of the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we went to the F2, we had a nice
segregation of the phenotype where we had
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive plants and non-responsive
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we pulled the DNA from the
responsive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was that if we could go and
sequence the genomes, we wanted to look
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for regions of the genomes
where we had SNPs that corresponded to
[SPEAKER_00]: only the yellow pair parent, but not to
the other LA1589 parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because we had the genome
sequences for both of these, this actually
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up being fairly straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is where Suzy comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed this analysis pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to walk you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, again, grouped the susceptible
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we sent the DNA off for next
generation Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Suzy did sequence processing of
that data where she trimmed the reads and
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she mapped those reads onto her
yellow pair genome so that she could call
[SPEAKER_00]: those SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what she ended up doing is
looking for regions where the selenium and
[SPEAKER_00]: pinellia volumes-specific SNPs were
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that allowed us to find some
candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you an example of
what this output data looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for 11 of the 12 chromosomes,
this is generally what the data looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at the percentage of LA1589
SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we see no linkage to our trade
of interest, we should see 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's generally what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you have a little bit of
wiggling in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see is generally a 50% SNP
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, about 11 of the 12
chromosomes look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One chromosome instead had a suppressed
region where we had very very few LA1589
[SPEAKER_00]: SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's right in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this corresponded to about a 2.5
megabase region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the genes there,
we actually found nine receptor-like
[SPEAKER_00]: kinase genes, which was our sort of
candidate protein that we were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at these nine genes,
I then designed primers looking at these
[SPEAKER_00]: different portions of the genome and did a
little bit of fine mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at the recombination,
we saw a suppressed recombination around
[SPEAKER_00]: the region of this one gene, but not
around these other genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we very tentatively called this one
receptor-like kinase gene our putative
[SPEAKER_00]: FLS3 gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomato has been really nice in the last
few years in that we have a lot of genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that have been developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of those resources that's been
developed out of Michigan State is a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: cap sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took a whole bunch of different
tomato cultivars and Pimpinella folium
[SPEAKER_00]: accessions and they did SNP calling
throughout the genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could actually mine this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we looked for was, Suzy first did
a whole genome analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she took all the SNPs from the whole
genome and developed this tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we could do is we had three
cultivars in that list that were
[SPEAKER_00]: non-responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those three cultivars are not related
if you look at the entire genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these are three cultivars that
don't respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just take that region of interest
around 10 megabases around that region,
[SPEAKER_00]: we now see that all of these cultivars now
cluster together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again gave us some, you know,
potential evidence that perhaps this
[SPEAKER_00]: region of the genome was of interest for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could have a common breeding
history or a common lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We next then went to different selenium
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pointed out tomato of course responds
to flight 228 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know potato and pepper also
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Petunia does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have genome sequences of all
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can actually go into the genomes and
ask, well, do they have this one candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: FLS3 gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really interestingly, we have the
tomato FLS3 candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pepper and we have potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look, Petunia and actually
Bencomiana do not have a clear ortholog
[SPEAKER_00]: for this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again was some evidence suggesting
that maybe that this was the gene and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a newly arisen gene that was not
present in, it came about after the
[SPEAKER_00]: divergence of Petunia and Nicosiana from
the selenium species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a whole lot of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get back to the gene, what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has two exons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did is we sequenced all of
those different cultivars to see what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is that in yellow pear,
the six other tomato cultivars and in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Pimpinella folium accessions,
we have four base pair deletion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually the one base pair deletion
is sufficient because that causes an
[SPEAKER_00]: aberrant stalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would predict actually that in
all of these cultivars and accessions,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is actually null.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have one other that was very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Pimpinella folium LA373,
we actually had what appeared to be a full
[SPEAKER_00]: length encoding gene, but there were four
non-synonymous SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually see, if you go
back to the data, we see that this LA373
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really a null.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to have some response,
but it was greatly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was kind of another really
interesting allele for us to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, before all of this,
we have to actually show what is the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it encoding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, it's leucine-richer's P
for septal leucinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has 27 extracellular leucine-richer
P's, a transmembrane domain, and a kinase
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when we go and actually look at
what it looks like on the ectodomain,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you take the FLS2-VAC1-FLY22 co-crystal
structure, and you put the FLS3 gene on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and thread it, it looks very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the actual amino acid
identity, it's only about 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while structurally it looks similar,
because again, the leucine-rich P domains
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty conserved as far as their
structure, the actual amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation is fairly low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, finally, putting it into planta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's nice is I can use those
yellow-pair tomatoes to do some work with
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I first did was express this FLS3
gene into yellow-pair protoplasts to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're able to now signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I just express FLS3,
we don't get any activation in that
[SPEAKER_00]: kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we treat the FLY22 as our control,
we do get activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just treat with the peptide,
we don't get activation either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only when we have the FLS3 plus the
FLY228 that we actually now get activation
[SPEAKER_00]: in that kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a control, if you remember
this EFR and L18 pair, that we can put
[SPEAKER_00]: this in tomato and we also get signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was suggesting to us that the gene
that we had was probably the right gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we wanted to do some further testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we expressed FLS3 in the Cochiana
benthenyana, which you remember from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tree I just showed did not have a clear
FLS3 ortholog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we put in FLS3 in the FLY228,
we get a nice response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we put in the EFR and its cognate
ligand, L18, we also get a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the wrong receptor ligand
pairs, we don't see any response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just expression of FLS3 cause
to aberrancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some nice data that was
suggesting that FLS3 could be the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, but we wanted to do some further
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to this model, what we had
is, as I mentioned, we had this aberrant
[SPEAKER_00]: stop codon in one of our alleles that
really didn't do us very much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had this other nice allele that had
four amino acid changes, three in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leucine-rich repeat domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we looked at that, they weren't
really conserved residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't seem to be really big changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we looked at this fourth one
that's actually in the highly conserved P
[SPEAKER_00]: plus one loop, we're doing a three-needle
proline change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hypothesized it was probably this
amino acid change that was causing this
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in response phenotype that we
were observing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other one I want to mention
is that in kinases, they have a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved ATP binding site that's
important for the actual catalytic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of the kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this case, it's at this lysine
877.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also use this amino acid to probe
the function of FLS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we started making mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking here at total loss
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put in FLS3 into benthamiana and
treat with FLY228, we get response.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I make this ATP binding site mutant,
we lose the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if I make the three-needle
proline substitution that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, we have a reduced response.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of similar to what we were
seeing in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to confirm that, what I actually
did was cloned out the other allele from
[SPEAKER_00]: the LA373, which we call FLS3-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to what we were seeing from
the actual plant, the Pimpinela folium,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a reduction in response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not no response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if we take that allele and we
mutate the proline back to 3D,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can restore wild type function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this told us a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also really implied that the kinase
domain or kinase activity is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the function of FLS3
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next, we wanted to actually show that
we're getting an induction of PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did for these experiments
was we took benthamiana plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we infiltrated the leaves with
agrobacterium that expresses FLS3,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then came back later and treated with
our peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should induce our immune system
immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then came in eight hours later,
and we challenged the plant with our
[SPEAKER_00]: DC3000 in an overlapping circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this allows us to do is that we
look for whether we have cell death in the
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap region.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't, it means that we didn't
induce an immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bacteria won.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were able to induce immunity,
then we don't see cell death in that spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that the plant won.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us to really probe whether
we are getting an immune response from
[SPEAKER_00]: this receptor and treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a horrible picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can sort of see here is that if
we infiltrate with only YFP and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, you see that we actually have
the cell death in the overlapping area the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests, again, that we're not
inducing a clear immune response in that
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take the inactive FLS3, the one that
had the ATP binding mutation, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, also see that we have cell death in
that overlapping area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we have the wild type FLS3,
we don't see that we have any cell death
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was suggesting, again,
that we are getting an immune response
[SPEAKER_00]: that was being initiated when we had FLS3
plus the cognitive variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These screens were done by Diane Dunn in
our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last part, of course, is the effector
story, because that's really what our lab
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been known that the effectors
AVR-PTO and AVR-PTOB suppress FLS2
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not too surprisingly, they also
suppress FLS3 mediated signaling for both
[SPEAKER_00]: AVR-PTO and for AVR-PTOB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something, of course,
we're really interested in exploring in
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg's lab whether this is going to be the
same as what occurs for FLS2 or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I think Teenie and
Simon are going to be working on shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wanted to ask, is FLS3
signaling dependent on BAC1?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, FLS2 signaling is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would expect that it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we needed to do the experiments
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we use benthamiana and we either
have a control silencing or a BAC1
[SPEAKER_00]: silencing, in plants that are silenced for
BAC1 and express FLS3, we have a reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's comparable to what we see through
EFR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was some preliminary evidence BAC1
was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able to recently do in vivo
studies looking at the existence of FLS3
[SPEAKER_00]: and BAC1 in a complex using combative
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I have FLS3 and BAC1 expressed
in the same leaf, if I immunoprecipitate
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling on the BAC1, I'm able to detect
FLS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have YFP instead and pull on YFP,
I don't pull down the FLS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was, again, suggesting that we
were getting FLS3 and BAC1 to exist in a
[SPEAKER_00]: complex together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say this was actually after
treatment with the peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, this is more something else
we're very interested in studying as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so last thing that we needed to do in
order to actually show that this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, the receptor, we had to
demonstrate specific binding between the
[SPEAKER_00]: ligand and the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did this using some chemistry
probes that were developed through
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with Frank Schroeder's lab,
and specifically a current postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh Griselli, and a former postdoc,
Enish O'Doherty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up with these very clever
systems to put on two important chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: moieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is this diazirine
photocrosslinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is this alkyne
chemistry group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made two probes, our FLAG228 and
our FLAG22, that had what we called as our
[SPEAKER_00]: handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this allows us to do is that with
the photodiazirine crosslinker,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use UV light, and this will
covalently attack and bond to whatever's
[SPEAKER_00]: close by.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alkyne handle allows us to do clip
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this allows us to do is
specifically put on a tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it lets us put on a tag after we've
done the experiment, so that the tag
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't interfere with the binding of the
ligand to its receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can show that putting on this
little chemical group, which is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: about one and a half amino acids inside,
so it's not very big, it didn't affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of the probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we wanted to show the binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll walk you through these experiments
because they're a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We first express FLS3 GFP in our
benthamiana leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then harvest microsomes and plasma
membranes to have an enrichment of our
[SPEAKER_00]: protein, and we get rid of a lot of the
contaminated cytosolic proteins,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as our fluorophores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get rid of the fluorophil because
that would soak up the UV radiation and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the downstream analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our microsomes that have our
FLS3 GFP.
[SPEAKER_00]: We add our probe and any competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if our peptide binds to the
receptor, again, this photocrosslinker is
[SPEAKER_00]: now in close proximity so that we can hit
it with UV radiation and it now
[SPEAKER_00]: photocrosslinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we now have a covalent linkage between
our receptor and our ligand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we have a GFP tag, we can do
immunoprecipitation to pull down this
[SPEAKER_00]: complex between the receptor and its
ligand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with this click chemistry handle,
we can add on any tag we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we instead are adding on biotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can use a click chemistry reaction
to add on biotin azide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it allows us to do
immunoblocking, looking for either the GFP
[SPEAKER_00]: or for the biotin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we first could show that the probe
chemistry was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we treat with flag 228 in the
presence of FLS3, we get a biotin label,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can see through the streptavidin
HRP signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have protein in both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flag 22 is not just aberrantly
binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows that our probe chemistry is
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just crosslinking everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could also compete off the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have our probe flag 228 in the
presence of excess unlabeled flag 228,
[SPEAKER_00]: we lose our signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't lose the flag 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would suggest, again, that we had
a very specific receptor ligand
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction between our flag 228 and our
FLS3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we couldn't get rid of this
binding by just adding any old peptide to
[SPEAKER_00]: the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just sort of in summary,
what we have now is we have identified
[SPEAKER_00]: FLS3, which is the receptor for flag 228.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've shown that the signaling involves
BAC1 as a co-receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that activation of the signaling
pathway leads to the activation of matte
[SPEAKER_00]: crinase cascades, as well as
transcriptional reprogramming of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed that the signaling involves the
ROS production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the Pseudomonas syringae
effectors AVRP2 and AVRP2B can come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually suppress the signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, which was very fast,
I'm going to go ahead and just again
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledge everyone in the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, Pat did a lot of the
cross-linking experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zhu Long was really instrumental in some
of the genetics and also the cloning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Susie did all the bioinformatics work,
which was totally essential for this
[SPEAKER_00]: project, as you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh and Inish did the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also worked with Joyce and one of her
techs, Kate, with working with some cell
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also collaborated with Boris
Binnitzer and his student, Chris Clark,
[SPEAKER_00]: who were the ones who originally were
finding the flag 228 molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd be very glad to take
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
