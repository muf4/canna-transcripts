[SPEAKER_13]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we want to make sure that that data is
available to, you know, to these breeders
[SPEAKER_16]: and research communities, also folks that
are engaged in industry developing new
[SPEAKER_16]: technologies like hempcrete.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, we've heard some really cool
applications for hemp material,
[SPEAKER_16]: fiber, different kind of fibers,
geofabrics.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where this where this crop can go.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we we feel very privileged to be
part of the community and to support
[SPEAKER_16]: support these efforts where we can.
[SPEAKER_16]: My specific title is research geneticist.
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently, I think, you know, where we can
really focus our efforts is, as Zach
[SPEAKER_16]: mentioned, these multi-state evaluation
efforts.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we have a couple great
collaborators here, Steven Belouche,
[SPEAKER_16]: Ernie Siebert from Alabama and Oregon
State, and also Larry Smart and Chris
[SPEAKER_16]: Smart from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_16]: Really appreciate and.
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a new from from
Alabama A&M as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Also many other great collaborators.
[SPEAKER_16]: Shelby Ellison here, David Suchoff,
a great research community, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_16]: everyone's able to kind of reach out and
chat with some of these researchers.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think evaluations of this material
across states because some material might
[SPEAKER_16]: do very well in New York, but perform
poorly in Oregon, say, or Alabama and vice
[SPEAKER_16]: versa.
[SPEAKER_16]: There might be some material that looks
horrible in New York, but looks great in
[SPEAKER_16]: Alabama for growers in the in that
southeast region.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that characterization is is so
vitally important of this germplasm.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_16]: Zach's getting, you know, accessions every
day.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes hundreds of accessions will come
in and a lot.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so it's a big, big task to do a
thorough evaluation.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're trying as hard as we can to grow out
these materials and evaluate for many
[SPEAKER_16]: different traits, including fiber quality,
grain quality, and the one that is
[SPEAKER_16]: probably most pressing is secondary
metabolites, looking at THC levels.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as a as a geneticist,
I'm curious what which of these germplasm
[SPEAKER_16]: accession, which of this germplasm has
stable and low THC levels across across
[SPEAKER_16]: these different states so that we can use
those varieties for backcrossing into this
[SPEAKER_16]: diverse germplasm so that we can have
regulatory compliant material that that's
[SPEAKER_16]: available for distribution.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I also want to highlight another
study that we're doing with Chris Mart and
[SPEAKER_16]: Larry's group and Nicole Goche and Bob
Pierce down at the University of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is looking at resistance to a
bunch of really important pathogens that
[SPEAKER_16]: includes powdery mildew, septoria,
downy mildew, and fusarium headlight.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we think that that's going to be
really important data to get out to
[SPEAKER_16]: growers in the research and industry
communities as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: If there are other traits that we that we
haven't mentioned that you think would be
[SPEAKER_16]: really important.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that there was an earlier question
about looking at stem THC concentration
[SPEAKER_16]: that I think we're we're open and willing
to discuss looking at additional traits.
[SPEAKER_16]: This year, we started a root study as
well, because some folks mentioned that
[SPEAKER_16]: roots were very important and looking at
like root bio mass, root morphology.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so your comments help inform where our
research goes and what kind of data gets
[SPEAKER_16]: posted onto Grand Global.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're very excited about this.
[SPEAKER_16]: Very excited to tell folks what we're up
to.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think our our trials are going to
be part of today's activities.
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you'd like to see them at some
point, reach out to us and we can take you
[SPEAKER_16]: on a tour of that of our research trials
just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: A couple miles away from here.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to thank Larry and the Cornell
team for hosting this event.
[SPEAKER_16]: And and please reach out with questions at
any time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And good seeing this group.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nationally in fiber production for
sustainable construction materials.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a lot of interest in Chinese hemp
coming in from China, which grows very
[SPEAKER_05]: well, grows very tall, flowers very late.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's good for fiber production.
[SPEAKER_05]: But every Chinese cultivar or variety,
I call them land races that we have
[SPEAKER_05]: tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has tested hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know the genetics of THC production.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know why they test hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the genes for THC production have
not been bred out of those Chinese
[SPEAKER_05]: variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have done that in our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Luis is going to talk about those
lines as well as all the varieties that
[SPEAKER_05]: you see here that he is evaluating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we if we can if you can think
about how we can get people moving down to
[SPEAKER_05]: our next stop, which is down by the farm
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we get our blood flowing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Luis has about 40 minutes to describe
all of this stuff here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, 30 minutes plus questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks much, Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I would like to pass on some
samples for you guys to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the genetics of the seeds
that we are we have currently in our
[SPEAKER_02]: general collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see different seed sizes and what
happens when you extract the hemp hearts
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get the hearts and the holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also see breast oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will see this gunk at the bottom
is because it was whole seed breast oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't just the heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just pass around so people can take a
look at those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so today I want to cover the
small plot trial, which encompasses 12
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber cultivars, you can see on my right,
and 18 dual purpose cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: In total, we have a 26 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are trialed in both dual and
fiber to see which production system works
[SPEAKER_02]: best for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, I started my talk last
year with this question, who here is
[SPEAKER_02]: wearing or having any fire derived
product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad that people are utilizing the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I hear I think I'm very confident
that most of you know what fiber is,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it comes from, and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just a quick reminder, so make sure
that we're on the same page.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from the outer the cortex,
which is like the bust called bust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the inner body part, also called
the herd, is what is used for hempcrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: for pulp, for paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be used for animal bedding,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure that we're all on the same
page, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to tell you like how to
grow fiber specifically or like the
[SPEAKER_02]: anatomy or the physiology of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of you already know more or
less what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But rather, I would like to tell you the
importance of what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I think it would be best if
I can start from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1912, Mr. Dewey was the first,
well, this is claimed to be the first hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started working around Minnesota,
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those cultivars were named based on
like the origin of those genoplasms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is Kimmington, Kentucky,
Minnesota, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chimmington, China, or Chimton,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: China, Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's Ferramington, which is a
Italian land race and a
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington-originated population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can tell the assessment of hemp
genoplasm has happened a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he already evaluated multiple
genoplasms for different origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can tell that what we're doing is
not nothing new, but rather necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So later, in 1925, despite the prohibition
that happened in the US, that didn't mean
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp breeding stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: He carried on in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: This researcher called Gustav Bretherman,
he worked on improving past content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very interesting to read this
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in German, so I had to translate a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully I'm conveying the right
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was able to improve this past content
that I was talking about, from 9% to 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about 2.5 to 3 full
increase in past content.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, other researchers were
able to find the first Monitius
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals in 1930s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, Dr. Gustav Bretherman had a
successor, and in his paper, in 1952,
[SPEAKER_02]: suggested or indicated that this successor
will use these first Monitius cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: and combine them with these high quality
cultivars that Dr. Bretherman developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see how the hemp breeding has
been going on, and what you are seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now may have been originated from a
long time ago, but from those researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later, in 1946, Walter Hoffman,
another researcher, German researcher,
[SPEAKER_02]: identified what he called Bright Stem
Mutation, which is a yellow stem that you
[SPEAKER_02]: may see on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eventually, the need of ease of the
cultivation in the industry elicited the
[SPEAKER_02]: Dutch researchers to release four
cultivars, among which there is this
[SPEAKER_02]: called Chameleon and Ivory, which are
well-researched yellow stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are yellow stem cultivars,
and there are papers from 2018,
[SPEAKER_02]: very recently and from this year,
that suggest the ease of the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher bus content compared to a green
stem cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, as you can see, what we are
doing is not new, but rather necessary,
[SPEAKER_02]: and is where we are right now,
and is a guide of where we should go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bringing it back to us as a summary,
there was a first breeder in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: using some recurrent phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some researchers in Germany
improving bus content, others finding
[SPEAKER_02]: first muntitius, others finding bright
stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's bring it to current modern time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the bus content that we see,
is about 25%, 35% bus content.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this year, I read a paper
claiming, from Lithuania, claiming a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar having 42.23% bus, which is
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it's true, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see that these cultivars are
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mentioned Lithuania, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to assess yellow plasma for
different locations to see what performs
[SPEAKER_02]: best, and if it doesn't, what traits can
we take advantage of so that it works here
[SPEAKER_02]: with other yellow plasma that's more
adapted to here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that reason, you have yellow plasma
here that is the issue, that is muntitius,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is yellow, that is thin stem,
the stick stem, and then we have dual
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does any of you know the current or the
average yield in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: for fiber or grain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't know that either,
so I didn't get up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just talked about Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also eat hemp hearts every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so in Canada, it's about a thousand
kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, bringing it back to the distance,
you may understand, it's 750, 190 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: In average, with dry lands and irrigated,
I have two different reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for fiber, in a fiber production system
alone, instead of dual, it's 2.4 to 4.8
[SPEAKER_02]: tons per acre, U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: tons per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for dual, it's 0.3 to 0.6 tons per
acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I telling you all these numbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have handouts of our yield,
our projected yield from these small-pro
[SPEAKER_02]: trials, and what we can achieve if we
extend this from a small-pro trial to a
[SPEAKER_02]: larger scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted you to have those numbers as a
reference when you look into those
[SPEAKER_02]: handouts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, another thing I wanted to say
is, well, hemp produces fiber,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's another crop that produces
fiber that is widely grown, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A paper in 2020 assessed the comparison
between hemp fiber and cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp fiber, on average, produces three
times more fiber per acre than,
[SPEAKER_02]: or per area, actually, than cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more environmentally friendly,
particularly, and it reduces costs in
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural production, or agricultural
activities, rather, of 77.7%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the numbers are out there, and the
potential is out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have 12 fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also have the handouts,
so you can freely walk around and look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like this rep, please go to
other reps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four reps in a randomized,
complete block design.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each rep is a block, and all the
cultivars are randomized within that block
[SPEAKER_02]: of those four blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spoke a lot, so let me just pause a
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions so far?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the seeding rates for the fiber
and dual purpose approach system?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will vary because of germination
rate, seed size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't like particular numbers because
you may not have the specific target plant
[SPEAKER_02]: density that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I can tell you is the ideal plant
density or the target plant density,
[SPEAKER_02]: for dual purpose, that would be 12 plants
per square meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for fiber, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per square foot, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for fiber, it would be 30 plants per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I mistaken?
[SPEAKER_02]: 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you should go by the target
plant density and then just based on
[SPEAKER_02]: germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious what you did for weed control
and how these plots were prepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you did moldboard plow or just
tarrowing, did you do any cover crop
[SPEAKER_08]: testing and any regenerative farming?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any chemicals, any manual cultivation?
[SPEAKER_08]: What has this done in all this?
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't spray any herbicide at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we had a cover crop here
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the field was in corn last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a lot of corn roots.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And watering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you water it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rain fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's no watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just at the very beginning,
weed or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: No irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just regular mechanization around
the edges.
[SPEAKER_08]: Around the edges, no in-row.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No mechanization at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a very good point that you bring
up because based on the genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have different leaf sizes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can create a canopy culture very
early in the season preventing any weed
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another trait that we're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would like to say is the seedling
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: How bigger is a plant very early in the
season to reach that kind of enclosure so
[SPEAKER_02]: then you don't have any competition with
the weeds later on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one follow-up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, unrelated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another question, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lignin, have you been tracking or testing
lignin content?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at Harvest, we harvest one square
meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that square meter encompasses all
the stems there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we will later rep that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, we will mill that material
and analyze the cellulose, hemicellulose,
[SPEAKER_02]: lignin, and effecting content.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you call the herds, the shifts,
do you call that fiber?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't refer to it as fiber.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filler?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I heard chives.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we say fiber grain, but the fiber is
more herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's 70% herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But depends how you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're harvesting dual purpose,
that will be mostly herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea here is before you reach
flowering, you will get mostly bass,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will be the same proportion,
but sorry, the proportion will be much
[SPEAKER_02]: less.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll still have more herd.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to get those really high levels of
bass fiber that you're talking about
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier, that's not going to be textile
grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be good for non-wovens,
but I think for textile grade fibers,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to harvest it earlier,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not fully lignified.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you might only see less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no market for textile grade
fibers, but this is the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think there's a market in North
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is to harvest hard flowering
to maximize the bass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as long as you get the long
fiber, which are the primary bass,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are long enough for spinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer you let them mature,
it will be shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then for spinning, that would be very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we have to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the plant density is much
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the inter-plant competition,
so that triggers more growth among plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have longer inter-nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have finer, I mean, many papers from
Europe claim that the higher the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: density, the finer the fibers you get,
the nutrition as well, although that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit difficult because you have to
be careful with nutrition.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lewis, could you talk about your planting
dates as to if you can have, well,
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe not here, but multiple crops in one
year, or do you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Great question.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Try that into the flowering time and
latitude a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was if I could elaborate
more on the planting date.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the whole process of seed to harvest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole time frame from seed
proceeding to harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the handout, you will see two
planting dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this entire field was planted on May
18.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a second planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way down there, when we walk
towards the end of this field,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will see four blocks as the second
planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for the fiber plot, that was on
June 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a dual plot, that was on June 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why they were spaced out is
because we don't have rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flowering time, if you see in the
handouts, you have different flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have different criterion for each
fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for fiber, I harvest it when the plant
reaches 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that way, I maximize yield and I
minimize my loss in quality of fiber.
[SPEAKER_02]: For dual, I harvest between six to seven
weeks after about 85% of the plants have
[SPEAKER_02]: flowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that way, I minimize seed
shattering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I maximize maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also depends on the bear pressure
you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the planting date is a good question
because in the industry's claim that a
[SPEAKER_02]: crop is X days and 100 days, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the handout,
I can tell you the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may be, that might as well be
because of environmental cues,
[SPEAKER_02]: or yeah, in this case, more specifically
for a period, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: However, another thing that I want to
mention is that in Europe, in 2008,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a paper talking about growing
degree days, how another crop is commonly
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This paper was later evaluated again in
2012, validated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, no one has touched that
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one has touched those formulas that
they came up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those cultivars that they use
for that model are growing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm doing, like these two planting
dates, is to see the environmental effect
[SPEAKER_02]: on these cultivars planted very early and
late, and to see how they fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that flowering time should
tell you is the how homogeneous the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the handout,
some plants will start flowering from 1%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 50% or from 1% to 100% at different
rates, depending on when they are planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may also be explained by the
growing degree days in this model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to explore that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to look into that and which
cultivars abide by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of using x amount of days
based on, I don't know what they're basing
[SPEAKER_02]: on, but a growing degree days formula
would be a better indicator to determine
[SPEAKER_02]: when to flower so you can schedule your
equipment and all the processing and so
[SPEAKER_02]: forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I am very certain that not all
cultivars will abide by that model because
[SPEAKER_02]: of heavy genetic effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: X-59 is one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will flower about 2030.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in the handout, you'll see that
it's not good color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I worked really hard to put those data
together for you to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_02]: those numbers and to see the distinction
between these and to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually your website says 100 and
something, but maybe this is not so much
[SPEAKER_02]: in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, everything changes the lower latitude
that you go to plant these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned insecticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: David.
[SPEAKER_18]: Please.
[SPEAKER_18]: Variety trials are a lot of fun because
there's so much genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you probably know these people better
than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_18]: So which is your favorite variety in life?
[SPEAKER_02]: So David is saying that I know this plot
better than anybody, and that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which one is my favorite cultivar or
variety, and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably how.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, question.
[SPEAKER_02]: 231143 is our breeding line.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look around, one thing that you
will notice is the lodging.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is lodging going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: 231143 is the one that's standing very
strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another particular trait of this breeding
line is the seed size.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have seen the seeds on the sample
that I gave you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the seeds are massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, you have garden seed size
comparable to soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find that very appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an agronomist, that's a very
enticing agronomic trait that I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: pursue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will be the late flower and trait
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that breeding line has a
potential for either a tool purpose or a
[SPEAKER_02]: fire cultivar in this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Were all these varieties for this
latitude, or did you grow some that were
[SPEAKER_08]: for other latitudes just to see?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the latter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the question is, if I decided to use
or to test this cultivar based on their
[SPEAKER_02]: outer related to this region, or I was
just testing like overall, all of it on
[SPEAKER_02]: your plasma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so I tested, we decided to test
cultivars from different regions,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably northern than our latitude from
where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, our breeding lines are being
tested across the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have trials here, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one in North Carolina that David
is helping us phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one in Kentucky, which is managed
by Dr. Paul Pierce.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one in Texas by Dr. Calvin
Trussell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one in Homestead, Florida,
my advisor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing, and you can see in the
handout actually, that our breeding lines
[SPEAKER_02]: are performing competitively in these
other latitudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different yields and phenotypical
agronomic traits that can be affected or
[SPEAKER_02]: not affected by the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the main factor there is the photo
period, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the main factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was delighted to hear you're from
Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been to Ecuador many times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've started the process of educating the
government there in 2013.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then realized that, well, there's not
really any varieties that will do well in
[SPEAKER_08]: the 12-12 light cycle for stock and grain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not for now, but that's what I was leading
to is, is this something, have you tried,
[SPEAKER_08]: have you brought genetics there?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've brought genetics to Ecuador and grown
and seen that only get this tall and go to
[SPEAKER_08]: flower, whereas here they get 20 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lab mates are actually, oh,
the question is if we have tested or
[SPEAKER_02]: brought germ plasma from latitudes close
to the equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we can see this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but my lab mates are working on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not actually participating in this,
but there is some work on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't brought anything in this myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious to say that the larger seed
size is attractive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Larger seed size, less seeds per pound,
higher planting weights per acre to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the same stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Production costs could go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess what's attractive from your
perspective about the larger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, why am I so attracted
to the seed size given that it would mean
[SPEAKER_02]: less seeds per pound and a higher cost for
seeding and establishment?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew I'm going to be asked that
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my counter argument to that is the
strong seedling vigor of this germ plasma
[SPEAKER_02]: that will ensure canopy closure much
earlier than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, you may require less
seed to get the same stand count compared
[SPEAKER_02]: to a small seeded cultivar that you
require more seeds to reach canopy closure
[SPEAKER_02]: that will eventually lead to self
thinning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be losing money by the self
thinning individuals of those extra seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is my hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to test that next year to be
more accurate, but just based on
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes, but also the seed size per
genotype.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also a great parent material when you
breed it with others.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you can see a complete variation in
seed size and you can actually select an
[SPEAKER_11]: idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is, if there is variation
in seed size that actually I can take
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of and develop cultivar for,
for example, small seeded cultivars for
[SPEAKER_02]: fiber production and large seeded
cultivars for dual fiber production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got ahead of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a MAPI population in which we're
comparing two genotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are crosses, it's an F2 population
in which there are a lot of traits that
[SPEAKER_02]: are irrigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the difference between the parents is
astounding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 50 grams, thousand seed weight
compared to five grams, thousand seed
[SPEAKER_02]: weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Mendel right?
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there could be some major effect genes
that can be used and we can select for
[SPEAKER_02]: specific genoplasm that are small seeded
or large seeded as long as Mendel was
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is so that that can help us
develop markers and then we can put it
[SPEAKER_02]: into our toolkit to, you know,
better genoplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, 2013-143, I've been like still
working on it and there are half seed
[SPEAKER_02]: families in this segregation for seed
size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason why I was saying earlier
that from 2013-143 I can develop fiber and
[SPEAKER_02]: dual is because I've seen this segregation
and I could do phenotypic, recurrent
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic selection to determine,
oh, these genotypes will be better for
[SPEAKER_02]: dual and this will be for fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom line is that F1 and the F2
generation of that cross between large
[SPEAKER_05]: seeded and very small seeded is right in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an additive trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mendel was wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would have expected, right,
if it were dominant, either large or
[SPEAKER_05]: small, but it's clearly a quantitative
additive trait that's going to take a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of time to breed back.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to intergress those traits and
get large seed or small seed, it's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to take a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, kind of as a follow-up to Trey's
question, how strong is the relationship
[SPEAKER_06]: between large seeds and high-grade?
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine you're playing this game where
you have fewer larger seeds versus a
[SPEAKER_06]: greater number of smaller seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that come out in the wash in
terms of overall yield rate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is there just not a strong
relationship?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe as we're walking down, maybe people
can sample a particular variety and look
[SPEAKER_05]: at seed size.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you elaborate on your question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how strong is the relationship between
yield per acre of grain with seed size?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I imagine there's a game where you
can have a fewer number of large seeds or
[SPEAKER_06]: a greater number of smaller seeds,
perhaps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that a tight relationship?
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you observed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the handout, I put together the
yield data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should start walking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put together a yield data.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_15]: I am the plant pathologist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Generally, people are not enthusiastic
about being the plant pathologist because,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we deal with rotten plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're here to tell you that we are
also working to deal with producing a
[SPEAKER_15]: healthier stand more quickly.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in my lab for hemp, we have people
working on, Patrick is working on root rot
[SPEAKER_15]: issues, which he'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have another student working on septoria
leaf spot, which is among the biggest leaf
[SPEAKER_15]: spot issues here in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_15]: Given the humidity and rain that we have.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I have a student that's working
on downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, that's a water mold that can be
really problematic, especially if it gets
[SPEAKER_15]: established early in the season and we
have a wet season.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally, together with the
breeding program, we have a large group of
[SPEAKER_15]: folks working on powdery mildew,
which can be an issue in the field,
[SPEAKER_15]: but is absolutely an issue in high tunnel
and greenhouse ground crops.
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, we have identified a source
of resistance or technically lack of
[SPEAKER_15]: susceptibility to powdery mildew that's
now in the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am hopeful as a plant pathologist
that the breeding program will breed all
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars to be resistant to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how much influence I'll have.
[SPEAKER_15]: But today I would like to introduce my PhD
student, Patrick McMullen, and he's going
[SPEAKER_15]: to talk to you about a seed treatment
study that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_15]: He'll start with talking about the
importance of it and then move into some
[SPEAKER_15]: of the results and where we're going with
it in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been talking a lot about above
ground traits of hemp this morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Louder.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can't really have a healthy plant
without a healthy root system to support
[SPEAKER_07]: that above ground growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're interested in focusing on
promoting early establishment,
[SPEAKER_07]: high densities by promoting good root
growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a number of soil borne pathogens
that can infect root systems and prevent
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good root establishment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are among the water molds,
Pythium.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many species of Pythium can cause damping
off where you have early seedling death.
[SPEAKER_07]: This pathogen will enter the root system
and essentially decay the cortex of the
[SPEAKER_07]: roots where the outer roots will just slop
off and die, leading to total plant
[SPEAKER_07]: collapse.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also fungal pathogens among
Fusarium species and others that will
[SPEAKER_07]: cause root diseases in older mature
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fungal hyphae can grow into the root
system, clog the vasculature, and prevent
[SPEAKER_07]: water flow to those upper shoots of the
plant, which are going to cause your
[SPEAKER_07]: plants to wilt and eventually die.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our goal here in this study was to see
if we can promote the plant to root well
[SPEAKER_07]: early in its life cycle by applying a
fungicide seed treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here, this is all in the handout.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be passing around some images of
root diseases that you can look at what I
[SPEAKER_07]: was just discussing, where you can see the
reddish-brown discoloration on the roots,
[SPEAKER_07]: small root growth, and then necrosis and
wilting and plant collapse on the shoots
[SPEAKER_07]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the experiment here that we're standing
in front of, we used four different
[SPEAKER_07]: fungicide seed treatments and a
non-treatment control.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there were two copper products,
Americop and Ultum, and a phosphite and
[SPEAKER_07]: phosphate product, Prudent 44 and Neutral.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we also included a conventional
control of Aprin and Maxim, a combination
[SPEAKER_07]: of two different fungicides.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these were applied to two different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: We included Fiber 79 and Futura 83.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the treatments are on both
cultivars, and this is organized in a
[SPEAKER_07]: randomized complete block design.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the treatments can be found on the,
if you scan the QR code here, on the field
[SPEAKER_07]: map.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you scroll to the bottom, it will say
seed treatments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can look at the, and yes,
but there's the specific field map.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could look at which treatments are
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the study, I collected stand count
data at several time points throughout the
[SPEAKER_07]: growing season.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see, it's not harvested
yet, so we don't have that final data.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're looking at these numbers
here, we can see that both Ultum and
[SPEAKER_07]: Prudent 44 and Neutral significantly
increased the average number of seedlings
[SPEAKER_07]: per plot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these were just a sample of a one meter
quadrat section from each plot where we
[SPEAKER_07]: counted the average number of seeds per
tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the treatments did numerically
improve the stand count density.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Maricop and Aprin and Maxim treatments
here weren't significantly greater than
[SPEAKER_07]: the non-tree control, but we still did see
a pretty large numeric increase there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these continued at the next time point
that we measured as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is some optimism here that these
seed treatments do improve our stand
[SPEAKER_07]: counts and plant establishment here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon, I will be collecting harvest data.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be measuring biomass and fiber
quality and content to assess how these
[SPEAKER_07]: seed treatments correlate to yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to answer the question,
if we see an increase in stand count,
[SPEAKER_07]: as we're seeing from these data on the
sheet that you have now, does that
[SPEAKER_07]: correlate to yield at the end of the
season?
[SPEAKER_07]: So are we still seeing that improvement in
yield, or can improving the stand count
[SPEAKER_07]: allow us to reduce the seeding density
that we're using?
[SPEAKER_07]: So using less seed, but maybe using a seed
treatment to help us out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's a lot of potential
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to repeat this experiment next
year as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would like to include a biologic
treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the treatments that we used this year
were just copper, phosphite, and
[SPEAKER_07]: conventional fungicide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two of those, Maricop and Ultum,
are organic products.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other two are not.
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them are labeled on hemp yet,
but there is some of that works in the
[SPEAKER_07]: process for several of these products.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we would like to expand this work
further next year to include biological
[SPEAKER_07]: products to- We'll for sure have a
bacillus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we will have a bacillus
amyloquipations product to test,
[SPEAKER_07]: just to give growers more options and
different strategies for control.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I would like to take any
questions you might have about seed
[SPEAKER_07]: treatments or diseases, diseases in
general.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question was how expensive is the
seed treatment or is it cost effective?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have those data yet because we
can't correlate it to yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, do you have any idea how
much it would cost?
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, but it's such a small volume that
generally seed treatments tend to be more
[SPEAKER_15]: cost effective than treatments once plants
are established.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially if the cost of hemp seed is
so high that if we can reduce the number
[SPEAKER_07]: of seeds needed by applying a seed
treatment, that could be a great way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We will have those data probably by the
end of next year after we have enough
[SPEAKER_14]: reps.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, so more information on that to come.
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the current seed cost?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the question is what is the price of
seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a number of seed salespeople
here who can answer that question to you
[SPEAKER_05]: directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sarah Mitchell of King's AgroSeed is
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Korby Middeth of Kanopi US is here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Korby.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say our goal as a plant
breeder, and we can talk to Trey,
[SPEAKER_05]: Trey asked a good question to Luis,
is probably $3 a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, then you have to think about
your seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're seeding for grain production at 25
pounds per acre, but for fiber we're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeding some at 100 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are important economic questions
we need to work out with our agronomists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me just follow up Patrick's talk
by saying here that in many of these small
[SPEAKER_05]: plot trials, and we've done these with
collaborators, academic collaborators
[SPEAKER_05]: across the country, Ernie is a good
example, we rarely see greater than 50%
[SPEAKER_05]: seed establishment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're seeding at a live seed rate based
on germination tests, and then coming out
[SPEAKER_05]: and doing stand counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we rarely see more than 50% of those
live seeds turning into an established
[SPEAKER_05]: seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: A good portion of that is probably due to
soil borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the work that Patrick's doing is
critical to increase that rate of stand
[SPEAKER_05]: establishment because 50% of this seed
that you're growing doesn't turn into,
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're planting doesn't turn into a
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you have to plant twice as many
seeds to get the stand that you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not economical either.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I would have said in the
industry that, again, four years ago,
[SPEAKER_05]: one of our biggest problems was getting
high quality seed at high germination
[SPEAKER_05]: rate, because it was all coming in from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we were always the last
thought, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that we have folks like Corby
bringing in hemp varieties from France in
[SPEAKER_05]: a timely manner and storing it properly,
and now we have domestic seed production
[SPEAKER_05]: from companies like International Hemp,
and good Canadian seed from UniSeeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: Verve, and New West Genetics, all
domestically produced.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we now have overcome that barrier
in terms of the quality of seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you, when you buy a seed lot and
expect it to be 90% germination rate,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get that now, whereas you couldn't
get that four years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we need to move on to these other
problems like, you know, seed treatments
[SPEAKER_05]: and getting herbicides approved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's our next topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to introduce Vipin Kumar,
who is our new field crop wheat scientist
[SPEAKER_05]: at Cornell, to talk about how we finally
have an herbicide product labeled and
[SPEAKER_05]: registered for hemp that we can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, our wheat scientist
here at Agritech, Lynn Sosnowski,
[SPEAKER_05]: could not join us.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's at a conference in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Vipin is going to quickly present some
encouraging results from Lynn's group,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Larry.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you guys doing so far?
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.
[SPEAKER_20]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, as Larry mentioned, I'm a new to
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a new wheat scientist with the field
crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a counterpart here, Dr. Lynn
Sosnowski, who has been actively leading
[SPEAKER_20]: some of wheat management program in hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit about my background.
[SPEAKER_20]: Before joining Cornell, I was with Kansas
State for more than five years.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was working in Western Kansas in
noted dry land agriculture, mainly working
[SPEAKER_20]: with crops like sorghum, wheat,
dry land corn, soybean, as well as the
[SPEAKER_20]: sunflower and a lot of fallow ground.
[SPEAKER_20]: As you know, in high plains, the moisture
is limited and fallow based cropping
[SPEAKER_20]: system is predominant.
[SPEAKER_20]: As you know, no till dry land.
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not you're not able to do a
tillage.
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're relying on herbicides for wheat
control.
[SPEAKER_20]: And repeated use of herbicides or the
dacquets has created a problem like
[SPEAKER_20]: herbicide resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: So my role was there to come up with the
strategies to tackle those herbicide
[SPEAKER_20]: resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: So jumping into Cornell, I'm going to go
and do kind of the same things in terms of
[SPEAKER_20]: developing wheat management programs in
field crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: So part of my responsibilities here is to
come up with sustainable wheat control
[SPEAKER_20]: strategies in field crops, including corn,
soybean, alfalfa, as well as small grains.
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I said, I'm six months old in
Cornell and not aware about this new crop
[SPEAKER_20]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: But Lynn kind of gave me quite an overview
of what's going on in terms of wheat
[SPEAKER_20]: control.
[SPEAKER_20]: And you guys might have a handout here.
[SPEAKER_20]: What has been going on in terms of wheat
control research in Cornell AgriTech here
[SPEAKER_20]: in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_20]: Just a few very foundational points I like
to hammer as I do with other crops is as
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, hemp compared to other crops is
a relatively new crop.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't have many options.
[SPEAKER_20]: When I say options, I talk about herbicide
options.
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have many herbicide options to go
with for wheat control.
[SPEAKER_20]: But fortunately, work from Dr. Lynn
Sosnowski and other colleagues from USDA,
[SPEAKER_20]: we were able to have a supplemental label
with one of the herbicide in the New York
[SPEAKER_20]: this year.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that herbicide is a sonaline from
Govan Company.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you know, or most of you know probably
a group three or root growth inhibitors,
[SPEAKER_20]: this herbicide belongs to group three,
you know, herbicide site of factions.
[SPEAKER_20]: So ethylfluoroline is the active and it is
a label for both type of hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: And the rate is 1.5 to three pints.
[SPEAKER_20]: per acre and you can, you know,
select the rate based on your soil type as
[SPEAKER_20]: well as, you know, other conditions.
[SPEAKER_20]: So one important thing about the sonaline
is a pre and you know, pre plant applied
[SPEAKER_20]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_20]: So you probably have to incorporate this
herbicide when you applying that.
[SPEAKER_20]: And that can be done with the irrigation
or rainfall or you know, if there's no
[SPEAKER_20]: rainfall or no irrigation available,
you probably have to do that incorporation
[SPEAKER_20]: mechanically.
[SPEAKER_20]: So incorporation is very, very important.
[SPEAKER_20]: And this group is basically a root growth
inhibitor, as I said, target majority of
[SPEAKER_20]: the grass species, grass species,
including barnyard or crab grass,
[SPEAKER_20]: but also has activity on broad leaves like
pigweeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the good news.
[SPEAKER_20]: In the hemp industry that we have a
herbicide which you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_20]: use for wheat control.
[SPEAKER_20]: And in general, wheat control,
why wheat control is important in hemp,
[SPEAKER_20]: as you know, just like other crops,
if you allow weeds to grow, especially in
[SPEAKER_20]: the early season, like within one to four
weeks after planting or transplanting,
[SPEAKER_20]: you're gonna see the impact on the yield
as well as the quality in the hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: So early season competition is really,
really critical.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've been hearing from Larry and
others, you know, very good work in terms
[SPEAKER_20]: of breeding lines, developing trades for
good agronomic trades.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would also probably see collaborations
and work with Larry and others in the
[SPEAKER_20]: futures to see if we have some potential
and opportunities to select some lines
[SPEAKER_20]: that has a competitive advantage compared
to the weeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we need those lines, we need
those, you know, cultivars having a
[SPEAKER_20]: competitive advantage than weeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: So other than that, you know, that handout
also covers a lot of cultural practices,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, very, you know, understandable
things we can do to avoid weeds,
[SPEAKER_20]: basically preventive measures,
you know, don't grow hemp in fields where,
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, there is a lot of seed bank,
weed seed bank, basically selective weeds.
[SPEAKER_20]: Weed, weed free, weed, you know,
proper timing, planting time.
[SPEAKER_20]: I see there's been three timings for some
of these varieties have been planted.
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that is a good approach to
optimize that proper timing because some
[SPEAKER_20]: of these competitive weeds are also coming
at that time.
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you have a proper timing,
you can avail the opportunity to control
[SPEAKER_20]: those weeds before you plant your crop.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let those weeds come and then you control
with some sort of burn down or some other
[SPEAKER_20]: methods of weed control and then plant.
[SPEAKER_20]: So site selections, planting time,
seeding rate, a lot of interest in seeding
[SPEAKER_20]: rates and why large seed and versus small
seed.
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess Larry made a good point having a
good rigor, uniform germination,
[SPEAKER_20]: uniform emergence is really critical when
we are dealing with early season weed
[SPEAKER_20]: competition so that you have a good canopy
of the crop that can express the weeds
[SPEAKER_20]: early in the season.
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, you know, cultural practices,
control weeds in rotational crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the major hurdle in terms of hemp,
we don't know much about the crop
[SPEAKER_20]: tolerance or crop plant back restrictions
from most of the chemicals we use in our
[SPEAKER_20]: traditional crops, things like in corn and
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is a big, big hurdle to really
bring more herbicide options into the crop
[SPEAKER_20]: or use herbicide in rotational crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would say select integrated approach,
integrated weed management approach,
[SPEAKER_20]: rely on other options like cultural
practices as well as mechanical practices.
[SPEAKER_20]: You can rely on some sort of interrow
cultivation, interrow mowing if you have
[SPEAKER_20]: planted those hemp in standard rows.
[SPEAKER_20]: Along with the, you know, herbicide,
maybe in rotational crops, once in a while
[SPEAKER_20]: if you can.
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are kind of the major points I
had.
[SPEAKER_20]: Any question you guys have for me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there going to be different herbicides
you can use based on different market
[SPEAKER_09]: classes?
[SPEAKER_09]: So say you can use one for fiber and grain
production, but not one for cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: production.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wish the question is if there are
going to be herbicide options available
[SPEAKER_20]: for different classes, for example,
for fiber or for grain or for other types.
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I wish and everybody wish that
that is the case.
[SPEAKER_20]: But in case of herbicides labeling and
registrations, there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_20]: interest from the industry standpoint
because of the smaller industry,
[SPEAKER_20]: the hemp industry, I'm saying,
as well as the crop tolerance and the crop
[SPEAKER_20]: plant back restrictions.
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, there has been some work with
IR4 has been going on, looking at other
[SPEAKER_20]: options, other tools, herbicide tools.
[SPEAKER_20]: And Lynn mentioned that there's quite a
good results with the Kizalafob class one
[SPEAKER_20]: herbicides for grass control.
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, you know, where that stands in
terms of registrations still in the
[SPEAKER_20]: future.
[SPEAKER_20]: Similarly, she has been looking to look at
some of the group 15s,
[SPEAKER_20]: S-metolachlorocetochlor type materials in
conjunction with sonaline so that you can
[SPEAKER_20]: extend the residual activity for season
long weed control.
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, those are non-label herbicides
in the hemp.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess there's more work needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other question?
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Question is, if I'm doing any work with
the inter planting, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_20]: As I said, I'm just developing my program.
[SPEAKER_20]: And my major role is in field crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: And when I was thinking of hemp,
especially for green type, I think that
[SPEAKER_20]: falls probably under field crops.
[SPEAKER_20]: And yeah, I have not done any work.
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe Larry has any any information on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just talking with Sarah Mitchell and
she's working on system in Pennsylvania
[SPEAKER_05]: planting a nurse crop with hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think you also want to talk to
Professor Ginny Moore in plant breeding at
[SPEAKER_05]: Cornell, who is breeding cover crops and I
think has been looking at planting hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: into cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to touch on your question,
if you are growing for CBD or high THC
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, that tissue will be tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those tests often include a test for
pesticide residue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there may well be a different herbicide
regime that you're going to use for CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp or cannabis versus grain and fiber
based on that tissue residue test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any soil testing before the
crop was planted and after to see was it
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, some chemicals were
detrimental to the soil and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is about doing pre planting
soil testing in particular to look for any
[SPEAKER_05]: elements in the soil or pesticide residues
perhaps that might get into your crop that
[SPEAKER_05]: I would highly recommend that doing that
for CBD hemp again, because of the post
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest testing regimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although we do not have a good
understanding, for example, at the levels
[SPEAKER_05]: of cadmium in the soil that may lead to
high levels of cadmium in the floral
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a great question about doing those
tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by my understanding, we don't have
good predictive ability to say how the
[SPEAKER_05]: results of those tests will end up in
residues in your harvested crop,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do know is that hemp can be very
tolerant of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the thing because it can suck
up heavy metals out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to the biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use it for construction,
for example, are we storing those heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals inside the walls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question, again, is if you test and
observe high levels of cadmium in the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil, will that cadmium end up in the
stems and then end up in your hemp creek?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm focusing on cadmium because that
is probably the main element that hemp is
[SPEAKER_05]: good at taking up heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of heavy metals and hemp
is not going to take up all of those heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: metals, but cadmium is one in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we made a little demonstration of
sonilin here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We planted this little trial on August
3rd.
[SPEAKER_05]: And between their two replicate strips,
the blue was not treated with sonilin.
[SPEAKER_05]: The yellow strips were treated with two
pints per acre of sonilin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lynn surveyed those plots, I think,
three weeks after planting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was no significant difference in
the weed competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's mainly because the main weed
that we had coming up was field
[SPEAKER_05]: pennycress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sonilin specifically says on the label
that it does not control field pennycress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, again, highlights that we need a
range of methods, as Vipin said,
[SPEAKER_05]: an integrated weed management approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it all starts with keeping weeds out
of your fields for the start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Larry, one question, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned diseases and weeds and
everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys have any, have experienced
any problem with insects?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, do we have any insect
pests?
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we have been working with,
started working with Elson Shields,
[SPEAKER_05]: who was our field crops entomologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more recently have been working with
Marion Zufli and Integrated Pest
[SPEAKER_05]: Management, who have been doing insect
surveys for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, we do not have any
insect pests that are causing economic
[SPEAKER_05]: damage in New York after several years of
surveys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen aphids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we see aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see cannabis aphids in the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our conclusion at this point is that
it is not causing economic damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these fields have been tilled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have not done much work on no
till.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much emphasis are you looking at for
the grain market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not everybody wants to grow a 15
foot crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me that a shorter grain
variety would be more, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate for farmers who aren't yet
willing to spend tens of thousands on new
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the reason for that question
is about insects in the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you, how much emphasis are you
looking at for grain and all associated
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases and insects?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Sarah is asking about our emphasis in
terms of market class of hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, I would classify that we have
varieties that are best suited as a grain
[SPEAKER_05]: only dedicated grain crop that are easy to
harvest with conventional combines.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're today promoting, I'll say we're
promoting dual purpose crops, partly
[SPEAKER_05]: because we want to demonstrate that double
cup combine grain and fiber.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also because I think the market growth
potential right now is in the herd and
[SPEAKER_05]: fast areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we all know, Manitoba Harvest grows a
lot of grain in Canada and they can
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest that with those whatever 60 foot
wide combines out there, whatever they
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to defer your question till the
afternoon when we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: double cut because we are going to see
some strip trials out there that did not
[SPEAKER_05]: reach the height that we need for the
double cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I definitely think there is a need and
a market for dedicated grain only
[SPEAKER_05]: varieties once we get grain approved as an
animal feed, that's going to open up that
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want farmers to put those crops in
rotation with their other small cereal
[SPEAKER_05]: grains that they can harvest with their
combine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to move on.
[SPEAKER_12]: As Larry said, we've been certified
organic.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's, I think we started transition in
1992.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was, I was three.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really remember that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my whole life we've been organic.
[SPEAKER_12]: My viewpoint is not what can we get in a
jug to get, what can we get registered so
[SPEAKER_12]: we can handle the weeds?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's how do we manage the weeds
mechanically?
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my whole view on this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're farming about 1900 acres of organic
ground.
[SPEAKER_12]: We process seed.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and we do a lot of unusual things.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when hemp licensing started in 2018,
we jumped right on and tried to grow hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: and it was a horrible disaster because we
were focused on grain production and we
[SPEAKER_12]: were running with a relatively low
population.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we had some crusting issues and
we didn't have an adequate population to
[SPEAKER_12]: manage the weeds and we didn't harvest
anything two years in a row and we gave up
[SPEAKER_12]: the license because it just wasn't really
working.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Larry tried to pull me back into hemp
production a couple of times since then
[SPEAKER_12]: and I was not real interested until this
year when I ran into this machine,
[SPEAKER_12]: when I was in Germany visiting my wife's
family, it was a curiosity.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went to visit the company and they
told me that they have four machines
[SPEAKER_12]: running in Saskatchewan on hemp on an 8.6
by 8.6 spacing, dropping two seeds at each
[SPEAKER_12]: point.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've dramatically reduced their seeding
rate and they've increased yields and they
[SPEAKER_12]: have some side by side pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they realized they shouldn't have
told me so much and wouldn't tell me who
[SPEAKER_12]: was doing this.
[SPEAKER_12]: But that got me interested in trying this.
[SPEAKER_12]: We brought it in to grow red beets and we
were going to grow adzuki beans but we
[SPEAKER_12]: decided to try some hemp as well working
with a licensed grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were focused on seed production so we
went with a 15 inch row spacing with a 9
[SPEAKER_12]: inch in row spacing.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were dropping two to three seeds at
each seeding point so that the seeds were
[SPEAKER_12]: able to help each other out.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a uniform spacing but hill drop
seeding was a common practice 100 years
[SPEAKER_12]: ago before some of our modern technology
came along.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had by my calculations about 120,000
seeds per acre maybe 140,000 seeds per
[SPEAKER_12]: acre and where the machine did what it was
supposed to we have a perfectly clean
[SPEAKER_12]: field.
[SPEAKER_12]: I say where it did what it was supposed to
because there's a huge learning curve with
[SPEAKER_12]: this technology.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is an autonomous robot.
[SPEAKER_12]: It did all of the planting.
[SPEAKER_12]: It recorded the GPS location of every seed
to the nearest half centimeter.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why it has two GPS receivers on
top.
[SPEAKER_12]: We had to install our own base station.
[SPEAKER_12]: One of our landlords actually has worked
for the Navy and he said how are you
[SPEAKER_12]: getting it that accurate?
[SPEAKER_12]: I said I don't know.
[SPEAKER_12]: He was aware that that accuracy was
possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: He didn't realize that it was open to
civilians.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the principle of the machine is to drop
every seed know precisely where it is and
[SPEAKER_12]: then come back in later even pre-emergence
and cultivate between those seeds with a
[SPEAKER_12]: knife on an arm that is able to travel
back and forth between the seeding points.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can do that on as little as a hundred
millimeters so four inches of space
[SPEAKER_12]: between seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there is space to increase
seeding rate, decrease the space between
[SPEAKER_12]: seeds with this technology.
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent Larry a few pictures.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they went up of nearly clean under
canopy views.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also some videos of it working between
plants and because I don't know what your
[SPEAKER_12]: all interests might be I'm going to open
it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cost?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right around 100,000 U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is not currently an importer in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_12]: This came in through Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been putting a lot of pressure on
me to be an importer.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have time.
[SPEAKER_12]: So service is all coming out of Canada but
I think we're going to see that changing
[SPEAKER_12]: probably within the next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Economics return on investment?
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point I believe this is very much
a proof of concept thing so we're not as
[SPEAKER_12]: focused on that.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the return on investment has
to do with high value crops.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if this can be used on a farm that is
growing vegetables, that is growing also
[SPEAKER_12]: hemp, maybe some other fiber crops like
flax where your seeding period is
[SPEAKER_12]: stretched throughout the season and your
cultivation period is stretched throughout
[SPEAKER_12]: the season, the return is going to be a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_12]: It can theoretically handle 15 acres per
day.
[SPEAKER_12]: It does run 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_12]: So just spreading out the period when it
needs to be used is going to really
[SPEAKER_12]: increase the acres that you can cover in a
year and decrease the cost per acre.
[SPEAKER_12]: The operating cost per acre is practically
zero.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really just the wearing elements
because all of the energy comes from the
[SPEAKER_12]: solar panels.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: 24 hours but solar panels, so what kind of
storage of the energy that you have if
[SPEAKER_11]: you're going to let it plant after
midnight?
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a set of lithium ion batteries on
board.
[SPEAKER_12]: The solar panels produce up to 1600 watts
of power and the maximum power requirement
[SPEAKER_12]: of the machine is 1100.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it will charge through the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a second set of batteries that
can be put on if needed.
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the users in Europe that I talked
to are actually mounting like a little 600
[SPEAKER_12]: watt inverter type generator on it and
going out turning it on at 10 o'clock at
[SPEAKER_12]: night to charge the battery while it
continues working and shut it off when the
[SPEAKER_12]: sun comes up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's self-propelled.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is self-propelled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tractor is not needed.
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it is fully autonomous.
[SPEAKER_12]: Once you map the points in the field and
any obstacles, it develops a plan of where
[SPEAKER_12]: it's going to drive and then executes the
plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the deal with stones in the soil?
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't particularly like stones.
[SPEAKER_12]: Soil preparation is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stony here.
[SPEAKER_12]: It is stony here.
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say that we are stonier down 10
miles south here in Penian.
[SPEAKER_12]: The glaciers had a lot of fun on our farm.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been picking stones since I was big
enough to pick them up and I think my
[SPEAKER_12]: grandkids probably will be... You think
they grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the soil is ending up in the
lake.
[SPEAKER_12]: So soil preparation is a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is very much focused at a
horticultural model where you are paying
[SPEAKER_12]: much more attention to the soil than in
broad acre production.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a great point, Jack,
that mechanical cultivation is very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very challenging on stony soil and we have
a lot of those in New York.
[SPEAKER_04]: One-of-a-kind competition, anything else
like this?
[SPEAKER_12]: There are some other companies in Europe.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's I think a lot more of a grant
funding program in the EU for autonomy
[SPEAKER_12]: because labor costs are higher.
[SPEAKER_12]: There's another company from Denmark
called Roboti.
[SPEAKER_12]: Kongskild was working in this for a while
but I believe when they were bought by
[SPEAKER_12]: Case New Holland that kind of went in a
different direction.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a company called NIO in France
that is working on this and there is a
[SPEAKER_12]: raven in Canada is working on a much
larger scale version of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mentioned the steep learning curve.
[SPEAKER_09]: What sort of obstacles did you have to go
through?
[SPEAKER_12]: We prepared the ground like we would for
our normal cultivation equipment and
[SPEAKER_12]: planting equipment and it wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't like the amount of residue that
was on top.
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't like how loose the soil was.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first crop that we planted with it I
had I think 300 text messages that
[SPEAKER_12]: something went wrong in the course of a
day and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it cover the seed?
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's currently set up mostly in weeding
configuration.
[SPEAKER_12]: This row unit is set up for planting.
[SPEAKER_12]: There is one item missing because I forgot
to bring it up from the barn which is a
[SPEAKER_12]: closing shoe that goes on the back behind
the primary press wheel before the
[SPEAKER_12]: secondary press wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it moves in this direction?
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about in row cultivation?
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a servo motor and it's on now so
it's not being cooperative.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't like to move but that servo
motor moves an arm in and out.
[SPEAKER_12]: That arm carries a knife and is able to
cultivate between seeding points that it
[SPEAKER_12]: has mapped during the seeding process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully the video is up on our website.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it going around the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be one of the most popular ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thanks very much Peter.
[SPEAKER_19]: We really appreciate Cornell and Dr. Smart
working with us and giving us the
[SPEAKER_19]: opportunity to build this machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the first mobile cordicator that's
been built and functional in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: We built the smaller one that was in
Russia in 2018.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's still running but it's a hand-fed
single stock machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been making machinery since 2016,
2017.
[SPEAKER_19]: Believe it or not we started on the
cordication back then when it was not a
[SPEAKER_19]: thing and nobody was interested in it.
[SPEAKER_19]: At the time we thought we would make the
cordicators which the cordicator is just
[SPEAKER_19]: the second piece.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of been pieces right here.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the cordicator.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a roller breaker style machine.
[SPEAKER_19]: Believe it or not based on the 1905
Slickton model that got him banned in the
[SPEAKER_19]: first place.
[SPEAKER_19]: We figured if it worked then it would work
now and being a good German he put a bunch
[SPEAKER_19]: of stuff in his bed and it didn't work and
we spent a couple of years figuring that
[SPEAKER_19]: out but we've got a technique that if
you've got a crop that is grown with
[SPEAKER_19]: intent for fiber and grown on you know
three eighths of an inch maybe half inch
[SPEAKER_19]: nine meter stalks does a very good job of
separating if the crops been rented and
[SPEAKER_19]: properly put up which we're learning more
about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_19]: We also farm hemp in Colorado you know in
2014, 2015 when CBD started a bunch of
[SPEAKER_19]: people got into it and a bunch of people
got burned so it's a little difficult for
[SPEAKER_19]: us to get contract labor or contract
farming done in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we actually just drink ground and farm
it ourselves and then we know what we're
[SPEAKER_19]: going to get.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Smart mentioned global fiber.
[SPEAKER_19]: I do most of the R&D for global fiber and
formation but we've come out with a
[SPEAKER_19]: structural load bearing hemp block that is
not hemp created it's actual structural in
[SPEAKER_19]: a cinder block configuration construction
masonry unit.
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll hold 2,500 pounds per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_19]: Normal cinder blocks are 1,500 and we've
got three or four more products that as we
[SPEAKER_19]: keep working on them that you'll get to
see them and it all starts with this it
[SPEAKER_19]: was as an evolution in trying to figure
out where can we take the 25,000 uses for
[SPEAKER_19]: it where can we make a dollar at it
because we have to pay for all this stuff
[SPEAKER_19]: and we've come up with some pretty
innovative value-add agricultural products
[SPEAKER_19]: that we can do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_19]: He mentioned de-hulling that's a great
thing wish more people would eat it we'd
[SPEAKER_19]: have a lot more de-hullers around.
[SPEAKER_19]: This cinder block deal that we came up
with changes to me changes the paradigm to
[SPEAKER_19]: add for agriculture because this is not
just hundreds of acres it's tens of
[SPEAKER_19]: thousands of acres to supply this block.
[SPEAKER_19]: There are 522 billion cinder blocks made
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_19]: every single year if we took a tenth of a
percent of that market we would need
[SPEAKER_19]: 690,000 acres of hemp grown which that's a
difference I mean that that makes a
[SPEAKER_19]: difference in our area water is a very big
thing conservation of water we can grow a
[SPEAKER_19]: hemp crop on seven to eight inches of
water where a potato is between 26 and 28
[SPEAKER_19]: inches of water alfalfa is 28 to 32 this
year is really hot they want even more so
[SPEAKER_19]: it's a great technique for conserving
water and all the other soil health
[SPEAKER_19]: benefits that hemp does for it,
compaction, organic matter etc.
[SPEAKER_19]: but that's why we keep pushing for ag to
adopt more hemp acres it's not easy if you
[SPEAKER_19]: want to be in hemp it's dirty dusty nasty
frustrating work sometimes but it's the
[SPEAKER_19]: right thing to do so we think that's good
work and that's why we keep investing our
[SPEAKER_19]: money in it so this machine starts with a
bale in feed you would think that you can
[SPEAKER_19]: just unwind hemp on a hay bale machine but
you can't turns out we've tried a bunch of
[SPEAKER_19]: them it doesn't work very well because a
hemp crop and any other crop really
[SPEAKER_19]: doesn't always grow perfectly consistent
we don't have hundreds of years of
[SPEAKER_19]: breeding and when you drive down the field
and you see a corn field all the years are
[SPEAKER_19]: pretty much at the same height they're all
almost all the same stature hemp doesn't
[SPEAKER_19]: grow like that we have hemp fields that
are four feet tall and then you go 20 feet
[SPEAKER_19]: and it's 10 feet tall 12 feet tall so we
had to innovate something that could
[SPEAKER_19]: handle that and meter the flow of the
material downstream into the machine so we
[SPEAKER_19]: came up with this machine and what it is
is it's unrolling the bale kind of the
[SPEAKER_19]: opposite direction of as it was wound up
and then we're shearing off a certain
[SPEAKER_19]: thickness right now it's set for an inch
and a quarter mat we can go up to two or
[SPEAKER_19]: three inches we can go down a little bit
but we found inch and a quarter is roughly
[SPEAKER_19]: where it needs to be so that the machine
can more efficiently work it's a little
[SPEAKER_19]: counter the thinner the mat you feed to
this machine the faster you can run
[SPEAKER_19]: because the the corducator can do more
work on a thinner mat they can a thicker
[SPEAKER_19]: you'd think that would be opposite but
it's not this machine also tips up on the
[SPEAKER_19]: incline if you need more pressure against
the shearing device but that's that piece
[SPEAKER_19]: of machine in our facility based ones we
put dust hoods over the top to collect the
[SPEAKER_19]: dust because our bales sit outside we live
in the desert sand gets blown into them
[SPEAKER_19]: and it just creates dust so we have dust
collection and at altitude dust
[SPEAKER_19]: collections are real pain we live at 8,000
feet so it's kind of a nuisance 7,700 feet
[SPEAKER_19]: the main machine up up there open those
doors so they can see the gearing on it it
[SPEAKER_19]: looks simple but that that second section
right here that he's opening the doors on
[SPEAKER_19]: that's 12,000 pounds of steel that's about
what it takes to break this crop apart the
[SPEAKER_19]: more humid it is the more work it takes so
we engineer that those gears so we can let
[SPEAKER_19]: those springs compress the springs are
putting pressure on the stock and we're
[SPEAKER_19]: working it gradually as we go you can't
just start decorticating you have to break
[SPEAKER_19]: it up get it softer and then those rollers
get faster as it goes through the machine
[SPEAKER_19]: so not only do we kind of break it apart
but we're brushing the material off of the
[SPEAKER_19]: herd off of the fiber and that's what
makes that work you can push a button the
[SPEAKER_19]: top half of that machine opens up because
hemp made really good rope right you hear
[SPEAKER_19]: that about the sailing ships and all that
it still makes really good rope and if
[SPEAKER_19]: there's a round spot that hemp can wrap on
it we'll find it when we start this thing
[SPEAKER_19]: up we're sitting at about a three degree
angle away from us and it's making the
[SPEAKER_19]: fiber run towards the right hand side of
the machine so that's a it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_19]: pain but I bought a jack a minute ago and
lifted it up we'll see what it does so
[SPEAKER_19]: that's what the decorticator looks like
and then we always had her gets entangled
[SPEAKER_19]: in the fiber this machine the normal
roller breaker can only just take straight
[SPEAKER_19]: stocks but the way we feed it and the way
we've innovated this machine we can take
[SPEAKER_19]: round bailed unoriented stocks and it
actually turns the bay of the stocks as
[SPEAKER_19]: they go through the machine to brush the
herd off but there's always a little bit
[SPEAKER_19]: of entanglement between the herd and the
fiber so the next piece we call it a
[SPEAKER_19]: shaker table pretty creative name but
that's all we got it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_19]: shaking up and down but it's actually the
ellipse it throws the material up in the
[SPEAKER_19]: air material starts to come down that it
impacts the material again knocks a little
[SPEAKER_19]: bit more of the herd out it's still not
perfect so that next piece of machinery is
[SPEAKER_19]: a herd cleaner it's an old piece of
machinery where the upside is we recycle
[SPEAKER_19]: them we try to be environmentally friendly
we change a little bit of the guts on the
[SPEAKER_19]: inside of it that separates what fiber is
left on the herd as best it can away from
[SPEAKER_19]: the herd sends the herd down to the last
piece of machinery the fiber that comes
[SPEAKER_19]: out of here goes out to the we call it
short fiber side it's in it is it's just
[SPEAKER_19]: short fiber but the goal of the overall
machine because we want to make industrial
[SPEAKER_19]: textiles meaning not clothes kind of stuff
but clothing too we want as long a fiber
[SPEAKER_19]: as we can possibly get when you clean and
refine hemp fiber down to where you can
[SPEAKER_19]: get it to be spun you have to start with a
really long fiber the fibers in these bags
[SPEAKER_19]: are bundles they're not individual fibers
by far an individual hip fiber is about 75
[SPEAKER_19]: 80 millimeters long and and I forget the
microns it's it's you know human hair
[SPEAKER_19]: thickness it's pretty tiny but to get to
that you have to start with really long
[SPEAKER_19]: fibers we can always cut something down
natural fiber right we can't make it any
[SPEAKER_19]: longer so this technique is geared towards
long-line fiber ultimately so that we can
[SPEAKER_19]: make very strong cordage I came out of
plastic so I call them tape still but they
[SPEAKER_19]: call them yarn so you want to know the
yarn count of your fiber right so when we
[SPEAKER_19]: break this down we've got if this was a
full system there'd be another
[SPEAKER_19]: semi-trailer sitting here that we clean
and refine the fiber and we're learning
[SPEAKER_19]: more and more about that all the time
we've developed some techniques where we
[SPEAKER_19]: think well we know we can open fiber up to
the point where it can be spun without
[SPEAKER_19]: parts chain gilds or combs which is really
neat nobody's ever done that in the world
[SPEAKER_19]: so and that's that's another one of our R
&D projects we're not done with it we
[SPEAKER_19]: self-fund all this stuff so it takes us
way longer than it should to innovate some
[SPEAKER_19]: things sometimes but so we call this first
milled fiber coming out of the machine on
[SPEAKER_19]: the bottom is the first milled herd then
we clean the short fiber off the herd when
[SPEAKER_19]: the herd comes out of this large grade
machine here it goes into the one that's
[SPEAKER_19]: on the nose of the trailer that's going to
separate it into small medium and large
[SPEAKER_19]: parts small is like floor dry kitty litter
things like that the medium size the way
[SPEAKER_19]: it's set right now is builder grade herd
or animal bedding it's a half an inch to
[SPEAKER_19]: an inch oversized product the way we've
got set right now is in inches to inch and
[SPEAKER_19]: a half just the way we're transporting it
we because it's on a trailer and we didn't
[SPEAKER_19]: have a lot of room we usually use
conveyors to move the herd but we had to
[SPEAKER_19]: innovate something different so we're
moving it with air we don't move the fiber
[SPEAKER_19]: with air especially when it's long because
air turns into vortex in a tube when
[SPEAKER_19]: you're conveying things long fiber turns
into a giant rope and then it becomes very
[SPEAKER_19]: hard to machine after that so we still use
conveyors until we've broken it down to
[SPEAKER_19]: you know six eight inch pieces just
depends on what you're running we do see
[SPEAKER_19]: wide varieties in genetics harvesting
techniques ready techniques all impact to
[SPEAKER_19]: cortication so you can set yourself up for
success by controlling your farming
[SPEAKER_19]: practice your harvest practice when it
comes to that structural load bearing
[SPEAKER_19]: broth we're trying to go from seed all the
way to the finished product to control the
[SPEAKER_19]: spec because that product will be stamped
by an engineer that's doing the building
[SPEAKER_19]: this block the engineers at university
nebraska with that load rating say we can
[SPEAKER_19]: go four stories high it's a true
structural deal you still need hip creep
[SPEAKER_19]: we still hip creep is an insulated product
is not structural hip creep is 21 pounds
[SPEAKER_19]: per cubic foot load bearing styrofoam
there's nothing there so you still need
[SPEAKER_19]: that for insulation so the whole plant you
can still use for building material it's
[SPEAKER_19]: just fascinating to me what all we could
do with this product what else you want to
[SPEAKER_19]: know about it but that's kind of the
machine that really excited to have this
[SPEAKER_19]: thing running and here it's it's a pretty
unique deal we ran it at our shop and
[SPEAKER_19]: we're really happy with it trucked it 1900
miles over here one thing I do know is the
[SPEAKER_19]: u.s.
[SPEAKER_19]: does not build very good roads in the
middle part of the country so we spent
[SPEAKER_19]: three days tightening things that I never
thought we would tighten so but we did so
[SPEAKER_19]: if something's banging around that's why
it is ohio and indiana have really crappy
[SPEAKER_19]: roads so new york roads I got I told dr.
smart one thing I thought I would never do
[SPEAKER_19]: is drive my semi east of the Mississippi
and I was really happy with the roads here
[SPEAKER_19]: and he said yeah because we tax everybody
but it does work you have great roads here
[SPEAKER_19]: so I was happy to see that so but I'm sure
we got questions in a group of this side
[SPEAKER_19]: just feel free to answer ask them all so
I'll do my best runs standard cinder block
[SPEAKER_19]: size 8 by 8 by 16 hollow we've run 6 by 6
by 1 papers we've run 3 by 3 by 8 bricks
[SPEAKER_19]: it is formulated and engineered to run on
existing precast manufacturing lines
[SPEAKER_19]: that's how it's formulated I can't tell
you that we've got three years of time and
[SPEAKER_19]: money into that and we figured out the
chemistry of it and it uses no portland
[SPEAKER_19]: cement no sand no aggregate aggregate
think of the hemp is kind of replacing the
[SPEAKER_19]: rock you know we think it can be done like
that she asked if it could be molded to 3d
[SPEAKER_19]: printed it flows so yeah if you can pump
it it can be moved it's amazing it's it's
[SPEAKER_19]: fairly viscous if you will when it comes
out of the volumetric mixers but if you
[SPEAKER_19]: vibrate it it flows like it's wet like
water I don't I still haven't figured that
[SPEAKER_19]: out either of the structural engineer guys
but it flows just like a normal precast
[SPEAKER_19]: zero slump cement yeah yeah yeah well we
sell the herd in the wet chemistry part of
[SPEAKER_19]: it the goal is to license she asked me if
it's available the goal is to license
[SPEAKER_19]: block manufacturers to work with
architects and builders in regions and
[SPEAKER_19]: then set up facilities like this to supply
those regions if it's Omaha Nebraska or
[SPEAKER_19]: out here in Cornell I'm sure there's a
precast company and you've got farmers
[SPEAKER_19]: that want to grow hemp you set up a
facility you start feeding herd into that
[SPEAKER_19]: manufacturing plant yep anymore are you
are you supplying some of the short fiber
[SPEAKER_19]: yes if we send material to have a texture
the short fiber that comes off the back is
[SPEAKER_19]: is what the temperature buys they want
short small fibers for their cellulose bad
[SPEAKER_19]: insulation believe it or not the question
was fire preventative measures you don't
[SPEAKER_19]: cut on this machine you don't weld or
grind on it believe it or not hemp dust is
[SPEAKER_19]: not explosive we've sent it off and had it
tested we did that here too and with the
[SPEAKER_19]: order for Cornell but it will smolder for
about an hour or so if it's a spark and
[SPEAKER_19]: then we've never had a fire knock on wood
in the six years we've been running the
[SPEAKER_19]: corticators in our facility we're careful
to clean heaters we clean light fixtures
[SPEAKER_19]: we have fire extinguishers laying around
but knock on wood we've never had a catch
[SPEAKER_19]: on fire we did have a little pile sitting
out in the parking lot after a rainstorm
[SPEAKER_19]: one day and it got hot after that and I
don't know if somebody was cutting out
[SPEAKER_19]: there but it caught on fire but we've been
very fortunate not to have it it does burn
[SPEAKER_19]: and when it does it burns really neat but
it takes a long time and energy to get it
[SPEAKER_19]: going so that that's a great question
people you know it will burn when it burns
[SPEAKER_05]: it's hot let me follow up that question
part of the reason why this machinery is
[SPEAKER_05]: mounted on a trailer is because the
Cornell facilities and environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: health and safety folks reviewed this
entire project came up with specs for the
[SPEAKER_05]: building that we would need to contain it
to achieve Cornell standards and one of
[SPEAKER_05]: our engineers Scott the Hollander is here
who can attest to all this and Amy Fox our
[SPEAKER_05]: EH &S person is here as well that would
have been a more than two million dollar
[SPEAKER_05]: facility to construct new with all of the
proper fire and explosion hazard equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: so Corbett Corbett is works in a different
regulatory environment than we do I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just say that but that is we are only
allowed to operate this machine outdoors
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why it's on the trailer so we are
building a barn that will protect it from
[SPEAKER_05]: the elements and then we will have a
little trolley that will build it that
[SPEAKER_05]: will pull it out of the building for
operation of course the other reason to
[SPEAKER_05]: have it on a trailer is to be able to move
it around the state and we want to bring
[SPEAKER_05]: it to Henry Gage and Ulster County we want
to bring it to there's Henry we want we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to bring it to Henry's farm and show
how it works we want to bring it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: North Country want to bring it to Western
New York and we will do that let me just
[SPEAKER_05]: say that hopefully within the month I will
be posting an advertisement for a research
[SPEAKER_05]: support specialist to manage this machine
to operate it and hopefully with a CDL
[SPEAKER_05]: truck driver's license so that person can
drive it around the state so if you know
[SPEAKER_05]: of someone an engineer with farming
experience as well to operate this machine
[SPEAKER_10]: have them look out for that job
[SPEAKER_19]: there you go he was asking what is the
weight of this bale and the throughput on
[SPEAKER_19]: the machine we bale are in five foot round
bales and they're 1,100, 1,200,
[SPEAKER_19]: 1,300 pounds roughly if you make them too
loose they don't like to run very well if
[SPEAKER_19]: you make them 2,000 pounds if there's any
flour left on them they stick together and
[SPEAKER_19]: they're really hard to unwind so
throughput wise configured like this if
[SPEAKER_19]: you're just running herd problem here is
how do you take away the fiber fast enough
[SPEAKER_19]: it'll run you know at least a ton an hour
we've got some automatic machines to pull
[SPEAKER_19]: the fiber away we get a ton and a half an
hour on this machine this would be
[SPEAKER_19]: slightly slower just because it doesn't
have some of the extra automation parts on
[SPEAKER_19]: it you know we ran he's asking me how much
dust we ran one of one of the cordels
[SPEAKER_19]: bales last night we live in a desert so
this bale's got sand in it the bale we ran
[SPEAKER_19]: last night didn't have a whole lot of dust
a bunch of rocks in it so it varies by how
[SPEAKER_19]: it was harvested where you store we store
all this stuff outside because we live in
[SPEAKER_19]: a desert so it never really gets wet we
get six inches rain here our facility is
[SPEAKER_19]: in a large potato storage warehouse that
we bought if our bales get wet we set them
[SPEAKER_19]: up on top of the culverts and turn on the
fan for 10-12 hours and they're down to 4%
[SPEAKER_19]: moisture which I don't even know if you
get that low here we try to bail it at
[SPEAKER_19]: 15-18 just like you do hay here north of
18% moisture I would not bail it because
[SPEAKER_19]: this stuff will get hot question back here
sir thought I saw another one nope the
[SPEAKER_17]: flies yes sir can you talk a little bit
about the characteristics of the varieties
[SPEAKER_17]: that run best through here in terms of
decortication you talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_17]: about long fibers one of the things I'm
noticing is there's kind of two different
[SPEAKER_17]: camps in the fiber varieties you got some
that have no branching and some that have
[SPEAKER_17]: lots of branching have you noticed like
like what are some of the best
[SPEAKER_17]: characteristics you're looking for in
fiber to run through this the seed
[SPEAKER_19]: salesman wants to know what varieties we
do right so characteristics these are
[SPEAKER_19]: observations that we made over the years
running fiber we've probably touched more
[SPEAKER_19]: of it than than anybody we run Chinese
stuff Colorado stuff feral crops growth
[SPEAKER_19]: nodes are a problem the herd likes to
stick where there's a growth node where
[SPEAKER_19]: there's branching so we drill everything
on six at centers we put in about 450 to
[SPEAKER_19]: 550 thousand seeds per acre that gives us
between a quarter inch diameter stock and
[SPEAKER_19]: three-eighths of an inch which gives us
thick enough heard that the builders are
[SPEAKER_19]: happy but not enough growth nodes that we
have lots of issues with the fiber so that
[SPEAKER_19]: tight spacing can help reduce the
branching because it forces the bunch to
[SPEAKER_19]: go up trying to get to the Sun right
they're competing with themselves genetics
[SPEAKER_19]: wise we've run future all this pictures
run really good carbon yola runs good I'm
[SPEAKER_19]: not a hundred percent sure what this is
our bales are 60 inches this one's 68 so
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure where this one came from but
I think it's a French variety that was
[SPEAKER_19]: grown in Nebraska two years ago by one of
our other partners he's got a couple
[SPEAKER_19]: sections of ground in the lights Nebraska
and I think that's one of his fails but
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not exactly sure what it is what other
genetics we've run we've run Yuma we've
[SPEAKER_19]: run the Chinese Yuma there was a Yuma
crossbow that was bred in Eastern Colorado
[SPEAKER_19]: and the guy also made one called a one and
a two and man I wish he would have not
[SPEAKER_19]: stopped a one and a two a one was a little
hot a two both of those made the best
[SPEAKER_19]: fiber heard and grain that we've run and
when CBD crashed in 2019 he quit and we've
[SPEAKER_19]: got about a pound of that seed left we've
taken that fiber to North Carolina to
[SPEAKER_19]: their textile school and they have spun it
and didn't even realize it was a dual
[SPEAKER_19]: purpose grain crop right common knowledge
is oh it has to be grown like fiber to be
[SPEAKER_19]: used in textiles well that's all we had we
sent it to him he says yeah this stuff's
[SPEAKER_19]: really great and then we brought some
another little batch with it he said well
[SPEAKER_19]: this wasn't ready because it's the colors
different we live in the desert we don't
[SPEAKER_19]: be great and he had no idea he was running
that stuff the whole time so I think
[SPEAKER_19]: propagation technique and genetics are
important processing technique is almost
[SPEAKER_19]: more important in my mind of separating
the fiber and it depends on what you want
[SPEAKER_19]: to do with the stuff if you're making
cellulose insulation for for him but
[SPEAKER_19]: you're you you could probably get away
with something different and a different
[SPEAKER_19]: technique than what we have here we're
trying to do long fibers I came out of the
[SPEAKER_19]: plastic century strange made nonwoven and
Rochelle net products and converted it
[SPEAKER_19]: into fresh produce packaging potato bags
any bag any bag you buy in the grocery
[SPEAKER_19]: store that's got nonwoven mesh on it we
innovated that and and the mesh that it's
[SPEAKER_19]: made on so we're trying to do things like
that they consume miles of material not
[SPEAKER_19]: just a little different position in the
marketplace because we see those as better
[SPEAKER_19]: value-added products that will let us take
care of the farmers better you know if you
[SPEAKER_19]: look at the diesel price and gas price in
the last few days it jumped up well when
[SPEAKER_19]: that happens fertilizer will go up we paid
four hundred and thirty bucks a ton for
[SPEAKER_19]: fertilizer this year more last year well
what's that what's that mean is we're
[SPEAKER_19]: paying three hundred we'll probably have
to jump to four hundred dollars a ton to
[SPEAKER_19]: pay the farmers next year to grow it if we
contract it or when we do it ourselves we
[SPEAKER_19]: still have to pay for land and fertility
and we have to pay for water so that that
[SPEAKER_19]: cost has to roll down to the farm and
without farmers participating in this and
[SPEAKER_19]: making a dollar at it it's really hard to
keep things going so that's really
[SPEAKER_05]: important to take care of our farm so I'm
gonna cut off questions for now we have
[SPEAKER_05]: plenty of time over lunch to continue
asking questions of Corbett we want to get
[SPEAKER_05]: the machine started this
[SPEAKER_16]: has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell edu you
