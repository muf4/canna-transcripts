[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Liz and I think Susan introduced
my project pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been looking at temperature
impacts on irrigated maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start out by giving you a little
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize is the top cereal crop produced on a
weight basis in the world and it's of
[SPEAKER_00]: critical importance to food security and
also to energy budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, there's a lot of interest
in if maize cropping systems are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: remain as productive as they are today
with a changing climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of local variability and
uncertainty in climate projections but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's consensus that air temperatures
are going to increase in the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past decade, there's been a number
of studies that have developed econometric
[SPEAKER_00]: models that are trying to look at these
air temperature impacts on yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we can make projections about
maize cropping system yields based on air
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these studies have come up with
some pretty startling results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first one by Schlenker and Roberts
showed that based on a nonlinear
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with increasing air
temperature and maize yields, we could see
[SPEAKER_00]: declines in maize yields up to 82% in the
next century because of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobel et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2009 showed that maize yields have
already dropped by 3.8% since 2009 after
[SPEAKER_00]: they adjusted for a yield trend in their
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arielle Ortiz-Borbera in a recent work
that was challenging the validity of using
[SPEAKER_00]: a single climate metric to make these
projections warned that the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus is that climate change impacts
will largely be driven by exposure to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see some evidence that suggests
that this is not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: As maize is grown in Argentina,
Ecuador, Ontario, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperature regimes where maize
is being grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What constitutes a heat stress threshold
in one place doesn't necessarily mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a heat stress threshold in another place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, we've seen that what
constitutes a stressful temperature can
[SPEAKER_00]: change in one location from season to
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, the maize's response to heat
represents an acclimation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's modified by prior temperature regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, some other studies have come
out that have shown that how we manage our
[SPEAKER_00]: maize cropping systems interacts with the
temperature response as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been evidence presented that
management can help to buffer some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these negative impacts from air
temperature alone so that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to adapt our systems to the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably most importantly, down here,
a recent work by Susan Ria and Steven Shaw
[SPEAKER_00]: over at SUNY ESF showed that if you're
looking at irrigated maize cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, this apparent response to
temperature just about disappears,
[SPEAKER_00]: which suggests that previous models might
have been complaining heat and water
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, which are, of course, often
related in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we were interested in doing is seeing
if this econometric approach can be used
[SPEAKER_00]: to get at the mechanism of heat stress in
these cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our approach to doing this was to break
the maize growing season down into growth
[SPEAKER_00]: development periods, which is not at all
unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea here is that heat stress
occurring at different points in maize
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and development is going to have
very different mechanisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to that heat stress response
that we're seeing in yields, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: different adaptation mechanisms would be
needed to be developed, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat stress mechanism was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at more than just
temperature with a little bit of nuance,
[SPEAKER_00]: because depending on how you break it
down, multiple climate variables can come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play in helping you to determine
exactly what that heat stress mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that we did, and I'm going
to go a little bit more into detail about
[SPEAKER_00]: this later, is we modeled the duration of
our growth development phases using
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal time instead of using set
intervals for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the reason here is we're looking
at temperature stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at when the temperature
stress is happening in growth development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If those high temperatures are changing
the duration of the growth development
[SPEAKER_00]: periods, we'd want to be able to capture
that as an artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, increased rates of physiological
development have been suggested as a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress mechanism in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our objectives, once again, were to see if
we could get at a maize yield response to
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature if we were adjusting for
these other confounding factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as management, or more importantly,
moisture stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see if we could do a
mechanistic analysis of this heat stress
[SPEAKER_00]: by looking at the timing of heat stress
during crop development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to see if we could quantify the
potential adaptation for management and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to do this using an
econometric model because we had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing bank of yield data to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: National Corn Growers Association is one
of the two largest maize advocacy
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winners of the National Corn Yield Contest
have consistently set world records for
[SPEAKER_00]: maize yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got historical yield data from the
National Corn Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all contest entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We secured a data set where management has
been optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of these growers is to get to
that yield potential, the place where the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing that's holding their yields
back are climate and the potential of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only looked at irrigated classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we wanted to control for the
soil moisture stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the states of Kansas,
Missouri, and Nebraska for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a really high density of irrigated
yields in these states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, especially with Kansas and Missouri,
we're getting some of the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that we're gonna get in the
corn belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked from the years 2005 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, for a few reasons,
we had significant interannual variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in yields, also in climate conditions,
including 2012, which was a very hot year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any significant yield trend
that needed to be adjusted for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our climate data, we used hourly
climate data from the Missouri Mesonet and
[SPEAKER_00]: the High Plains Regional Climate Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had access to almost 70 weather
stations in our study area.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this data had been quality controlled
and gap filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We matched that climate data to our yield
values based on proximity and also similar
[SPEAKER_00]: GDD zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we're trying to make sure
we're getting as close to accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature conditions as we could here.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, like I had mentioned before,
one thing that I forgot to mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty important with the yield
contest data, just gonna go back,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have access to the planting date and
the cultivar, as well as a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other management parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The management parameters are important
because one of our research questions
[SPEAKER_00]: were, can we quantify the adaptation
potential to any temperature impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: through management?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that's important here is
if we have the planting date and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, we can take that planting date
to start our growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use cultivar specified GDD to
maturity and to soaking to model with
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fine resolution what our growth
development periods were using thermal
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to our climate variables,
we calculated temperature stress in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that we found in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had hourly data, so we were able to
calculate, can you live degree hours over
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperature thresholds?
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at quite a few of them,
but I'm gonna talk here about 30 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: and 34 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amount of time that the crop
spent in a temperature stress condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, with those variables,
a zero stress situation where we had no
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures above that threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use KDD.
[SPEAKER_00]: KDD stands for killing degree days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often called extreme degree days too
in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same thing as a normal growing
degree day calculation, except for you're
[SPEAKER_00]: setting your base temperature at what you
would consider your temperature stress
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold and there's no upper limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cumulative degree days where daily
Tmax was over 29 degrees C because that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: once again, the value that's most often
being used in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at average night
temperature, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: self-explanatory, and cumulative solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For each yield value, we calculated this
over the growing season and also during
[SPEAKER_00]: growth development periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, all of those durations were
modeled using thermal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we wanted to be able to quantify,
I guess, the magnitude of yield response
[SPEAKER_00]: from climate impacts relative to other
variables that we had access to in this
[SPEAKER_00]: data set, we used a mixed effects model
for fixed effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used planting rate, planting date,
cultivar GDD, maturity, and previous crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were in the model because they were
the most significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had random effects for cultivar,
so that would be genetic variation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not due to the maturity class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Location, once again, pretty
self-explanatory, if there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: location-based trends in our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm ID nested in location, that lets us
look at the difference between farm A and
[SPEAKER_00]: farm B that are in close proximity to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be management level differences
that we can't get out with our data,
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at year of planting because
we're specifically interested in seeing if
[SPEAKER_00]: we can explain any of the inter-annual
yield variables in the variability that we
[SPEAKER_00]: know is in our data using climate
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we built this base model,
our climate variables were tested as fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we could get the relative
magnitude of yield response out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, most of the studies that we're
following up on looked at the accumulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of heat stress over the entire growing
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did that with our irrigated
yields, we saw that none of our daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature stress indices were
significantly related to yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was a little bit of a surprising
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation, as you'd expect in irrigated
maize under optimum management,
[SPEAKER_00]: was significantly related to yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average night temperature was also
significantly related to yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at these yield responses on
a standardized scale, so change in
[SPEAKER_00]: standard deviations of predictor variable
per change in standard deviations in
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, they're about equal in magnitude
and inverse of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that night temperature has an
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get at the mechanism for yield
decline due to high night temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back before, we did model the
duration of our growing season using
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to get at a potential heat
stress mechanism, which is accelerated
[SPEAKER_00]: rates of phenological development,
by doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two conflicting schools of thought
about why night temperatures would impact
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that increased night temperatures
leads to night respiration, and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: is that increased night temperatures
increase development rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would just, like I spoke about,
end up with less intercepted radiation per
[SPEAKER_00]: unit thermal time over the life of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we modeled our growth periods
using thermal time and we calculated our
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation variable by that model,
we've already captured that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already captured the accelerated
phenological development with radiation as
[SPEAKER_00]: the variable that would define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking for here is an impact
of night temperature independent of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation, and we didn't see one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as we can tell with our data set
and our method of analysis, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing an impact of night respiration,
but our data seems to support the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the impact of night temperatures is
increased rates of development,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, radiation was the most yield
limiting climate variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just kind of illustrates that point
with this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graph on the left shows our yields in
blue by year, and then our distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation is shown in pink also by year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they track each other
somewhat nicely there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The graph on the right is the same thing,
yields in blue, but the distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: our high temperatures are illustrated in
pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, like in 2009, low temperatures,
high yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012, where we actually had our highest
yields in the yield contest data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually also the hottest year in our
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that radiation has the most
explanatory power of any of our climate
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also know that it's correlated with
high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question is, could the positive
yield response from radiation be masking
[SPEAKER_00]: any impact of high temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we moved into our growth development
phase analysis, we decided to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation and high temperature at the same
time in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also picked TT34.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were modeling our thermal time,
we had a cutoff on our GDD of 34 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, this would be getting at
temperatures that we haven't already
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for by increasing the rates of
development there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do account for radiation in the
model, daytime temperature does become
[SPEAKER_00]: significant, but it does so in kind of an
odd way.
[SPEAKER_00]: During early growth right here,
you see that TT34 and early growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: grain fill, high temperatures,
have a slight negative association with
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: These came into the model as being
significant with a crossed effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, we saw that early growth
radiation modifies yield response to high
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that are happening during
grain fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early growth exposure to stressful
temperatures gives us a positive response
[SPEAKER_00]: to those same stressful temperatures if
they happen again during grain fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't, your crop wasn't exposed to
any high temperatures in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a big heat wave comes around during
grain fill, you'll see a yield decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you've had consistently high
temperatures, you actually get the
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be beneficial for yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A modification there may be of what's
constituting a stressful temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that you see is that
radiation remains significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a positive estimate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These regression estimates, that's just
the change in standard deviations of yield
[SPEAKER_00]: that would happen with one of those
predictor variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also see that high TT34 during grain
fill negatively modifies the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: yield response you get from increasing
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we have significant climate
effects, these climate effects are only
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining a very, very small amount of
the total yield variance that we had in
[SPEAKER_00]: our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here is just yield variance
explained by model effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our random effects are in purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fixed effects are in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation and TT34, so all of our
significant climate effects, land about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only explain just under 6% of the
total variance in the data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: To contrast that, genetics, which you can
find in this pool right here, other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and also in cultivar GDD to
maturity, so maturity class and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's left over that explains
yields besides maturity class,
[SPEAKER_00]: explained more yield variance than our
climate variables did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planting rate and planting date explained
more yield variance than our climate
[SPEAKER_00]: variables did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting these climate variables into the
model only explained about 15% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: interannual yield anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have a whole lot of interannual
variance in our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to point out right here is the
farm level variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between farm A and farm B
that are neighbors to each other is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty significant pool of our variance
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The residual error, this is just the
traditional error term that you'd see in
[SPEAKER_00]: any linear model, was just over 30% of the
total variance in the data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also noisy data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice when I was looking at the
regression coefficients before,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't point out that there was a
significant temperature impact during
[SPEAKER_00]: silking, which is when at least I was
expecting to see the strongest temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, when you look at the entire
population of cultivar, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no significant impact of high
temperatures during silking on yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We broke our data set down to include only
cultivars that had been represented by
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 10-year yield variables,
and then we test them to see if there was
[SPEAKER_00]: any significant cross-effects between
those cultivars and the temperature stress
[SPEAKER_00]: indices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any cultivars have a unique
relationship with temperature stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very many of them, but there was a
handful of cultivars that did appear to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive to high temperatures during the
sensitive period, as we defined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these cultivars that were sensitive,
we saw the most variability in cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: performance only under the no stress
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivars that were significantly
impacted by temperatures during the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive period, they performed about as
well as everybody else under really
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful conditions, but they were the
ones that were over-yielding the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pack under non-stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating this model that looks at cultivar
as a fixed effect, it does not
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly improve our understanding of
the temperature impacts over our model
[SPEAKER_00]: that has it as a fixed effect based on our
model selection process, so I just note
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just more anecdotal, and it
suggests that maybe if there are still
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature-sensitive cultivars out there,
that could be taken into account as part
[SPEAKER_00]: of adaptation mechanisms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last thing that we wanted to see
was by altering our management practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we adapt to our temperature stress
indices as we saw them, even though they
[SPEAKER_00]: were slight?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as we can tell, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here on the left, on your x-axis
here, you have early growth T2-34.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the y-axis here, you have rain-filled
T2-34, and then the z-axis is yield
[SPEAKER_00]: response, and this is under average.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average management, so just the mean of
everything in our data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Average cultivar to maturity, GDD to
maturity, average planting date,
[SPEAKER_00]: average planting rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no stress in early growth,
and then you increase your stress level
[SPEAKER_00]: during grain fill, your yields decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: High stress during early growth,
high stress during grain fill,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a yield boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing over here, except for now we've
created a scenario that we call optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have just slightly increased our
planting date.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've slightly decreased our planting
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've chosen a higher performing cultivar
that performed across a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 33Y75.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on that other graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also a longer season cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that pretty similarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what, you just want to have high
temperatures early in the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes sense because we're talking
about an earlier planting date here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real thing that I wanted to point out
here is that even slightly optimizing from
[SPEAKER_00]: within the range of current cultural
practices, you're on a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: scale than you'd see with your worst-case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst-case scenario with slightly optimal
management doesn't even overlap with
[SPEAKER_00]: best-case scenario average management.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tells us that within the range of
temperature impacts that we're currently
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, and we did see some really high
temperatures in this data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the sky is isn't falling.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not much evidence of temperature
sensitivity in irrigated maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Night temperature was associated with
decreased radiation and also with
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radiation is the most yield-limiting
climate variable that we saw in these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: High temperature reduces the impact from
increased radiation during grain fill,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're not getting as much of that yield
boost from more radiation if it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see that with our observed
temperature impacts, we have evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior temperature regime experienced by
the crop is going to impact whatever its
[SPEAKER_00]: response is to temperatures later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate impacts explain very little yield
variance and can be compensated for by
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly optimizing management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that just kind of brings me to my
final point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlling for soil moisture if you're
going to be doing this type of econometric
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to make yield projections in a
changing climate seems like it could be of
[SPEAKER_00]: some importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank everybody on my
committee and also Peter for all your
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank, I wish he was here,
Erica Murdrock, who was my consultant over
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cornell Statistical Consulting Unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's great if anybody hasn't had a chance
to meet her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
