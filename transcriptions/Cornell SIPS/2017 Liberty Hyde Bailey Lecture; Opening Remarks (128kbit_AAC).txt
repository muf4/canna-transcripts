[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: This annual feature, the Liberty Hyde
Bailey Lecture, features distinguished
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty from the College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences who will be discussing
[SPEAKER_01]: their work, which also highlights key
priority areas for the college.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lecture's namesake, and that is
Liberty Hyde Bailey, was the very first
[SPEAKER_01]: dean of Cornell's New York State College
of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, college was established by the
New York State Legislature in 1904.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you who would like a
little piece of trivia, the iconic Bailey
[SPEAKER_01]: Hall across the street is named after Dean
Liberty Hyde Bailey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Liberty Hyde Bailey had a remarkable
career.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breadth and the diversity of that
career, which mirrors that of Cal's even
[SPEAKER_01]: to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey was a botanist, and a plant
breeder, who played a crucial role in the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of the field of horticulture
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, though, he was a
writer, an editor, a poet, a rural
[SPEAKER_01]: sociologist, a philosopher, a traveler,
and an environmentalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: In his honor, today's panel presentation
is entitled, From Farm to Fork,
[SPEAKER_01]: How Cal's is Leading the Food Revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our college is a strong leader in the food
space, because as with Liberty Hyde
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey, the college has incredible breadth
of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our knowledge base supports all stages of
food production, from basic to
[SPEAKER_01]: translational research, to an extension
network that puts our groundbreaking
[SPEAKER_01]: discoveries into the hands and the fields
of growers and consumers across New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State and well beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's breeding tastier vegetables
and disease-resistant fruits, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: improving the quality and the safety of
our dairy products, or supporting new crop
[SPEAKER_01]: markets that can thrive on the East Coast,
our researchers are demonstrating just how
[SPEAKER_01]: central this college is to the food
revolution, both here in New York State
[SPEAKER_01]: and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now to that end, I would like to
introduce to you today's panelists,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll start with Thomas Bjorkman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a professor of horticulture in the
School of Integrative Plant Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas earned his bachelor's degree from
the University of California Davis and his
[SPEAKER_01]: PhD from Cornell's Plant Biology Program.
[SPEAKER_01]: After conducting postdoctoral studies on
the West Coast, Thomas returned to Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1990, joining the Horticultural
Sciences Department on Cornell's Geneva
[SPEAKER_01]: campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thomas works on many aspects of plant
development that affect the productivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality, the sustainability,
and the profitability of New York-grown
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: He directs the Eastern Broccoli Project,
which seeks to create a reliable,
[SPEAKER_01]: high-quality, year-round supply of
Eastern-grown broccoli for East Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next panelist is Michael Mazurek.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, a plant breeder, is the Calvin
Noizkini Professor of Plant Breeding at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He received his PhD from Cornell in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael's vegetable breeding program uses
traditional methods of cross-pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: to develop new cultivars of squash,
peppers, and many other vegetables for
[SPEAKER_01]: organic farming systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: His process is informed by surveys of the
natural diversity and by studies of the
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying genetics that allow adaptation
of the plant material into naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: managed ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He selects the traits that he's looking
for in the plants, both by what is in
[SPEAKER_01]: demand by growers and by consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, the grower-driven traits
that interest Michael focus on fungal and
[SPEAKER_01]: insect resistances that will work in
regionally adapted backgrounds to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: a reliable and a productive harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the consumer side, his consumer-driven
traits focus on color, quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, and novelty to drive the
consumption of naturally nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next panelist is Carmen Mararu,
and Carmen is a professor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Food Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: She earned her bachelor's and PhD degrees
in food engineering from the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Galate in Romania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carmen's research and teaching interests
are in the areas of physical and
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering properties of food,
of dairy food processing, and food safety
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is specifically interested in
developing and optimizing novel food
[SPEAKER_01]: processing methods to enhance food safety,
quality, and product shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: She also is working on developing
microbial repellent surfaces and on
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and controlling the
intermolecular interactions and structural
[SPEAKER_01]: transformations that occur during the
processing of foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our final panelist is Courtney Weber,
who is a professor in the horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: section of the School of Integrative Plant
Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Courtney grew up on a dairy farm in
central Illinois, and he earned his
[SPEAKER_01]: bachelor of science from the University of
Illinois, but his MS and his PhD both from
[SPEAKER_01]: the University of Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: Courtney has worked at Cornell for 18
years in berry breeding and genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically working on strawberries,
raspberries, and blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: His research uses genomics and molecular
markers to examine genetics and the
[SPEAKER_01]: inheritance of disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: He holds patents on seven berry varieties
that are four strawberries and three
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries, and he has an eighth patent
that is under preparation for the Archer
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, which is his newest variety,
which was just released in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now finally, I would like to introduce
today's moderator, and that is Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Smart is the interim director of the
School of Integrative Plant Science,
[SPEAKER_01]: and she's also a professor of plant
pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: She earned her bachelor's and PhD from
Michigan State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her research seeks to develop improved
management strategies for vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases by increasing our understanding
of pathogen biology and the diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: those pathogens under field conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using this information, she provides
growers with novel disease management
[SPEAKER_01]: options while also promoting sustainable
agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris's outreach efforts also involve
developing partnerships between Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: University and elementary school educators
and students to help increase student
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now, I would like to turn the
program over to Chris Smart and our
[SPEAKER_01]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Dean Bohr.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure for me to moderate the
Liberty Hyde Bailey panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice for me, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter, Stephanie Smart, just
completed her freshman year here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you may have noticed from my bio
that I have no Cornell connections other
[SPEAKER_00]: than by marriage, my husband, Larry Smart,
has his 30th reunion this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a professor in plant breeding and
genetics and got his undergraduate
[SPEAKER_00]: bachelor's degree here in 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry's mom, Marjorie Smart, got her
bachelor's degree from Cornell in 1957.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year is her 60th reunion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marjorie's mother, this is pretty cool,
the family I married into, Florence
[SPEAKER_00]: Nelson, got her bachelor's degree from
Cornell in 1927.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool that my daughter can
be this fourth generation, not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornelian, but a strong tradition of women
in education at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting for me to be a part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this reunion year is really special for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enough about my family history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say that plant and food
science at Cornell has never been more
[SPEAKER_00]: vibrant, nor has it been more important to
our local communities and to people across
[SPEAKER_00]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Dean Bohr mentioned, I'm the interim
director of the School of Integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Science, and that brings together
hundreds of scientists who are
[SPEAKER_00]: researching, teaching, and extending
information about plants and the soils in
[SPEAKER_00]: which they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our research in SIPs, or the School of
Integrative Plant Science, spreads a
[SPEAKER_00]: breadth of topics from fundamental plant
science, how our leaves forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do flowers form, all the way to
solving problems for agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: producers here in New York and around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to hear about some of
the work that faculty members in the
[SPEAKER_00]: School of Integrative Plant Science have
combined with others across CALS,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Carmen, to bring healthy,
safe, and nutritious foods from our farms
[SPEAKER_00]: to our tables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of our panel members will speak for
about 10 minutes, and then we'll move on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next panel member.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the fourth panel member has spoken,
then we'll open up the floor for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll begin today with Michael Mazurek,
who is a professor in Plant Breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
