[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start by demystifying the title a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't reread it to you since Michael
just read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what this means is that
there are individuals of Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: faubus who produce aflatoxin and
individuals that do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both are maintained through
evolutionary time, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: producing aflatoxin must confer a benefit
to the fungus sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not producing the toxin must confer
benefit at other times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just give you a little
outline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with some background on
secondary metabolites in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into background on Aspergillus
faubus and aflatoxins, talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about work we've done in looking at
aflavus population structure, talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the hypotheses behind that we think might
be driving balancing selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and spoiler alert, we think it's insects
and soil microbes, and then concluding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So secondary metabolites are generally
defined as just any compound that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: required for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, in fungi, they've been
hugely diversified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is partially due to the
diversification of polyketide synthetases
[SPEAKER_00]: and non-rhinozomal peptides, peptide
synthetases, amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just because we know of all these
compounds, it doesn't mean that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do for the organisms that
produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, here in Magna Porto Eryzi,
it was discovered that melanin,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we normally think of as a UV
protectant, is also required in appersoria
[SPEAKER_00]: for structural integrity so that it can
actually punch through plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is to say, even when we think we
know what compounds are for, there may be
[SPEAKER_00]: other functions, or we may just be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start off with some things that we
have a sense of what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are host-specific toxins which
determine the host range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine if it produces one of
these compounds, then it's able to infect
[SPEAKER_00]: a new host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that obviously confers a fitness
advantage to the fungus, so it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: selected for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with virulence factors, virulence is
not the same thing necessarily as fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have increased virulence without
increased fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, it does correlate to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it suggests that we have a sense
of what these compounds are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're allowing the fungus to infect a
new plant or to better infect a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and thus reproduce more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of deoxynovalinol,
which is also classified as a mycotoxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's known as a vomit toxin, endearingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again, the way that we find out about
these compounds is because they are toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So passionately, we heard a little bit
about last week, so I had to throw it up
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ergot alkaloids, even back in the 15th
century when Bosch did this painting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that St. Anthony's fire was an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long before we knew that there were
microbes causing these diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew about the compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we knew about the diseases they
cause, and we've gone on to learn about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all from a human perspective
instead of what it does for the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: that produces the compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, of course, important because
mycotoxins contaminate 25% of the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: food supplies, and they cause disease and
stunting of growth and even death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, while that's sad and costly to
everyone involved in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to know is why do the
organisms that produce these compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: produce them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to drive home that we really don't
know what these compounds do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think about antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Antibiotics, if you ask anyone,
why does a bacterium produce antibiotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll say to kill bacteria or a fungus
produce antibiotics, to kill bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that they're effective at
killing bacteria in the lab and medical
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in their natural settings,
so like in soils, the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics are actually sub-inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that they're killing bacteria
has kind of gone out the window as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: antibiotics in their natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, people now believe that they're
used for intra-specific communication in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of brings home the idea that
we have to think about not what these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds are doing to us, but what these
compounds are doing in the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment at the concentrations and in
the context of the natural ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the whole methodology of the
organisms that produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now moving on to the star of the show,
aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflatoxin is an incredibly important
mycotoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the most carcinogenic,
naturally-produced compound, which has
[SPEAKER_00]: been a great line for my elevator speech
when I'm talking about my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects the P53 gene, which regulates
the cell cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it disrupts that, then the cells
become aberrant and just grow out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's especially associated with liver
cancer, which is a particularly nasty one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As such, it's highly regulated by the FDA
in a bunch of crops, including maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton, peanuts, and a variety of tree
nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, as you notice from the title,
we're going to be looking at Aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: flavis, but it's actually produced,
aflatoxins are produced by several species
[SPEAKER_00]: closely related to Aspergillus flavis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see Aspergillus flavis
growing on this ear of corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that it's a
yellowish-green color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be important later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to retain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an infected kernel
fluorescing a bright blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aflatoxin, the one that we're most
interested in, is called B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fluoresces blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the colonies are
yellowish-green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fluoresces blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have Aspergillus flavis
growing on a plate, and we're hitting it
[SPEAKER_00]: with UV light, and it's illuminating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red is just it overloading the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see here is that
different isolates produce different
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two are not producing any.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are producing a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are producing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two are producing just a lot of
aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this illustrates is that only 40%
to 60% of Aspergillus flavis isolates
[SPEAKER_00]: produce aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have looked at the genetic
code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens across the country,
40% to 60% all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, if you look at the genetic code,
you find evidence of balancing selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that this is a persistent
polymorphism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it means that at some point
producing aflatoxin confers a fitness
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point not producing aflatoxin
confers a fitness advantage relative,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, to the other chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really interested in this
balancing selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note that while
balancing selection is rare for secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, as far as we know,
it's not unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichoflescenes, infusarium,
gruminarium are also under balancing
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even here, this is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this balancing selection is for
different chemical profiles as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of an interesting system
in addition to being agriculturally
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mantra today are what are the
ecological factors that are driving
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've been saying, in order to get
at this question, we have to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural ecology of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the natural environment of the fungus
is typically considered soil, where it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces canidophores that disperse spores
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do mean everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a global distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the spores being
distributed everywhere, it can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: crops while they're in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: In maize, it infects the silvers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows through the silk and then gets
into the kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also be a post-harvest issue
because it's just in the air everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we're trying to understand what
aflatoxin is doing for it, we might expect
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxins only to be sequestered in the
sclerotia as overwintering structures to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it didn't give us any kind
of sense of that because the aflatoxins
[SPEAKER_00]: are everywhere in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the canidia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's not as clear cut as just
being a virulence factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like those that produce aflatoxin
can infect a plant and those that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no hints really on what aflatoxin is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is just to give some
background on what the natural ecology is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to look at to understand what
aflatoxins do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't just tell what aflatoxin
is doing by where it sequesters it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus itself, maybe there's global
distribution patterns that can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: start to help us understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, aflatoxin has been known to be more
common in hot, dry areas for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a little unclear if this has to
do with the stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this plant gets stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier to infect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wind up with more aflatoxin
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if this is just a phenomenon where
hotter temperatures at lower latitudes
[SPEAKER_00]: select for aflatoxigenic, while the cooler
latitudes select for non-aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when looking at soil here,
Manabe in 1978 showed that the black
[SPEAKER_00]: portion here is aflatoxigenic,
those that produce aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, he showed that as you go
farther and farther south, this portion is
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing, suggesting that at lower
latitudes in hotter areas, there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: selection for aflatoxin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to follow up on this because
Japan is far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to do it in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed two transects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are roughly of the same latitude
here across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did sampling at all of these
locations with the help of collaborative
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborators who scooped up soil and sent
it to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we isolated them on soil dilution
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a rose bengal plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the yellowish green
colonies here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our aspergillus flava is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it onto a plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can isolate it with a single
canidium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these plates are just really cool
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is we don't see the same
pattern as they saw in Japan 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the eastern transect, we don't see any
real pattern at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lower percentage of aflatoxin
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, in the western transect,
it's going the opposite direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're seeing more aflatoxin
producers towards the north.
[SPEAKER_00]: This to say, there doesn't seem to really
be a clear pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as just in southern
latitudes, where aflatoxin production is
[SPEAKER_00]: favored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not latitude, then what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Janssen, who's an evolutionary
biologist currently at Penn, wrote a paper
[SPEAKER_00]: that suggested that secondary metabolites
in general, and specifically aflatoxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: may be an agent of interference
competition by which you produce these
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals into a substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of claim the substrate
as yours to consume, because nobody else
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to eat it because you poisoned it,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or interference competition can also be
that the compound just keeps down other
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he specifically suggests that this
would be an agent of aflatoxin would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: agent of interference competition for
insects and for soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dan Janssen suggested as an idea,
let's follow this up with a real
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started off with the hypothesis that
aflatoxin production confers an advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: to aflavus in the presence of soil
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this would be through interference
competition, where production in soil kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of carves out some resources for
aspergillus flavus to grow and have higher
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flip side here is that in the
absence of these organisms, so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: absence of soil microbes, or in the
absence of insects, we kind of assume a
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the production of aflatoxin takes
energy, so we just kind of assume a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to say, while we're doing
balancing selection, we're just doing one
[SPEAKER_00]: side of it with these hypothesis right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting with soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to look at soil microbes,
we need some of the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflatoxins are produced in soil,
which is a good first step if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesizing that they have a role in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aflatoxin contamination of soil is
common, both in agriculture, where farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: have to bury really contaminated crops and
the aflatoxins leach into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also just because detritus on the soil
surface can leach aflatoxins into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have found aflatoxins leaching
into the soil and also produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, aflatoxin does have limited toxicity
to microbes, but in some studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does keep down some microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good example of how it's been
used in microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, bacillus and
aspergillus flavus have this relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: where bacillus produces compounds that are
very inhibitory to aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aspergillus flavus produces aflatoxin,
which seems to have the biggest effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacillus species specifically of the
microbes that people have tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at whether or not aflatoxin
production confers a benefit in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, we took a falcon tube and we
put soil in the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this soil was either autoclaved or
not autoclaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also tried gamma irradiating it,
and the fungus didn't grow any differently
[SPEAKER_00]: in gamma irradiated soil from autoclaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And autoclaving is a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we either, in some experiments,
we added toxin or we did not add toxin to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was both to sterile soil or
non-sterile soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we have to add the
fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added a bunch of isolates
separately, either non-toxigenic or
[SPEAKER_00]: toxigenic isolates to these tubes under
these conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would extract the DNA and use
qPCR to quantify the amount of DNA that
[SPEAKER_00]: was present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of a proxy for fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more DNA that's present,
the more that it's growing, the higher the
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be important later.
[SPEAKER_00]: My graphs are going to say relative
fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: QPCR, you quantify things relative to a
standard curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So relative fitness just means a
measurement relative to a curve on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just think of them as fitness
numbers, but it'll say relative fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at HPLC to quantify the
aflatoxin, make sure it was producing
[SPEAKER_00]: under some of our conditions, and make
sure that our addition of aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: stayed, actually happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for a subset of the samples,
we did amplicon sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To look at the microbial communities and
try to understand what both the addition
[SPEAKER_00]: of aflatoxins and the ability of the
fungus to produce aflatoxins, what effect
[SPEAKER_00]: that had, if any, on the microbial
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, to show you, this is what the
microcosms look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the falcon tubes that I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a close-up inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we added a little bit of maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see a maize bit with
aspergillus flavus, knidia force,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our non-autoclaved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be considered natural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here there's a penicillium
species coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We often see a whole bunch of different
species that we haven't really identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll talk about some of the
composition in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at three different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 25 natural and sterile,
37 natural and sterile, and 42 natural and
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you immediately notice is that
the 42 is a stressful condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even under the sterile condition,
the growth is way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at 37 and 25, the growth is more or
less the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: These in sterile are significantly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're interested in the question of
what does aflatoxin do for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it grow differently in the sterile or
at different temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was initially what we were doing
because we didn't know what we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, let's look at all the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is that in the natural
soil, we consistently see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-aflatoxigenic have higher fitness than
the aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not producing aflatoxin seems to confer
a benefit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is only in the natural soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the sterile soils,
there's no clear pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, the non-aflatoxigenic has a little
bit higher mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's the aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, they're exactly identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But across the natural soils, there was a
significant difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-aflatoxigenic and the aflatoxigenic
fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the opposite of what we
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected aflatoxin to keep down other
soil microbes, allowing it to colonize
[SPEAKER_00]: more food and grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is experiment one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really believe that this was a
real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time, we were like, we're going
to hit it with a ton of aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, we'll definitely see the effect
that we were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have a different and
independent set of isolates grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, in natural and sterile conditions,
natural and sterile, this time with the
[SPEAKER_00]: addition of aflatoxin in these two and no
aflatoxin added here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this independent experiment in
sterile, that was at 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: So note that the best growth was at 37,
so it was easiest to work with the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at 37.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see the same pattern that in natural
soil, we see a significant difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between non-aflatoxigenic and
aflatoxigenic isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it looks like the same patterns here
in sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference was not significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, again, surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to do it a third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what this graph is is it's the 37
degree from the first experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already seen this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 37 degree natural without toxin
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, adding the toxin, as you can see
from the fact that these are the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: had no effect at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from the previous graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did it a third time with
another independent set of isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across all of these, we again see a
significant difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic
isolates with the non-aflatoxigenic
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates having higher fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, aflatoxigenic isolates
have a fitness cost instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesized fitness benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this seems to only occur in natural
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we only got significant
differences in natural soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the addition of aflatoxin to the soils
had no effect at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we were really surprised by this,
we had to ask, why is aflatoxin so costly
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce in soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first piece of the puzzle,
what we did was we added aflatoxin to
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we measured it over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that, so here you
have the dotted lines are sterile soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the solid lines are non-natural soils
at three different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is even in the dotted
sterile conditions, aflatoxin is degraded
[SPEAKER_00]: at a really high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from about 2,000 parts per
million aflatoxin in the soil to even a
[SPEAKER_00]: little over 1,000 in just about four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is degrading aflatoxin really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we think that this might be such
quick degradation that it's difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus to produce enough toxin to keep
up with the rate at which it's degraded in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this starts to paint a picture of maybe
why aflatoxin is not a great thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: not great for fitness in a soil
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we wanted to look at the impact on
microbial composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are NMDS plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, I don't want to get into it
too much, but it's a multivariate analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: to look at the community structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want you to see here is that we
have added toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the producing ability of
the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So added toxin circles is no added toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangles is added toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with blue and green, ah,
I forgot this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus is green, but it produces a
toxin that fluoresces blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the presentation,
when there's blue, it's aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's green, it's not producing the
toxin that fluoresces blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's non-aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green is not producing it by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that these points
are just all on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you get the producers going
up this way and the non-producers going
[SPEAKER_00]: over this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is the fungal community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacterial community is even more
so just completely on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a visualization of the
fact that we found no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference either with the addition of
aflatoxin or with the ability to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin of the fungus itself on
microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember, we had a specific idea that
maybe bacillus would be the answer to our
[SPEAKER_00]: questions of why aflatoxin might confer a
benefit, which it doesn't, in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this is, is it's demonstrating the
log base two fold change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are actually small changes across
all of the different phyla of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: that we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each spot here is an OTU, which for
practical purpose you can think of as a
[SPEAKER_00]: species, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within each one of these, each dot
represents a species of this phylum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much it changed from its
abundance from not having an aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: producer, so a non-aflatoxigenic isolate,
to having an aflatoxigenic isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much did it change in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is that here in the
firmicutes, which is where bacillus is,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no significant difference between
the prevalence of bacillus in microcosms
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated with aflavis that produces
aflatoxin and those in non-aflatoxigenic
[SPEAKER_00]: microcosms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we didn't find any species,
fungal or bacterial, that changed
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly between any of our
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really seems that the addition of
aflatoxin and the aflatoxin producing
[SPEAKER_00]: ability has very little effect on soil
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we found, instead of finding a
fitness benefit to aflatoxin production,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found a fitness cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, at the beginning I was
saying, for balancing selection to be
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained, you need the non-aflatoxigenic
to be favored under some conditions and
[SPEAKER_00]: the aflatoxigenic to be favored under
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we're creating an environment in
the soil when competing with microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: where not producing the toxin confers a
benefit, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be because aflatoxin doesn't
seem to have much effect in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's degraded quickly, as I showed you,
and it doesn't seem to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial community composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I mentioned earlier,
the most likely explanation for this is
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the soil environment that is low
in nutrients and they're competing with
[SPEAKER_00]: other microbes, the cost, the metabolic
cost of producing aflatoxin may result in
[SPEAKER_00]: a fitness loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the simplest explanation for
why this is happening, why there'd be the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to the isolates that don't produce
the toxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so our first hypothesis was about
soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not find a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll have a benefit in the presence
of insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insects have a known association with
Aspergillus flavis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's insect infestations in the
field, it creates openings where
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus flavis can get in and infect
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in stored grain environments,
it's known that insects like maize weevils
[SPEAKER_00]: can vector it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go through their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can come out in their frass,
the spore survive, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of this, their insects
are often associated with increased
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, aflatoxin is toxic to a
large number of invertebrates in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of these studies that have added
aflatoxins to food have looked at what
[SPEAKER_00]: effect it has on fungal fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've just been poisoning insects and
invertebrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this photo to show you, to kind of
depict that any time I go out for a walk
[SPEAKER_00]: in the woods, I always see some kind of
invertebrate on a mushroom when I come
[SPEAKER_00]: across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a lot of this kind of
interaction where invertebrates are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to look at whether or not
aflatoxin production through interference
[SPEAKER_00]: competition would allow it to claim the
resources that we give it better than its
[SPEAKER_00]: non-aflatoxigenic counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similarly, I'm going to start off with
telling you the methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we use little microcentrifuge tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a little bit of food in the bottom
of it that both Drosophila larvae and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus could eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the food, we either did or did not
add aflatoxins, similar to the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we added, we did or did not add
larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to a single microcentrifuge tube,
we'd add up to nine larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we either added an aflatoxin and an
aflatoxigenic or non-aflatoxigenic
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate, very similar construction to the
last set of experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And extracted DNA using qPCR as a proxy
for fitness again, and HPLC to quantify
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you a sense of what this looks
like, here's the microcentrifuge tube,
[SPEAKER_00]: way zoomed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the food at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here, the green is
the fungus, as you will remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here on the sides are some Drosophila
larvae that have started to pupate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here in the middle, this kind of
white structure, is a Drosophila larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: that did not bear so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have mostly died there,
didn't make it to pupation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that we need to figure
out is, is aflatoxin toxic to our model
[SPEAKER_00]: organism?
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the course of 20 days,
we grew, we raised Drosophila larvae on
[SPEAKER_00]: food containing increasing amounts of
aflatoxin, or aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we looked at the number of
Drosophila larvae that pupated and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the number that emerged as adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the takeaway from this is,
yes, as aflatoxin concentration increases,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number that pupate and the number that
emerges as adults goes way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aflatoxin is toxic to our model
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is just poisoning insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't tell us anything about the
fungus and what we want to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not this confers, aflatoxin
confers an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to bring home that it's toxic,
here are Drosophila larvae in our model
[SPEAKER_00]: systems here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here you can see the mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these black dots in the middle are an
immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a melanization that's either due
to a direct response to aflatoxin or
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue damage caused by aflatoxin that
then elicits an immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is toxic to our model
organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case you were not convinced,
this is now four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one was 20 days, which is why
when we don't add the fungus, we don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: the drop off in number of living larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number of living larvae over aflatoxin
concentrations before what we saw over 20
[SPEAKER_00]: days, it dropped off dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in four days, they survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell in the tubes that they're not
as happy, but they don't die within that
[SPEAKER_00]: span of time, unless the fungus is
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we inoculated non-aflatoxigenic,
which is green, and aflatoxigenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that without any added
toxin to the food, there's a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in how many larvae survive
living in the tube with the fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the aflatoxigenic killing more of the
larvae than the non-aflatoxigenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might expect, as you add
aflatoxin to the tube, the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin decreases, and they become more
similar because now there's aflatoxin in
[SPEAKER_00]: both of these tubes, where here there was
no aflatoxin at all before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this tells us nothing about our
main hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows that when grown with the
fungus, the larvae die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten to the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the fitness of the fungus,
as measured by QPCR, over increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have tubes that have larvae and
tubes that do not have larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tubes that do not have larvae seem
to have no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's no change statistically
across the increasing aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just adding aflatoxin to the tube does
not increase fitness of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the presence of larvae,
you can see with the nine larvae competing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fungus, there's a dramatic
reduction in fungal biomass compared to no
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is ameliorated and becomes clear
as the aflatoxin concentration increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, these last two points here at
about 1.7 parts per million are not
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different, whereas these two
are about 20 times different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding aflatoxin to the medium clearly
increases fungal fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're interested in if the
fungus's production of aflatoxin can
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the aflatoxigenic and
non-aflatoxigenic isolates were not
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even kind of see that they're just
on top of each other throughout this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to kind of visualize what this
difference looks like, here's a tube with
[SPEAKER_00]: no added aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see a bunch of the white food
shining through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 1.75 parts per million aflatoxin
added to the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lush green-yellow matte is
Aspergillus flavus canidiating all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larvae have all died, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we were adding toxin to the
tubes, we wanted to ask, does the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: production by the fungus itself have an
effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we just did non-aflatoxigenic and
aflatoxigenic isolates without aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: added to the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is no significant
difference between their growth when no
[SPEAKER_00]: larvae are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the presence of larvae,
we do see a significant difference with
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxigenic isolates having slightly
higher fitness than non-aflatoxigenic
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a little bit shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from having this kind of
visualizable difference, 20-fold
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, to just kind of eking out a
difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to ask, why is the
difference so small?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have to remember is that
Aspergillus flavus doesn't just produce
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also produces a bunch of toxic
compounds like kojic acid, cyclopea,
[SPEAKER_00]: zonic acid, and alpha trim, all of which
are known to be toxic to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to remember that both the
non-aflatoxigenic and the aflatoxigenic
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates may be producing these compounds
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the amount of aflatoxin that are
isolates produced varied 1,000-fold,
[SPEAKER_00]: from eight parts per billion to eight
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So caught up in this difference is a lot
of the variation between isolates and what
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds they're producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even how much aflatoxin or
aflatoxigenic isolates are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: For context, eight parts per billion,
you could eat corn that was infected with
[SPEAKER_00]: that level in the US, not in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the US, it's regulated at 20 parts
per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a significant effect,
a much smaller effect on fitness,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fungus producing aflatoxin in the
microcosms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is going on in these microcosms?
[SPEAKER_00]: We said that this was an interference
competition hypothesis, by which it would
[SPEAKER_00]: claim resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to show you here is
there's a Drosophila larva here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see its mouth parts, the little
black parts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up here, we have Ashbrozillus
canidiiophores coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it reaches up to the
canidiiophore and bites it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twice more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really gets it back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this tells us is that this
competition isn't just competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also fungivory going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be an interference competition
story, but there might also be an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-fungivory story going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't wind up separating those.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we kind of think that when the
fungus is growing, growing through a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, it might be inextricable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't separate what's fungivory and
what's competition for resources because
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus has grown through all of the
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what this does show us is that there's
a direct eating of the fungus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which got us interested in what effect
that might have on the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were surprised to see that with
larva present, isolates produced on
[SPEAKER_00]: average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is aflatoxin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: No larva added to the tubes, larva added
to the tubes, and simulated damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I took a toothpick twice
a day for four days and stabbed each tube
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 times to simulate the kind of little
mouth parts that Drosophila larva would be
[SPEAKER_00]: eating the fungus with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with no larva, they produce a
baseline amount of aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a single larva, because if I added
nine larva, it decreased the biomass so
[SPEAKER_00]: much that it was really difficult to
compare between things.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a single larva, it increases
aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I stab it with a toothpick,
it really does not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows us is that this is
consistent with an induced resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: response, that it knows that it's being
eaten, so it produces aflatoxin to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to note that because
it also does this just when I stab it with
[SPEAKER_00]: a toothpick, just when it's physically
damaged, not only when the larva does it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not clear that this is necessarily an
evolved adaptive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could just be that when I damage it,
it releases oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oxidative stress is known to increase
aflatoxin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this could just be that when you
damage it, it produces more aflatoxin,
[SPEAKER_00]: not that it's an evolved relationship
between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize, as we started out with,
aflatoxin is toxic to our model organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aflatoxin, when added to the medium,
dramatically increases the fitness of
aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspergillus flavis, but this is true for
both tox and non-tox.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just shows us that it increases fungal
fitness in the presence of insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not in their absence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we showed that the production of
aflatoxin by the fungus itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: without us adding it, also increases
fungal fitness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you recall, it was just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the graph that I was
just showing you, aflatoxin production is
[SPEAKER_00]: increased when fungus is physically
damaged, consistent with an induced
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with insects, balancing selection could
also be maintained by the variability in
[SPEAKER_00]: how susceptible insects are to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried similar experiments with maize
weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were resistant to aflatoxin up to
40 times the concentration we used for
[SPEAKER_00]: drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just gave up at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just didn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine if you're producing
aflatoxin and there's a resistant insect,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not confer the benefit that it
does if there's a susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a susceptible one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although we were unable to show a
fitness cost in the second experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we think that has to do with the nutrient
richness of the medium, rather than that
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't a cost to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw it in the soils, but not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this mean for balancing
selection overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a piece of organic matter
on the soil surface, fungus comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The non-aflatoxigenic isolates will do
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So non-aflatoxigenic are favored when
competing with soil microbes for
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: When competing with insects, however,
the production of aflatoxin benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: and aflatoxigenic individuals are favored.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have everything going on all at
once, we have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on how strong these
factors are in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this does not preclude aflatoxin
from having other functions in other
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it needs to be field tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I mean by we don't know
what the relative strength of these
[SPEAKER_00]: factors are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's both insects and soil
microbes present, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've emphasized the potential for
insect control to be good for aflatoxin
[SPEAKER_00]: reductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while it was known that insects
vectored aspergillus flavus before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was not known that they could actually
increase the amount of toxin that an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual would produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly for our questions,
this presents a conceptual framework that
[SPEAKER_00]: could explain what maintains balancing
selection for aflatoxin production in
[SPEAKER_00]: aspergillus flavus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'd like to thank all of
the people who helped us collect soil with
[SPEAKER_00]: whom we couldn't have gotten the isolates,
my committee members, Brian Lozaro and
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Nelson, funding from USDAFRI,
and my lab members and other collaborators
[SPEAKER_00]: on these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I would take any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are the molecular underpinnings of
being able to produce versus not produce
[SPEAKER_02]: aflatoxin?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how selection is executed at the
molecular level in terms of recombination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question was, what are the
molecular underpinnings of being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce aflatoxin or not being able to
produce aflatoxin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what effect that might have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aflatoxin gene cluster is composed
of 25 genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ways that non-aflatoxigenic
isolates become non-aflatoxigenic varies a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some consistency, but it can go
from a single nucleotide polymorphism to
[SPEAKER_00]: missing the entire cluster, and then just
about everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: As to what effect having many of the genes
versus missing the whole cluster has on
[SPEAKER_00]: fitness, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just found out that producing the
toxin versus not has this effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little unclear if there's a
difference between retaining some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genes or not in the cluster.
Andy?
[SPEAKER_05]: So following up on that, you're comparing
two strains that are genetically
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: One can produce and one cannot produce.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how do you deal with the challenge of
any other genetic differences that are
[SPEAKER_05]: present in two strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of these experiments were was...
Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, if we're comparing one
aflatoxigenic and one non-aflatoxigenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we get at the diversity that might
underpin differences between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: groups in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the answer to that is that we've...
So we've sampled field isolates,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in these experiments, we've used more
than one isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each experiment, I think, had a minimum
of four or five of each type of isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hope with that, that we've captured
some of the diversity and seen that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hearing that aflatoxin is much more
stable in the food substrate than it is in
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, even sterile soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any explanations for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, why might aflatoxin
be more stable in food than in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have a great answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is a really nasty place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's known that humic acids and
things and all of the compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in soils make it really difficult
for compounds to persist there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know specifically what could
be happening compared to in foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about microbes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it could be, but it was even in the
sterile soil, so... If aflatoxin is such a
[SPEAKER_03]: toxic material, do you have to exercise
special techniques to protect yourself and
[SPEAKER_03]: others in the lab from possible toxicity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we followed... We use a biosafety
cabinet when working with the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real issue with aflatoxin is when it's
ingested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to refrain from eating any
contaminated substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still were careful with it,
working with it in a biosafety cabinet and
[SPEAKER_00]: using gloves whenever using the pure
aflatoxin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the FDA inspect you at the lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: EH&S did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been all over us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vicki, do you think with the corn borer
was the second insect you tried,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think that insects that are more
likely to come in contact with aspergillus
[SPEAKER_01]: would have evolved some aflatoxin
resistance compared to the drosophila
[SPEAKER_01]: larvae?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think just larvae are
susceptible to stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the maze weevil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, might insects that are
more likely to interact with aspergillus
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field, more likely to be resistant
to aflatoxin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't be surprised if that were
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a lot of variation in
how susceptible they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the corn armyworm is
susceptible to aflatoxin within the range
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were looking at with drosophila.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a few other agriculturally
relevant organisms that are susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxin within the range that we looked
at.
