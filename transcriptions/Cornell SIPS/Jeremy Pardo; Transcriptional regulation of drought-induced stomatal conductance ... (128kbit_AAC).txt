[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our last presenter is Jeremy Pardo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's from Westinghills, New York,
and he was advised by Karen Bowley and Ed
[SPEAKER_03]: Buckland on this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: As he graduates in a couple weeks,
Jeremy is going to go on to a PhD program
[SPEAKER_03]: in plant biology at Michigan State,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the center of our title is
Transitional Regulation of Drug-Induced
[SPEAKER_03]: Domodal Closure in the Maize-Nam
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's seven times.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a tiny bit of his data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really had to work with people within.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a PhD project.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 12 minutes, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Mike said, my name is Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the last couple of years,
I've been working on my honors thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: under the supervision of Ed Buckler and
Taryn Barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I really want to do is look at
how the transcript dome is involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating stomodal closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's use the computer because it works
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to do is look at these
three aspects of how a plant works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the physiology and then the
transcriptome mix, so mRNA, and then try
[SPEAKER_00]: and integrate that together with some
genetic mapping to really get at how
[SPEAKER_00]: stomodal closure under drought is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is this stomodal closure that
I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So stomates are pores on leaves,
and plants can close them in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: water stress to limit water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by closing them, they also limit
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant hormone, abscisic acid,
is very much involved in mediating this
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that hormone is also really
important in controlling other genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: responses to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should mention that there are
drought response mechanisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: independent of abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the hormone ethylene plays a
major role too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for today, I'm going to focus on
abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plant material that I used,
for my experiments, was taken from the
[SPEAKER_00]: maize nested association mapping
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lines that you see up on your
screen are the founders of this
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 27 inbred corn lines from around
the world that represent the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: maize as best as you can with 27 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see the two that are
highlighted in red were the parents for
[SPEAKER_00]: the mapping population for that portion of
my experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I conducted two separate
experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I'll refer to as the quantitative
trait mapping experiment, and the other as
[SPEAKER_00]: the RNA sequencing experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for both of them, I grew plants for
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took the seedlings,
and I started to drought stress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the quantitative trait mapping,
experiment on what I call day zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had three week old plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were well watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started measuring some physiological
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by day one, I stopped watering
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept measuring those traits each
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, on day four of that
experiment, I rewatered them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: measured again to see how the plants
responded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the RNA sequencing experiment,
it was a very similar design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I had two groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the control group was always well
watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the drought stress group, very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day zero, they're well watered plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by day one, I've withheld water,
and they're starting to become drought
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on day one and day three of that
experiment, I collected leaf tissue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those physiological measurements,
here's just an example of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the white little clamp device is called
a parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it measures still model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically measuring the flow rate
through the stomates, which is a measure
[SPEAKER_00]: of how open they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more open the stomates,
in general, the less drought stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other device on there with
the little prongs is not a torture
[SPEAKER_00]: implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soil electrical conductivity meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so I used that to measure the
water content of the soil to get an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of how drought stress my plants actually
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for RNA sequencing, I used a
method that was adapted to plants by Carl
[SPEAKER_00]: Kremling to do three prime RNA sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, all you need to know about
that is it's a way to cheaply and quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: profile the RNA from a whole bunch of
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to this physiology, mRNA,
and genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, I'm going to discuss the
physiological results that I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this graph is showing the still
model conductance of those NAM parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red boxes are the control group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those were always well watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the blue boxes are my drought stress
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I withheld water from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is by day one of my
experiment, there's a significant decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: in still model conductance in the drought
stress group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might also see that there's still
a lot of variation on day one between
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plot is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just showing the data, the same
trait, the still model conductance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in my quantitative trait mapping
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, by day one of the experiment,
there's a significant decrease in still
[SPEAKER_00]: model conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also still a lot of variation
between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to look a little bit at that variation
between genotypes, so this plot is showing
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of still model conductance on
day one to day zero for all of those lines
[SPEAKER_00]: in my RNA sequencing experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the battery in this is dead,
so the pointer won't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see is that, yes,
there's a lot of variation within
[SPEAKER_00]: genotypes, but also between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red line represents a ratio of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would mean that there was no
change between day zero and day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything below that line means that
the still model conductance decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above that line would mean that
it increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that basically all of the
genotypes are decreasing their still model
conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them are right around that red
line, whereas some of them have decreased
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically already by day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to sum up my physiological results,
I found that still model conductance
[SPEAKER_00]: decreases significantly under drought
stress, but there is a lot of variation
[SPEAKER_00]: between genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to sort of get at what that
variation means, I wanted to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcriptional control of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started wading into my RNA-seq data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this plot is showing is that
it's a principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that is is a way of reducing
very high dimensional data down into two
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put it on a graph and sort of
make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of the points in purple are the
day three drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green are the day one drought
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then red and blue are the control
samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that on day three,
there's sort of a cluster all the way over
[SPEAKER_00]: on this side of the graph, whereas the
controls are on the opposite side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day one samples, their expression
is somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, the gene expression of
my samples is clustering by treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of leads me to believe that
the treatment is having a major effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: that gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I look at genes that were
differentially expressed between the
[SPEAKER_00]: control group and the drought stress group
on day one of the experiment, what I found
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot of enrichment for genes that are
involved in stress tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems that the plants are responding to
drought stress, which is what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to go from sort of general
overviews of the expression to highly
[SPEAKER_00]: specific one gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plot is showing the expression
of the rate limiting enzyme in abscisic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see is that on both days,
during drought stress, it is significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: more expressed than under control
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that suggests to me that if the
plant is up-rating the expression of an
[SPEAKER_00]: ABA biosynthesis enzyme, that it's
probably producing more abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I mentioned earlier,
abscisic acid is really important in
[SPEAKER_00]: stomatal closure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works through this complicated
signal transduction pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ends in stomatal closure at the end
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting, highlighted in
that red box, is protein phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is it negatively
regulates the abscisic acid signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the expression of just one
of those protein phosphatase genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a whole family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that nine of them were
differentially expressed under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one of them, which has
already been shown to be an important
[SPEAKER_00]: negative regulator of that pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, it's also expressed
more under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant is making more abscisic acid,
but it's also making more of a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator of the abscisic acid signaling
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to know what is coordinate
this delicate balance between the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation of this pathway and the
up-regulation of the pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the answer, I think, lies in
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at all of the
transcription factors that were
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that there were 500 different
transcription factors that were
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed on at least one
of the days under drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did is correlate their
expression pattern with the stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that 30 of them are
significantly associated with stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then among those, I had enrichment for
these two general families of
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factors, so the heat shock
transcription factor family and the BZIP
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so heat shock transcription factors
are known to be involved in a stress
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the BZIP family is one of the largest
transcription factor families in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a subset of them that are very
important in regulating abscisic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid-related processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'd look at those a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just one example of one of
the BZIP transcription factors that was
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that on both day one and
on day three, there's much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this BZIP-68 is regulated by
abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it controls
chlorophyll degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is that related to drought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, under drought stress, as I
mentioned, the stomates close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that limits photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't affect how light is
absorbed by chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that results in damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the responses that the plant
has is to degrade some chlorophyll to
[SPEAKER_00]: limit the damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that was really interesting,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to integrate that a little
more with what is controlling stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at my genetic mapping
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you remember, that was a separate
experiment using a population that was
[SPEAKER_00]: derived from two of those parents where I
had RNA sequencing data for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked on both day one and day
three and tried to correlate stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance with genetic markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a Manhattan plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each dot represents a SNP marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the higher the dots are above the
line, the more associated they are with
[SPEAKER_00]: stomato conductance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found is that I had a
significant region of the genome on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 8 that was significantly
associated with stomato conductance on day
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I looked at day three,
I found something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I had one really peak on there that
stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time it was on chromosome 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that I have these
transcriptional data and the physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: data, as well as this genetic mapping
data, I want to look at how this all comes
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the intersection of all of these
aspects of the plant's growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did is look in my RNA
sequencing data, which, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a separate experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I looked in the regions that were
significantly associated with stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance from the genetic mapping
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on day one, I did find that there
were genes differentially expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, they're uncharacterized
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have no idea what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not going to talk about them
any further today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to ask me about them later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on day three, there were two genes
within that chromosomal region on
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome 2 that was significantly
associated with stomato conductance that
[SPEAKER_00]: were also differentially expressed under
drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of them in particular is this
HVA22-like protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that is, if you can see,
is differentially expressed under drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's expressed more under drought
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at those little red and
blue dots, which are the parents of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping population, it's kind of hard to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But under control conditions, they're at
sort of opposite ends of the expression
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't seem to be at opposite ends
under drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least under control conditions,
there seems to be a big difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: my two parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gene is differentially expressed
under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it is in barley, this HVA22 is
a programmed cell death inhibitor that is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive to the hormone upsizic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the way seed germination in barley
works is there's a layer of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: called the alluron layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the seed germinates, there's
programmed cell death and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are released that degrade the seed
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see the, unfortunately this
pointer's not working, but if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle box on the bottom there,
you see that you have these circles with
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in them, because basically the
cell has died and all of the goop has been
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you have over expression of the
HVA22 protein, you can see that the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: is not dead and it looks the same as the
control conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this gene is inhibiting programmed
cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I am hypothesizing that in leaves,
this HVA22 like protein might inhibit
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed cell death that's involved in
senescence, which we know is triggered in
[SPEAKER_00]: part by drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to sum up what I've told you
so far, the key ABA biosynthesis gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: differentially expressed under drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's up-regulated, but so are negative
regulators of the upsizic acid signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my best candidate for the chromosomal
region that was associated with stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance is an upsizic acid responsive
protein that seems to be an inhibitor of
[SPEAKER_00]: programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the future, what I'm going to do
this summer is look for common motifs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the promoters of all of the genes that I
found that were differentially expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: under drought and hope to find these
sequences that are associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: binding of transcription factors that
maybe are controlling drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finally, I would like to thank
everybody who made this project possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: so especially my two advisors,
Ed Buckler and Taryn Barrelly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In experiments where a dry-down cycle has
been done, you know, limited pot boiling,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes what can happen is that lines
that just generally are runts that have
[SPEAKER_02]: very low rates of photosynthesis and low
stomatal conductance will remain well
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrated even after three days,
while the ones that are really healthy and
[SPEAKER_02]: are transpiring rapidly deplete the water
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can get some, it's hard to
interpret data like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering whether you feel that your
system was a set of lines that didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: those kinds of variations in the control
transfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely that variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did to control for that,
at least for the genetic mapping
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, I included, I measured plant
height and leaf number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of merged that together into
a leaf area like factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I included that in the model when I
was doing the genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was my attempt to control for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it is still a major problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I were to do the experiment all
over again, I would probably use a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: pot volume simply because that would help
to mitigate that factor.
So
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually both upregulated by day
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't have, I only had two time
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I had measured expression every
hour, there could have been like more
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way I didn't go into it,
but the way that ABA works is it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: inactivates the PP2C inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one reason that this might be
occurring is it's upregulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative regulator so that as soon as the
drought stress goes away, the response can
[SPEAKER_00]: be turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be more of a drought recovery
mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just a guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's thank Jeremy again.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
