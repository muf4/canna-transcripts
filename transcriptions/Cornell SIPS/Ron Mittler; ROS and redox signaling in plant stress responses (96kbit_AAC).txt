[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will talk about reactive oxygen
species and about stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will basically talk first about raw
signaling, then about stress combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will try to put these two
together under the umbrella of the one
[SPEAKER_00]: word, one health hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start talking about reactive
oxygen species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I listed some of them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're partly reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are activated forms of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're byproducts of aerobic metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can be toxic to cells,
especially in the presence of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the famous or infamous Fenton
reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people think that raws are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the early 80s, they got a
really bad reputation, work from Lester
[SPEAKER_00]: Pecker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people were taking a lot of
antioxidants, really unneeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so in recent years,
we have really a new view of raws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually good and required for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is depiction of the level of
raws in the cell, if the level of raws
[SPEAKER_00]: will go too low, the cell will go into a
cytostatic state, won't be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too high, we'll go into a
cytotoxic state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you keep raws at the redox biology
range, then raws, and especially hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: peroxide, are very important signal
destruction molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They regulate protein structure function
by oxidative post-translational molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: They regulate modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they regulate transcription factor,
kinases, phosphatases, channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and many other proteins, and regulate a
lot of important processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you keep raws in the redox
biology range?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is sort of the five principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remind people of HMSA, five principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You control the rate of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You control the rate of scavenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also control the rate of
transport, because you can transport
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide out of different
organelles, or even outside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to chelate free metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to constantly repair damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do all these five processes all
the time, then raws really are very
[SPEAKER_00]: important signal and transduction
molecules in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we all know, the plant environment
can be really dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be extreme changes in different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go into all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to survive, plants need to acclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that plants do to
acclimate is systemic signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And systemic signaling is defined as the
ability of plant to mobilize a signal from
[SPEAKER_00]: a small group of cells, let's say these
cells, that experience a signal,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a stress, or a stimuli, to the rest of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, this can be triggered by
different stimuli, biotic, abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this signal reaches the systemic
tissue, it will trigger acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will mainly talk about systemic acquired
acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also systemic acquired
resistance, systemic wound response I will
[SPEAKER_00]: mention too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been studied extensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of long distance systemic signals
are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones, electric signals, calcium wave,
Ross wave, pH waves, peptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of work summarizing in this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mention that they can be
moving from a leaf to the shoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the root, from the root to a whole
shoot, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this talk I'm going to focus primarily
on the Ross wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a process that my lab
discovered in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the Ross wave?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a cell-to-cell signaling
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this pathway, if a cell starts making
Ross, the cell next to it will sense it
[SPEAKER_00]: and start making Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will propagate like this
throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm saying autocatalytic is
I can come centimeters away from where I
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can do a grafting experiment,
or put an inhibitor, and I can block it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really not diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rate is about 0.2 to 0.5
centimeters per minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on the enzymes called
ARBOs, respiratory burst oxidase homologs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In leaf, it's DNF, equivalent of NOx5 in
mammalian.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plasma membrane protein that use
an ADPH to make superoxide in the apoplast
[SPEAKER_00]: that then dismutates to hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said before, this is not
diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is the local tissue and this is
the systemic, Ross are not made in the
[SPEAKER_00]: local and diffuse all the way to the
systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically almost impossible
because they will get scavenged along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not diffusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is, you can think of it as a
binary code.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cell can be either at a resting state,
a 0, or an activated state, a high Ross
[SPEAKER_00]: producing cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when a cell sends, like this cell will
sense now that the cell preceding it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross, it will start making Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will propagate like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ross are not diffusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's moving is information in the form
of altered Ross production from low or low
[SPEAKER_00]: to high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can view it as like a domino
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these cells are already making
Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the front of the wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next cell will start making Ross
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these cells will start making Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will keep making Ross sometimes
for hours, depending on the physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will acclimate to stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have done a lot of studies about
the Ross wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that it does a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It coordinates many physiological
responses, molecular, metabolic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It integrates different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to show all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required for acclimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show two examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of stomatal
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can take an Arabidopsis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can shine light through a LED fiber
optic, highlight or excess light on this
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stomata will close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will also close within minutes in a
systemic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not only one systemic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do it somewhere for this leaf,
all these leaves will close their stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I heat the leaf, I give it a heat
stress, all of them will close.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is mediated by the Ross wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without the Ross wave, you don't have that
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of like the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a coordinate, the response of the
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to say it's like a coral,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cells are responding in unison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an important role of the Ross
wave, coordinating physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another experiment is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take an Arabidopsis plant and I shine
highlight only on this leaf, and then I do
[SPEAKER_00]: a transcriptomic analysis at 0,
2, 4, and 8 minutes of this leaf and a
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic leaf, and I can see that
altogether there is a very good overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a systemic response that
will make this leaf now acclimated to
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can then take these transcripts at
the local and the systemic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can do clustering to, let's say,
these are the transiently responding
[SPEAKER_00]: transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is this overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want you to remember this number,
2,300, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happened to this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do this in a mutant that have a very
suppressed Ross wave, Arbodee,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost no Ross wave whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes down to 6, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Ross wave is really important for
coordinating rapid responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have an overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have acclimation anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have rapid responses that
are transmitted from the local leaf to the
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we discovered that, we used
transgenic plants that have the Zatwell
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter fused to luciferase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want to discover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to develop a system where we can
screen for mutants that are deficient in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we discovered that there is a systemic
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, this does not really
measure Ross, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I moved six years ago to Missouri,
I purchased this imager.
[SPEAKER_00]: This imager is used for mammalian work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Ivis lumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's used to image.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to image.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can inject, for example, RFP-labeled
cancer cells under the skin of a mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can follow their migration,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we developed methods to image whole
plants, live whole plants growing in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: for Ross, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is shown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, these two plants were treated
with a dye called DCF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trick is we don't spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fumigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take nebulizers, medical nebulizers,
that create the mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the plants in this mist for half an
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They soak in the dye, whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We treat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them in the imager, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk more about this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, you can see that I
stimulate this leaf with highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the Ross in the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, again, are plants just growing
in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can dip this leaf in a mixture of
bacteria that will give a hypersensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will immediately see a systemic Ross
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a movie showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leaf was treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this leaf and the
first leaf, two leaves that have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: phloem connection to it, will light up
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the rest of the plant will light
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always, the treated leaf behaves
differently than the other leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it was treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stressed, either wounded or
subjected to highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't expect it to be like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all the other tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use this for imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you of different types of
Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use DCF for general Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use peroxy-orange one for hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use it for calcium imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use it for membrane potential
imaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advantage of this is we don't need
to transform the plant with a raciometric
[SPEAKER_00]: or a GFP base, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just fumigate the plants and image
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us to screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We screen hundreds of mutants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really an advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, we always also,
for some things, use GCaMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can image with this imager calcium,
ROGIFPRP1 for hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, we discovered the Ross wave
in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And several years later, the labs of Tina
Romis and Simon Gilroy discovered the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not discover the calcium wave,
a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we wrote a review where we
hypothesized how these things work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, well, Arbo will make Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ross will make calcium going to the
cytosol, activate CpKs, phosphorylates
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbo in this cell, make Ross, change
calcium here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, this is how it will
propagate from cell to cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's a very nice story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What calcium?
[SPEAKER_00]: What channels?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the role of prasmodesmata?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this imager image, imaging
method developed, we could screen over 200
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just showing you briefly examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is CNGC2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to highlight stress,
this is wild-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two independent mutants of
CNGC2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, of course, there is no
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the GLR3.3, 3.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to highlight, you have a
suppressed Ross wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to winding, you have no Ross
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start dissecting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a very long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have several years of work short.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the model where we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that stress will.
