[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I want to tell you a little bit
about is how we're starting to use some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the concepts of evolution and machine
learning and combining those together to
[SPEAKER_06]: really figure out and drive functional
variant discovery and what we hope will
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually become breeding 4.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to first highlight that the work
I'll be telling you about today has been
[SPEAKER_06]: supported by USDA ARS and the National
Science Foundation, but the real thought
[SPEAKER_06]: and efforts behind all of this type of
work is coming from the incredible group
[SPEAKER_06]: of collaborators I've had the pleasure of
collaborating with over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah Miller was helping me count up all
of our collaborators over the years,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've actually collaborated with like
1,200 people now over the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: and working across that global community
has been such a pleasure to learn from
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody and to make progress in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is some of our current
collaborators right now that have helped
[SPEAKER_06]: us shape our thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give you all a little feel for
where we're driving to, and that comes out
[SPEAKER_06]: of our lab's mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our lab's mission, the very first
one element is a very straightforward one.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the genetic basis of natural
diversity?
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple to say, hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, how does it change in DNA
get converted into a change out in the
[SPEAKER_06]: field, something we can see and work with?
[SPEAKER_06]: With models of those, we can then apply
that knowledge to help breed crops for the
[SPEAKER_06]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: and for the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I won't be talking a lot about what
we're doing there, but we try to use our
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding at the top part to help
people across the world build engineering
[SPEAKER_06]: and IT systems to help breed crops to the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, we do all this in the
context of what should we discover and
[SPEAKER_06]: what crops should we breed in order to
reduce the environmental impact of
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've also, in the last couple months,
been giving a number of talks down in
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so frequently I'm asked, what is
breeding?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that actually is a harder question
than I thought initially, because we all
[SPEAKER_06]: around here think we know what breeding
is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the definition I came up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, we view this as the
design and selection of organisms for
[SPEAKER_06]: human purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you start asking, what could we
apply breeding to?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you go through the UN Sustainable
Development Goals, they lay out 17 goals
[SPEAKER_06]: that are critical across the globe for the
next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And where could breeding contribute to
each one of these?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turns out that breeding can
contribute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's the dominant element
or anything, but it can play a role in 10
[SPEAKER_06]: out of the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the reason that I'm interested in
taking quantitative genetics and applying
[SPEAKER_06]: it to breeding is because the leverage of
what we can do and impact the globe is so
[SPEAKER_06]: great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think if each of us can play a
little role in figuring out how we can
[SPEAKER_06]: solve some of these 17 issues,
we can have a real impact across the
[SPEAKER_06]: globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any reason you don't have number
four or four?
[SPEAKER_06]: Quality education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's 11 of them, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the evolution of plant
breeding, though, where have we come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: As was mentioned, I have this background
in archaeology, so I always think about
[SPEAKER_06]: what breeding is in quantitative genetics
from this very long time depth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so 10,000 years ago, I would say we
started out what was called Breeding 1.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were using phenotypic selection to
decide what species should be
[SPEAKER_06]: domesticated.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a quarter million plant species
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 5,000 of them have been domesticated
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And people were really testing out species
level diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And applying selection to some of those
species to really drive them into new and
[SPEAKER_06]: different directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting a little over 100 years ago,
I think the key element was we started
[SPEAKER_06]: having controlled trials, where we
controlled the genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of that came our understanding of
quantitative genetics, experimental
[SPEAKER_06]: design, were really the key elements in
allowing us to make progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those statistics rises out of our
knowledge of plant breeding and our desire
[SPEAKER_06]: to do plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, equipment and tools like
harvesters really help drive our ability
[SPEAKER_06]: to provide and produce selection
effectively.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then a little over almost 20 years ago
now, genomic selection arises,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we're essentially using anonymous
markers across the genome to really drive
[SPEAKER_06]: selection and produce crops faster and
better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for our most sophisticated breeding
programs across the globe and major
[SPEAKER_06]: companies, genomic selection is now the
norm.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's being applied in all of our major
crops and each of those companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think one of the challenges we have
across the nation and across the globe is
[SPEAKER_06]: to make sure genomic selection,
breeding 3.0, gets applied to those 5,000
[SPEAKER_06]: other species that have been domesticated
or to all the environments and all of the
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding efforts across the rest of the
globe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So although I'll be talking most about
breeding 4.0 today, we also do spend a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of time and I think our whole community
should spend a lot of time making sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that breeding 3.0 gets applied everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So finally, breeding 4.0 is really about
designing genomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in order to do this, you have to
identify the causative nucleotides that
[SPEAKER_06]: are underlying quantitative and complex
trait variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can imagine using editing
technology and our understanding of
[SPEAKER_06]: physiology and molecular biology to really
drive things forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll talk about how we're doing some
efforts to help us identify those
[SPEAKER_06]: causative nucleotides.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I think about where variation
comes from, I think the first place to
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of think about it is every
generation, 90 new mutations occur.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the case of maize, and some of
those are adaptive, some of those are
[SPEAKER_06]: deleterious, and the most of them are
neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: And fundamentally, the question that our
group is trying to ask is of those 90
[SPEAKER_06]: mutations that arise every generation,
and they of course are passed on
[SPEAKER_06]: generation after generation for thousands,
even millions of years, which fall into
[SPEAKER_06]: each of these different categories.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're trying to ask and
trying to figure that out as easily and
[SPEAKER_06]: fast as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And why I care about speed and cost is
because there's a lot of genetic variation
[SPEAKER_06]: out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a small sample of maize lines,
they capture about 80 million different
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic variants across the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we think there's on the order of a few
hundred thousand functional variants that
[SPEAKER_06]: are really contributing to most of the
phenotypic variation out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is, how do we go from the top
of that funnel to the bottom of that
[SPEAKER_06]: funnel as cheaply and inexpensively as
possible?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it really is a question of
efficiency to move from the top to the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've worked on a lot of the different
methodologies across here, and I'll talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about a couple of them today with special
emphasis on using conservation,
[SPEAKER_06]: expression, and machine learning to get
from the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to start out with highlighting
that evolution has turned out to probably
[SPEAKER_06]: be the most powerful tool we have for
figuring out what are functional variants
[SPEAKER_06]: across the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, this shouldn't come as a
surprise to anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jansky, 50 or 60 years ago, reminded us of
this, that nothing in biology makes sense
[SPEAKER_06]: except in the light of evolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to give you kind of a
quantitative example of how powerful
[SPEAKER_06]: evolution is at identifying things,
let's think about field trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a decade or so ago, we created the
maize name population.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had 5,000 inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And through a lot of work, we created
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grew them out at, for example,
one experiment, eight location,
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of clones of each one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And effectively, we were able to map a
five kernel per plant difference down to
[SPEAKER_06]: the level of an individual gene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that, in many regards, seems like
that's a pretty good mapping accuracy and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how does that compare to evolution?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, well, so the key thing to realize
about evolution is it's really the
[SPEAKER_06]: integration of billions of years of field
trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every individual is competing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's either surviving or not or dying to
the passions gametes on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in a diverse species, for example,
maize, we sample a thousand different
[SPEAKER_06]: maize lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're capturing about three million years
of evolutionary time by having a sample of
[SPEAKER_06]: a thousand lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those thousand excellent lines are the
product of populations that had an
[SPEAKER_06]: effective population size of nearly
100,000 individuals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the key thing is selection can see a
difference of one kernel out of 250
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in comparison to what we were able to
do in a very large field experiment,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's about 1,200 times more sensitive than
what we can do in a large field
experiment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's effectively, we have the time
and evolution to integrate across all
[SPEAKER_06]: those different events.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what's the problem with using
evolution?
[SPEAKER_06]: The big issue is we don't really know what
the conditions were under which selection
[SPEAKER_06]: operated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's the great weakness of using
evolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've also gotten in the last couple
of decades, getting pretty good at
[SPEAKER_06]: identifying what regions of the genome
have been the product of domestication or
[SPEAKER_06]: the targets of domestication.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in those regions, we actually know
those are the regions where the rules of
[SPEAKER_06]: selection have changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about a domestication locus,
what that really is, is a region of the
[SPEAKER_06]: genome where selection is going in a
different direction today under human
[SPEAKER_06]: selection than it was under natural
selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in the case of maize, which is
probably our most highly domesticated crop
[SPEAKER_06]: out there, there's about a thousand
domestication or improvement loci across
[SPEAKER_06]: the genome, which is about 4%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of all the genes out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from one point of view, no,
we can't be sure what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't use evolution as a guide
necessarily to pick out what is the
[SPEAKER_06]: correct direction to take those loci.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what this does suggest is that the
other 96% of the genome, essentially the
[SPEAKER_06]: rules that have played for the last few
million years are probably the same rules
[SPEAKER_06]: and important directions that are
important today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Photosynthesis in maize still operates
pretty much by the same rules as it did a
[SPEAKER_06]: million years ago, five million years ago,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we use that knowledge to try to
figure out deleterious variants,
[SPEAKER_06]: we've used essentially evolutionary
conservation to work down this trail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let me explain how we do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the first thing about in order to
use conservation, we were using it to try
[SPEAKER_06]: to tackle a question about what produces
deleterious mutations and then what
[SPEAKER_06]: produces heterosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And why we care about deleterious
mutations is over a hundred years ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: geneticists figured out that essentially
deleterious mutations are likely the
[SPEAKER_06]: product or what produce heterosis and
hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially we compliment them and we
get it out hybrid vigor out of the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, a whole maize seed industry
has grown out of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think the question of what is the
basis of heterosis is pretty much a solved
[SPEAKER_06]: question.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the last hundred years, the question
that has not been solved is what are the
[SPEAKER_06]: individual nucleotides across the genome
that contribute to heterosis?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the basic process we've understood for
a century, but what are those individual
[SPEAKER_06]: deleterious mutations?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a former postdoc in the group,
Eli Rogers-Melanick tackled this by asking
[SPEAKER_06]: the question, let me take the maize genome
and line it up across a wide range of
[SPEAKER_06]: other species and identify what regions of
the genome are conserved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Across this wide range of species.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he lined up maize for everything all
the way out to rabbitopsis and grapes and
[SPEAKER_06]: so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he found is about 10% of the
genome was alignable and constrained.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd highlight that most of what he's
talking about are the genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The intergenetic regulatory regions do not
align across this range of diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much just genes that align at
this scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was able, base pair by base pair,
able to ask the question how conserved is
[SPEAKER_06]: every base out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you see a genetic polymorphism
at a base that's incredibly conserved
[SPEAKER_06]: across this entire phylogeny, the odds
that are deleterious are substantially
[SPEAKER_06]: increased.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the same type of process is also
now being used by people in human genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: to identify disease loci and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Eli applied that to our question
here in maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a very strong prior of what we
think should happen with deleterious
[SPEAKER_06]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that the key way to get rid of
deleterious mutations is through
[SPEAKER_06]: recombination that breaks things up and
then essentially selection can eliminate
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we expect to see a pattern such
that in low recombination regions of the
[SPEAKER_06]: genome, we have a buildup of deleterious
mutations and in high recombination
[SPEAKER_06]: regions of the genome, we have fewer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what we saw is that in
low recombination, we had a buildup of
[SPEAKER_06]: deleterious mutations and in the high
recombination, we had fewer of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to highlight though that there
are still lots of deleterious mutations in
[SPEAKER_06]: high recombination regions of the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: About 90 mutations are occurring every
generation and they're all across the
[SPEAKER_06]: genome, pretty much evenly across that
genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the genes are in the high
recombination region.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, there's a buildup.
[SPEAKER_06]: The population genetic prediction that we
are able to purge deleterious mutations
[SPEAKER_06]: better in high recombination is true,
but there are still deleterious mutations
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere just because the pressure of
mutation is so strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Eli then lined up a lot of those
deleterious mutations with a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: different aspects of the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first one he wanted to test was
how did this line up with people who had
[SPEAKER_06]: previously mapped heterosis in maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the early 1990s, Charlie Stuber had
identified that the paracentromeric region
[SPEAKER_06]: of chromosome five exhibited the highest
level of heterosis in maize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Eli took his model of deleterious
mutations, took a map from across
[SPEAKER_06]: chromosome five, and that's exactly what
he saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: A buildup of deleterious mutations right
in the paracentromeric region of the
[SPEAKER_06]: genome and a far less buildup across the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The green is the recombination rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you'll see in maize, we have a very
low recombination rate all across that
[SPEAKER_06]: paracentromeric region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's very difficult for the genome
to purge these deleterious mutations in
[SPEAKER_06]: those regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the pattern in our agreement with
heterosis for this analysis made a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I mentioned, the way we were doing
those conservation analysis, we really
[SPEAKER_06]: could only look at essentially genes and
conserve pretty much protein, conserve
[SPEAKER_06]: proteins there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the second question we wanted to
ask is whether or not we were seeing the
[SPEAKER_06]: same type of patterns looking at RNA and
expression patterns.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some other analysis we had done that
suggested about half of phenotypic
[SPEAKER_06]: variation is the product of expression
differences, half of it's from coding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so is the genome able to purge
deleterious mutations better in these
[SPEAKER_06]: expression domain or does it do worse at
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is where Carl Krumling,
a former graduate student, worked on this
[SPEAKER_06]: question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the real element and key from doing
this analysis is we needed to collect
[SPEAKER_06]: enough expression data from enough
different lines that we could determine
[SPEAKER_06]: what was a rare and aberrant expression
pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what he did, is he got robotized
three prime RNA-seq profiling up and
[SPEAKER_06]: running, got it down for about 25 bucks a
sample, and he was then able to profile
[SPEAKER_06]: nearly 2,000 samples for their RNA levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that large data set, we then
essentially had expression measures on
[SPEAKER_06]: tens of millions of different genes and
alleles all across this panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: That effectively allowed us to start
asking questions about what are rare
[SPEAKER_06]: expression patterns.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the hypothesis he wanted to test was
one that Greg Gibson had laid out in human
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics, and essentially the hypothesis
is as following, and the test is as
[SPEAKER_06]: following.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we kind of expect low expression,
if you bin expression patterns out for
[SPEAKER_06]: each gene, if rare alleles and deleterious
alleles are playing an important role,
[SPEAKER_06]: what we expect to see is that essentially
low expression will be the product of lots
[SPEAKER_06]: of rare alleles and high expression will
also be the product of lots of rare
[SPEAKER_06]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, intermediate expression won't have
an enrichment of rare alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is the basic pattern you would
expect if you think that rare alleles and
[SPEAKER_06]: deleterious alleles are driving extremes
in expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what's the alternative hypothesis
to this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the alternative is that common
alleles actually get stacked up in a way
[SPEAKER_06]: such that the extremes are the product of
lots of different common alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so is that likely to be common?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, across the whole genome,
when we see extremes in phenotype like
[SPEAKER_06]: flowering time, it is the product of
dozens of genes with essentially
[SPEAKER_06]: relatively common alleles getting stacked
up in order to produce those extremes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of extreme early flowering is the product
of lots of common alleles being stacked
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Extreme late flowering is the product,
again, of lots of common alleles being
[SPEAKER_06]: stacked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So genome-wide scale, that's the pattern
we actually do see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Common alleles in general are what are
contributing to a lot of our extremes in
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the level of an individual gene,
recombination is, of course, very limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a limited amount of recombination
in each regulatory region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is a type of area where
extremes may be the product actually of a
[SPEAKER_06]: build up of deleterious mutations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in Greg Gibson's model,
what we would expect to see is essentially
[SPEAKER_06]: a U-shaped plot here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were to plot out the average number
of rare alleles on the Y and then on the
[SPEAKER_06]: X, we go from low expression to high
expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: We expect to see a U like this,
if rare alleles are driving things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what Carl saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when he profiled using these different
maze lines, essentially low expression,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we see low expression, we see this
more than doubling in the number of rare
[SPEAKER_06]: alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do also see an increase in high
expression is the product of an increased
[SPEAKER_06]: number of rare alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So both extremes seem to be pushed by rare
alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: The asymmetry between these two suggests
that rare and deleterious alleles,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's easier to knock down expression than
it is to increase expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: So both directions, we see that extreme on
both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so where you really want to be is
somewhere here in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the sweet spot where expression is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Somewhere in the middle, you don't want to
be at either of those two extremes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that basic hypothesis about extremes,
and the optimal organism is an organism
[SPEAKER_06]: that essentially has balanced expression
everywhere, is effectively the dosage
[SPEAKER_06]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Bertzler has been advocating this for
a number of years as the basis of maze
[SPEAKER_06]: heterosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it works well with a model with
deleterious mutations and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, let me explain the model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, if you have balanced
expression at all your genes, your protein
[SPEAKER_06]: complexes, your metabolism, everything
else goes as expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: That produces a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have extremes in expression,
your protein complexes don't form
[SPEAKER_06]: correctly, metabolites, you get built up
with the wrong metabolites at the wrong
[SPEAKER_06]: time points.
[SPEAKER_06]: You essentially are wasting energy all
over the place if you are not in the
[SPEAKER_06]: center everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that produces weak and inefficient
organisms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in order to be optimal,
you should be average everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the key element there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what the basic model in
heterosis works just fine with this type
[SPEAKER_06]: of model that essentially be average
everywhere, and you will be highly
[SPEAKER_06]: vigorous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what Carl did is he came up with a
very simple statistic of just cumulative
[SPEAKER_06]: dysregulation across every gene in the
genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't give any genes greater weight or
a different weight from one another.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that's very naive.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, cumulative dysregulation
does correlate with seed weight or yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also used an approach where he created
a statistic based on the deviations in
[SPEAKER_06]: expression in order to try to predict the
amount of variance explained in seed
[SPEAKER_06]: weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here he was able to find anywhere from
20 to 30% of seed weight is being
[SPEAKER_06]: explained by this dysregulation,
these patterns of dysregulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we think that maybe about half of
phenotypic variation is coming out of
[SPEAKER_06]: processes that involve these dosage
aspects of essentially not having balanced
[SPEAKER_06]: dosage at each gene in the genome is
producing a lot of the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_06]: variation that is out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, now I told you about those two
different approaches that we were using to
[SPEAKER_06]: get from the top to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we really want to get down to
individual nucleotides so that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: start talking about editing and so on,
how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the problem with all these
deleterious mutations is that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very difficult to map rare things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't want to spend a whole bunch
of time taking every rare allele that's
[SPEAKER_06]: out there and increasing its allele
frequency in order to map it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is where machine learning
comes in, where we're effectively learning
[SPEAKER_06]: the rules of how the genome works so we
can spot these rare and deleterious
[SPEAKER_06]: mutations all across the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been starting to think and apply
this all across essentially the central
[SPEAKER_06]: dogma and beyond.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I'll be talking to you about
today is how we're using machine learning
[SPEAKER_06]: to model both chromatin structure and
expression patterns in maize, actually in
[SPEAKER_06]: maize and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so why are we talking about machine
learning?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, obviously, it's a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're hearing about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be photographed, and machine
learning models will identify you
[SPEAKER_06]: incredibly quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You walk underneath a camera, it knows
exactly who you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fact that that can be done and can
be done for us, why shouldn't we apply
[SPEAKER_06]: these incredible tools to understanding
molecular biology too?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the key reason machine learning does
well at work though is it allows us to
[SPEAKER_06]: process massive amounts of data.
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows us really to generalize rules
from one portion of the genome to the
[SPEAKER_06]: rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows us to generalize rules from a
reference genotype to all the other
[SPEAKER_06]: genotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, if the model is robust
enough, it can be used to really determine
[SPEAKER_06]: if a given genetic variant matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think some of the pushback on
machine learning has been historically
[SPEAKER_06]: that people, especially in the basic
science world, is that it's a black box
[SPEAKER_06]: model.
[SPEAKER_06]: And absolutely, you can treat machine
learning entirely as a black box model and
[SPEAKER_06]: not understand the underlying biology that
is underlying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as I'll show you, we've been doing a
lot more work to essentially, once you
[SPEAKER_06]: create the model, try to probe the model
and ask the question, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: What did it learn?
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, can it teach us something about
what was going on there?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to tell you about a series of
models and these were developed by three
[SPEAKER_06]: great post-docs in the group, Katherine
Mejia, Hai Wong, and Jacob Washburn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the models are fairly straightforward
to explain.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we wanted to do was take sequence and
just sequence.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no other annotation on the sequence.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to know what methylation
status is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to know what the chromatin
structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to take sequence and from
that, be able to predict the following.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the chromatin open?
[SPEAKER_06]: What transcription factor binds there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a pseudogene?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the expression level of the
associated gene next to that sequence?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second class of models is,
if I have two homologous sequences,
[SPEAKER_06]: can I differentiate the expression of
allele A versus allele B and figure out
[SPEAKER_06]: which one has the greater level of
expression?
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the five models we've been
exploring the last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, we're using a couple of
different approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is coming from natural language
processing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very similar to when you type something
into Google and it's trying to process
[SPEAKER_06]: your language and figure out what you're
after.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we've done here, Katherine's
worked on these Kamer language-based
[SPEAKER_06]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're breaking a sequence into Kamers and
then, as I'll show you, you're treating it
[SPEAKER_06]: as essentially a bag of words that we're
modeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second class of models are
these convolutional neural nets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, they've been used to
essentially do image processing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're essentially converting sequences
into ordered images.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're using the CNNs to process
them at different scales and then using
[SPEAKER_06]: neural nets to integrate these process
sequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little bit more detail on what the
Kamer bag of word type models are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's take DNA and effectively,
it could be treated as a bag of words,
[SPEAKER_06]: very short sequences or the Kamers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We take those.
[SPEAKER_06]: We count them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can essentially fit them in a
regression model to make a prediction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a bag of words model is no more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The vector-based ones, which rely on the
ordering of the words, is more complicated
[SPEAKER_06]: and more powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But essentially, the bag of words one is
as simple as just counting up Kamers and
[SPEAKER_06]: fitting it to a regression model.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about the convolutional
neural nets, we're essentially taking a
[SPEAKER_06]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each base pair is getting re-encoded.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what you're seeing is essentially
we're making a black and white picture
[SPEAKER_06]: where A's are encoded here, C's are
encoded there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from that, we take convolutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what convolutions are doing is that
they're looking across that image and
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to highlight various features at
certain scales that then can be passed on
[SPEAKER_06]: to the neural nets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those convolutions essentially
probe the regions, summarize that
[SPEAKER_06]: information there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once we have those convolutions
with neural nets, we can relate those
[SPEAKER_06]: convolutions to any trait or attribute.
[SPEAKER_06]: In our case, we want to relate that
sequence to expression levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a little bit more about how we
measure whether or not we've been able to
[SPEAKER_06]: create machine learning models of any good
or any use.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use what are known as the rock curves
or receiver-operating characteristic
[SPEAKER_06]: curves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, these are just ways to
count how well you're doing in comparing
[SPEAKER_06]: your trues and false positive rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, the way we've set them up
for this talk here, our random expectation
[SPEAKER_06]: is along the diagonal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we expect that to essentially produce
an area under the curve or a rock curve of
[SPEAKER_06]: about 0.5.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have a perfect classifier that's
able to completely differentiate two
[SPEAKER_06]: separate classes with no errors,
it'll follow along there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially, its area under the curve
would be 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is one way we measure whether
or not we've been able to create a machine
[SPEAKER_06]: learning model that is of value.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Katherine took this type of model.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was using the ChIP-seq data from the
transcription factor FIA4 to train on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was able to, using that bag of
words model, be able to create a model
[SPEAKER_06]: that had very high levels of accuracy at
0.99 and essentially was almost perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: classifying where each of those
transcription factors were binding all
[SPEAKER_06]: across the genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't just that transcription
factor.
[SPEAKER_06]: She used the ChIP-seq data from not at
one, also very high levels of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had MNA's open chromatin data that she
was able to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it was able to train very good
models there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she also was able to classify
core promoter sequences with high levels
[SPEAKER_06]: of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, and she's been able to now
repeat this for about 100 other
[SPEAKER_06]: transcription factors with other
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_06]: And effectively, we can now create machine
learning models that model where
[SPEAKER_06]: transcription factor is going to bind with
high levels of accuracy and be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially start annotating all sorts of
other genomes with it, especially within
[SPEAKER_06]: maze.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the questions we did want to
ask is how good are these models
[SPEAKER_06]: transferable from maze to say other
species?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Katherine asked that question.
[SPEAKER_06]: She took her core promoter model and so it
was great in maze.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then she took it to sorghum.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: The transferability from maze to sorghum
wasn't as great as we would have hoped
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we know strategies about how we could
make a model that work across both of
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The key element is we would probably train
across both maze and sorghum
[SPEAKER_06]: simultaneously rather than just training
on one species at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the models, for example,
her not at one model for maze,
[SPEAKER_06]: it actually had superb transferability.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the way to rice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that one transferred 65 million years
without a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So each of these models, some have high
levels of transferability, some don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are strategies for figuring out
and improving the transferability across
[SPEAKER_06]: species.
[SPEAKER_06]: These k-mer models are also really,
we talk about the black box aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that was pretty much black box.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can open up the models and ask,
OK, how did the model figure out that this
[SPEAKER_06]: is a core promoter?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so of course, we know the Tata box
should play an important role in defining
[SPEAKER_06]: a core promoter sequence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what she's plotted out here is
essentially the weight of each k-mer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's thousands of k-mers she was
looking at.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are the Tata-like k-mers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the most important ones for defining a
core promoter are listed here.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you see, they line up right next to
where the transcriptional start site is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, this black box model,
the way it learned how transcription
[SPEAKER_06]: starts in Mays was finding the Tata box
and learning essentially the rules that,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, obviously everybody's known
this for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was able to learn effectively the
right rules on how this works.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, we've also, though, found that
training models can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_06]: And machine learning models, they're
incredibly powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can learn and memorize virtually
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is whether or not it's
learning what you want it to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where the last six months or
so, we've been really doing a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: work to make sure we're training on the
attributes of the models that we really
[SPEAKER_06]: care about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turned out that a lot of our
models, especially when we went across
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of different genes, our models were
effectively able to memorize the
[SPEAKER_06]: evolutionary history of how every gene is
related to every other gene, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which isn't, you know, that's an
interesting evolutionary story,
[SPEAKER_06]: but doesn't teach you the rules of how
molecular biology works and exactly how a
[SPEAKER_06]: promoter works.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't want to just memorize evolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've done is we've started to
think through how can we use evolution as
[SPEAKER_06]: our aid, not something we just memorize.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've set up two different ways of
setting up our training versus our
[SPEAKER_06]: testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one, Ai Wang and the group set
up was essentially gene family guided
[SPEAKER_06]: training, where you train on one set of
gene families.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you take half the gene families across
mates and you train on them, but you hide
[SPEAKER_06]: all the other gene families.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you test if your model is doing very
well with a group of gene families the
[SPEAKER_06]: model has never seen before.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are learning things that are
transferable to gene families you've never
[SPEAKER_06]: seen before, then it's likely a good
model.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't just memorized recent evolution
in order to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second way to do it is to
essentially take a couple related species
[SPEAKER_06]: to one another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially compare the orthologs
against one another in order to set up the
[SPEAKER_06]: contrast there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we call the ortholog
contrast training model.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Jacob Washburn has been leading the
effort in those types of analyses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that first one, Ai wanted to ask the
question, can he train a model to identify
[SPEAKER_06]: what are the pseudogenes across the genome
and which are the genes that are highly
[SPEAKER_06]: expressed?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so normally he's taking the promoter
sequence the UTRs, about 1500 base pairs
[SPEAKER_06]: up there, 1500 base pairs from the 3-prime
UTR and beyond the terminator,
[SPEAKER_06]: throwing that into a model, letting the
convolutional neural net then predict
[SPEAKER_06]: expression levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what he did is he took a data set
where we had expression across 66
[SPEAKER_06]: different tissues and took the maximal
expression level and he asked the
[SPEAKER_06]: question, can he differentiate between the
genes that are never expressed versus the
[SPEAKER_06]: genes that are expressed, that's the
combination of these two, or just the
[SPEAKER_06]: really highly expressed genes?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll preempt this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a lot better at differentiating
between this group versus that group than
[SPEAKER_06]: differentiating between here and all of
these.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the model is still quite good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially when you try to
differentiate between off versus high,
[SPEAKER_06]: he has about an 80% accuracy there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you just use either the promoter or
the terminator, terminator sequence,
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you combine the two of them
together, we get a substantial boost.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially signal for whether or not
the gene is on or high is coming from both
[SPEAKER_06]: the 5-prime and 3-prime end of the gene.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can create a pretty good model,
classify each of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second question that we were
interested in is which allele is more
[SPEAKER_06]: highly expressed?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we're taking two homologous
sequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from a person with a quantitative
genetics background, this is really kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of the fundamental question I have of
molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know a given variant,
does it change, does it make something go
[SPEAKER_06]: up, does it make it go down, or does it
have no effect?
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I get down to the right side of
those, then I can throw it into a more
[SPEAKER_06]: complex model of quantitative genetics and
parameterize everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the style of model I really
want to use in order to parameterize the
[SPEAKER_06]: entire genome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way Jacob has gone about this,
is essentially reframing it using these
[SPEAKER_06]: orthologs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mentioned we're essentially
comparing the orthologs in two different
[SPEAKER_06]: species, training on them, and then
testing on a different set there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of just having one sequence and
making a prediction of phenotype,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're taking two sequences and comparing
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we found is that rather than
actually predicting exactly the difference
[SPEAKER_06]: in expression, we're most interested in
really predicting whether or not it went
[SPEAKER_06]: up or went down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will also highlight that we found
out that there's a lot of genes,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially when we have to compare between
species, that very subtle differences in
[SPEAKER_06]: expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not very good at predicting whether
or not a gene went up or down slightly
[SPEAKER_06]: between major sorghum.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we take a look at the top 20% of
the genes that really moved up and down in
[SPEAKER_06]: the expression between maize and sorghum
orthologs, then we have very good
[SPEAKER_06]: prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of this may be our ability to
really tell whether or not something went
[SPEAKER_06]: up or down isn't great if the expression
differences are really slight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Jacob took this model, very similar to
what Hai, or exactly the same way that Hai
[SPEAKER_06]: broke up the sequences here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's essentially taking two genes in
the model and then letting the
[SPEAKER_06]: convolutional neural net pick out which
ortholog is more highly expressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the pattern here was somewhat
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing to highlight is that
the promoter 5'N versus 3'N, it was really
[SPEAKER_06]: the 3'N that was giving us much more
information than the promoter was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we didn't get much improvement by
combining the two of them together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I mentioned, if we only look at the
20% of the genes and really a big
[SPEAKER_06]: expression differences, then we have a
really accurate model.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's real subtle differences between
maize and sorghum.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not able to pick those out
particularly well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there's a big difference,
we can create a classifier that's actually
[SPEAKER_06]: really accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the interesting thing is most of the
signal was coming from the terminator end
[SPEAKER_06]: of the sequences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to plot that out, again, once we've
created these models, we can go through
[SPEAKER_06]: base pair by base pair and ask,
what did the model learn?
[SPEAKER_06]: What base pairs were most important for
making that prediction?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what you're seeing here is
essentially these are called saliency
[SPEAKER_06]: maps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they're doing is they're telling
us what base pair by base pair is
[SPEAKER_06]: providing the most information and high
expression.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turned out when we do that ortholog
contrast model, that the sequences right
[SPEAKER_06]: before the terminator sequence were the
most important for determining the
[SPEAKER_06]: expression levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: While if we look at pseudogenes,
5' UTRs were most important, and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are learning that for each of these
different models, different portions of
[SPEAKER_06]: the gene seem to be most important for
explaining this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what this is suggesting is the model
that I was working on was really asking
[SPEAKER_06]: questions about how different classes of
genes control their regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be an issue that's
substantially regulated by the 5' UTR,
[SPEAKER_06]: the promoter sequence, and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fine tuning of how one gene changes
its expression through evolutionary time
[SPEAKER_06]: seems to be coming more from the 3' UTR
side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether the gene is on or off,
5', whether that exact amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: expression that's left on in the fine
tuning of it, and what makes the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between maize and sorghum,
may well be coming from the 3' UTR side of
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least that's our current hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to end up here, though,
is can we also probe these models and get
[SPEAKER_06]: down to that level where we're really
starting to ask the question, can we edit?
[SPEAKER_06]: And Katherine took one of her models.
[SPEAKER_06]: She lined up her data and her model of not
at one against empirical data that Sarah
[SPEAKER_06]: Hakes group produced a decade ago,
and where they tweaked individual base
[SPEAKER_06]: pairs and then did a competition assay to
ask, do these individual base pairs
[SPEAKER_06]: matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you'll see is that where she
predicts high regulatory probabilities,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what we see, and where she predicts
low in these individual base pair changes,
[SPEAKER_06]: they line up with the competition assays.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we've gotten to a level where
these machine learning models can be true
[SPEAKER_06]: brain, that they have the sensitivity to
ask the question, if one or two bases are
[SPEAKER_06]: changed here, that's likely to produce an
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are the limits of our current
models?
[SPEAKER_06]: So those deleterious models I was telling
you about, they're good at splitting
[SPEAKER_06]: neutral from functional.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say there's 80 million variants out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're at a stage where,
at least for amino acids, I can tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: these are the 2,000 or 3,000 bad amino
acids out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from one point of view, we separated
3,000 away from 80 million, that seems
[SPEAKER_06]: really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not very good at telling you among
those last 3,000, which is the worst one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're not very good at ranking
within those last 3,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also, when we go across this much
diversity, we're missing the regulatory
[SPEAKER_06]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_06]: How Mays is controlling its expression
versus Arabidopsis, things have changed so
[SPEAKER_06]: dramatically that the rule, we can't learn
all the rules from Arabidopsis on how each
[SPEAKER_06]: individual gene is being expressed in
Mays.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we have very diverse
physiology.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are we working to get around that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, initially we only had four species
of the anthropogoniae.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what we're doing now is we've just
got started on a project that's been
[SPEAKER_06]: funded by the National Science Foundation
with my colleagues, Toby Kellogg,
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt Hufford, Jeff Ross-Avara,
Adam Siepland, Chi Sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're gonna focus on one clade.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so why do we care about focusing on a
clade?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mentioned initially that Mays,
we've learned a lot from Mays,
[SPEAKER_06]: but with 1,000 genomes worth of
sequencing, we only capture about 3
[SPEAKER_06]: million years of evolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were to apply that same 1,000
genomes worth of information across this
[SPEAKER_06]: entire clade from, say, 900 different
anthropogoniae, we would capture 1.5
[SPEAKER_06]: billion years of evolutionary time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've dramatically increased the total
amount of time by 300 fold that we're now
[SPEAKER_06]: sampling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was telling you how sensitive
evolution is at detecting fitness
[SPEAKER_06]: differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we've turbocharged it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have 300 times more information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the key thing is within this clade,
they all share NADP C4 photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all roughly in the big scheme of
things, the same physiology and similar
[SPEAKER_06]: developmental patterns.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're not trying to make models that
work all the way out to our rabbit ops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working with a group of grasses that
are untrained systematists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of them all look very similar to one
another.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have adapted all over the planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one way to view this is this is really
saturation evolutionary analysis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every ancestral base pair here has
actually been mutated 50 times somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: coming out here into those 900 different
species.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every base pair has been whacked by
mutations all over the place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can actually start measuring
constraint directly.
[SPEAKER_06]: These species, although they
developmentally look very similar,
[SPEAKER_06]: have actually adapted to an incredible
range of also environmental adaptations
[SPEAKER_06]: from frost to very hot temperatures,
drought environments to essentially in
[SPEAKER_06]: swamps.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so from across this entire species,
we can learn how these species have
[SPEAKER_06]: adapted to some of those diverse
environmental adaptations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're working to essentially
sample, sequence, analyze all 900 of those
[SPEAKER_06]: species genomes in the next several years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really see that evolution and
machine learning, we will be bringing
[SPEAKER_06]: those together where we see that evolution
provides us this near infinite level of
[SPEAKER_06]: mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It provides us an ability to see fitness
effects that are a thousand fold more
[SPEAKER_06]: powerful than field experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have provided this incredible
range of environmental histories.
[SPEAKER_06]: While machine learning is allowing us to
scale to genome sizes, learning can be
[SPEAKER_06]: generalized, and we can throw virtually
anything into a machine learning model.
[SPEAKER_06]: So heterogeneous inputs can go in,
and we can still make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the tools we have here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where we're working a lot now
is to figure out what are the most
[SPEAKER_06]: intelligent ways to combine all these
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can identify prioritize those
individual snips, so that we can go from a
[SPEAKER_06]: place where we have models of how each of
the various steps in that central dogma
[SPEAKER_06]: work, although we have to physiology,
we can then test those hypotheses based on
[SPEAKER_06]: how they work in standing variation.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they work well, we go ahead and we
start editing and selecting away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to end here that a lot of folks
in my group have contributed to these
[SPEAKER_06]: ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I highlighted many of the people,
the postdocs and students who produced a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of exact data sets I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my group and all those great
collaborations and data sets we've been a
[SPEAKER_06]: product of are really three people in the
group really helped bring everything
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's Cinta Verme, Peter Bradbury,
and Sarah Miller.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd be happy to take some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each sample that you're putting into
these models seems like a moving target,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Developmentally speaking, tissue cells,
how do you control for that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, so the question is,
how do you change through different
[SPEAKER_06]: developmental time points and everything?
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, the way we've been
treating it right now, everything is at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same developmental stage, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the models we've created are for a
developmental stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in maize and sorghum, we can still
grow those two plants side by side,
[SPEAKER_06]: one another.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can collect expression data side by
side for one another and make sense of
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the good things though about
expression, the data sets are so rich,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can stage one another against so many
orthologs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is possible to stage models against
one another.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just from the empirical data,
you can frequently figure out where you
[SPEAKER_06]: are in development, where you are in
various stages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think long term though, the models
absolutely need to be generalized through
[SPEAKER_06]: the dynamic time changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not something we're interested
in, we have not worked on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that become a problem when you're
going to other species that may not
[SPEAKER_05]: develop as sorghum or maize does?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there'll be situations where the
models will not work as well for certain
[SPEAKER_06]: developmental aspects.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think a lot of them, a lot of the
development is, it is timing here,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're stretched out or extended a little
bit more and that produces the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_06]: effect that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the basic patterns in
regulation are pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the fact that a lot of our maize
and sorghum models, the fact that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: even train a model on expression that's
between maize and sorghum really well,
[SPEAKER_06]: says the rules are pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, so I mean, the V4 that you
described has a lot of purging rare
[SPEAKER_00]: deleterious of mules, but not really,
like it doesn't really involve mining for
[SPEAKER_00]: and spreading and fixing rare beneficial
mules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering specifically about
biotic stress, where a rare beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: mule is much, much more valuable than a
gene that everyone already has,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's probably already worthless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the question is about rare
advantageous for adaptive alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so first off, there's a certain
level where we're never going to be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to capture every adaptive mutation that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most adaptive mutations, if they
really truly are adaptive for that
[SPEAKER_06]: population, they will be common there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a biotic stress,
like a new one, or a gene which formerly
[SPEAKER_00]: worked really great against soybeans,
it's not a toad, a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's now worthless because of the change
in the target.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Situations where you have very rapidly
changing, a Red Queen situation like
[SPEAKER_06]: biotic stress, I think different
approaches really need to be used to
[SPEAKER_06]: figure out what are the useful alleles
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Queen, I would say, is not,
yeah, this is not the approach to go find
[SPEAKER_06]: those alleles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are other approaches that
would be far more advantageous for
[SPEAKER_06]: figuring out disease low-sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would say most of the abiotic
stresses, they are, yes, they may
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuate from year to year, but over a
deep time, all the organisms have seen
[SPEAKER_06]: drought.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've seen flooding and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of those alleles are maintained
at reasonable frequencies and over a wide
[SPEAKER_06]: enough panel, you'll be able to find that
that allele is adaptive and it's common
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may be rare in your little panel,
but if it really is adaptive and you are
[SPEAKER_06]: sampling as much diversity to say the
entire anthropogony, it'll be common in a
[SPEAKER_06]: number of places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Russ.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the transcription factors,
transcription factor binding sites,
[SPEAKER_04]: so since the AUC is so high, 0.99,
there must be some features that are
[SPEAKER_04]: really indicative of that particular
binding site.
[SPEAKER_04]: So between the transcription factor
binding sites that showed a high AUC
[SPEAKER_04]: versus those that did not, are there any
trends or common features?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Catherine is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that, I know we're, is Catherine
here?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that were not very high,
anybody else in the lab wants to correct
[SPEAKER_06]: me, feel free.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that were not high, generally the
ChIP-seq experiments were pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the biggest thing we've seen for
the improvement of the quality of the
[SPEAKER_06]: models is replication of numerous ChIP-seq
experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they are replicated and you line
up the experiments over and over again,
[SPEAKER_06]: those sites can be modeled really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the neat thing also Catherine has done
is she's been able to take those models
[SPEAKER_06]: and compare, for these 100 transcription
factors, compare what the model looks like
[SPEAKER_06]: against each one, for each transcription
factor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the families of transcription factors
fall out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So suggesting that essentially it really
is learning the basic processes by which
[SPEAKER_06]: these TFs are binding.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as far as your presentation,
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at, do you think there's
a change across the time due to mutations
[SPEAKER_02]: and other factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: So does it mean the products that we have
today, like if they are resistant for
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases or are the same, will also have a
change for tomorrow either to the worse or
[SPEAKER_02]: the better?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is there a way of stopping or
minimizing these changes across time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're looking for resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the question of whether or not
can we reduce total mutation rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Higher eukaryotes, there is actually
probably a fairly strong selection to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: down that mutation rate as low as it
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably about what at least this
type of polymerase biology can pull off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know that knocking down,
I mean, selection has tried to do that
[SPEAKER_06]: really hard to make incredibly high
fidelity polymerases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm not convinced that that's an
easy target to do is to reduce the total
[SPEAKER_06]: mutation rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can screen DNA sequencing that was so
cheap, you can essentially screen through
[SPEAKER_06]: things and just throw out any novel
mutation that looks kind of bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're working in a large breeding
company, that is not a crazy idea that
[SPEAKER_06]: that's how you purge things out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this kind of goes back to the same
type of question, that evolution is not
[SPEAKER_06]: always a great guide for picking out these
abiotic red queen type disease issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean machine learning
couldn't be incredibly powerful for
[SPEAKER_06]: predicting what ligands are going to come
together and if you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's all sorts of black box
types of things that you could have
[SPEAKER_06]: machine learning predicting how to deal
with disease resistance, but it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: using exactly the same evolution.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may use evolutionary time to generate
the diversity, but it becomes a different
[SPEAKER_06]: question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why Pioneer hired Eli Rogers
Mellon.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether or not we could fix heterosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, I think the first question is
whether or not we'll be allowed to edit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are those issues and I think
that's how society will allow that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there are going to be,
I mean, you'll always be able to make a
[SPEAKER_06]: hybrid that is better than whatever inbred
you just made.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just because of distributions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a few loci across the
genome, I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: That are truly over dominant rather than
being the product of a dosage pattern or
[SPEAKER_06]: dominance type one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think hybrids will always be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether or not though it looks right now,
a maize hybrid has two times the yield of
[SPEAKER_06]: its inbreds or three times its yields of
its inbred, whether or not it will close
[SPEAKER_06]: down to only 50% better or 30% better and
how quickly we can get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how quickly we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's the role of hybrids in
evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I personally like your concept
of the ethereal mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a very central meaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't know the way to break it is
by our combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, there are hybrids in natural
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if there are so much better,
I mean, I can see over billions of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: genome rearranging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't actually have genes in the
pericentromeric regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they more accessible to the
combination?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we see it in the muter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's possible to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is where, and maybe I
didn't emphasize this enough, that
[SPEAKER_06]: pericentromeric increase, we see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's absolutely there of these
deleterious mutations.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are deleterious mutations
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're enriched in the
pericentromeric regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But most of the genes are still out at the
arms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're still having lots of
deleterious mutations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing that Eli figured out was
there are processes, bias gene conversion
[SPEAKER_06]: is actually maintaining deleterious
mutations at high recombination regions of
[SPEAKER_06]: the genome at fairly moderate frequencies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are other processes that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So deleterious mutations are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just happen to be enriched in the
pericentromeric region.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would still, I mean, we see
heterosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's enriched.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's enriched in that chromosome 5.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we see the evidence of heterosis
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not, yeah, one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, if you think that
hybrids would have higher fitness in a
[SPEAKER_03]: natural situation, then you wouldn't
expect to see an enrichment of deleterious
[SPEAKER_03]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's still less philosophical.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think because of deleterious
mutation, for example, most polyploidy,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that extant is the product of
escaping from deleterious mutations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a way to temporarily get away
from deleterious mutation buildup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, over deep time, this is where you
look at the total number of polyploidy
[SPEAKER_06]: that have been successful in evolutionary
time implants.
[SPEAKER_06]: In deep evolution, it's 50 different
events.
[SPEAKER_06]: But any one time, there's tens of
thousands of polyploidy that are evolving
[SPEAKER_06]: and allows you to short-term escape from
deleterious mutations for a few thousand
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those polyploids, I'm not sure if I
would agree, because the effect of
[SPEAKER_03]: polyploidy is going down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not immediate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediately, they're really bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some people would argue against
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, we can talk later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.
