[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an extension associate with the
Cornell Waste Management Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're part of the Soil and Crop Sciences
section in the School of Integrative Plant
[SPEAKER_02]: Sciences here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed the name on us just to
confuse things and force us to update all
[SPEAKER_02]: our materials eventually, many of which
still have the old name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so I do have some slides, but I want
to keep it really informal and keep this
[SPEAKER_02]: intro part really brief so that we have
some time to talk about concerns and ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: and interests from all of your
perspectives because it's really useful
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to hear from some people that I
haven't necessarily crossed paths with
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And broadly, I began my work with Cornell
about eight years ago to address concerns
[SPEAKER_02]: about soil quality and soil contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of that work has been through a
collaborative effort called Healthy Soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: Healthy Communities, which I'll tell you a
bit more about in just a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, as I said, I'd like to give
you a brief overview of our research and
[SPEAKER_02]: extension outreach resources and programs,
but then more importantly spend some time
[SPEAKER_02]: brainstorming a little bit how we might be
able to all work together to address some
[SPEAKER_02]: needs and concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always helpful to hear a new
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Healthy Soils, Healthy Communities has
been funded for a number of years by the
[SPEAKER_02]: National Institutes of Health and the
National Institute of Environmental Health
[SPEAKER_02]: Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: That funding has actually currently run
out, but it's supported this program for a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This partnership was led by Cornell
together with the State Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Health and a number of partners in New
York City, including New York City Parks
[SPEAKER_02]: and Rec's Green Thumb Program,
as well as other partners in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: City, Buffalo and elsewhere across the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And broadly, the goal of this research was
to help understand more about levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination in urban gardens and farms,
and then what that might mean for possible
[SPEAKER_02]: exposures and health risks, and to inform
our understanding of how we can recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable and feasible healthy gardening
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to just point out to
people that there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to focus on feasible strategies
that they can implement in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens or yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this Healthy Soils program was focused
on urban community gardens more
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of what we've learned carries
over to rural areas, residential
[SPEAKER_02]: properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't just get questions from urban
gardeners, even though that was the focus
[SPEAKER_02]: of this part of the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you all know, gardening and farming
have many, many benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything from source of
healthy food to physical and mental health
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits, community building, all of these
really great things that I don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into this crowd because you're all
well aware of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to keep those benefits in mind,
but the reality is that there are also
[SPEAKER_02]: risks at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years of human activity have sometimes
left contaminants in soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: In many areas, we don't have enough
information about levels of contamination
[SPEAKER_02]: and what might be going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes gardening and farming
activities and any other activities,
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational activities, anything that
could increase contact with the soil may
[SPEAKER_02]: also bring people in contact with
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of jokingly call this guy
exposure man just to give you an idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: the possible ways that people can come in
contact with contaminants in their
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be eating products that are grown
in soils, which is vegetables or chicken
[SPEAKER_02]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may be accidentally breathing in or
swallowing soil as they're working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their skin may be touching soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then little kids of course also may be
eating soil, may be playing in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to think about all these
pathways where people contact soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This work and my job here and our
extension focus have really come out of
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of questions that we get from
gardeners and homeowners and county
[SPEAKER_02]: educators and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should people test their soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the site history matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the location matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, how should they collect soil
samples?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really no single strategy to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can help people think through the
decision making at the early end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day when they're just thinking about
sampling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where should they send the samples?
[SPEAKER_02]: Different labs offer different services
and different educational materials,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should the results mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't help to have numbers unless
that can help us turn that into some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of action and help the people that we work
with take some type of meaningful,
[SPEAKER_02]: feasible action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what should gardeners do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What should homeowners do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the focus of how can our
research efforts inform our understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: of best practices and strategies that
people can do to reduce their contact with
[SPEAKER_02]: soil contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the Healthy Soils Project,
basically we've sampled contaminants in
[SPEAKER_02]: our environment in a number of different
ways, everywhere from the soils of gardens
[SPEAKER_02]: and farms to the vegetables that grew in
those soils to the chicken eggs that were
[SPEAKER_02]: raised in some of these urban farms and
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helps us understand more about
the contact that people have with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can then inform these best practices
that we've been referring to, which can
[SPEAKER_02]: then inform our future research and help
us figure out places where we might need
[SPEAKER_02]: more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not going to get into all of the
science or all the details here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but broadly our 10 best practices for
healthy gardening resource is a half sheet
[SPEAKER_02]: handout that gives an overview of kind of
the take home points of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use clean soil and compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use raised beds or grow in a clean medium
whenever possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avoid treated wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain types of wood can contain
contaminants that are a health risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover or mulch your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maintain soil nutrients and pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a barrier under play areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep an eye on children to be sure they're
not just ingesting handfuls of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basic hygiene practices like leaving your
soil in the garden, washing your hands,
[SPEAKER_02]: washing and peeling produce can make a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we have a variety of resources
that get into the details of all of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm happy to answer more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to give you a taste of how all
this works, here's an example of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: our research findings that have informed
our understanding of best practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, from our research in New
York City community gardens, through our
[SPEAKER_02]: data we have seen that average lead levels
are lower in gardens that have more raised
[SPEAKER_02]: beds as opposed to growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that shows us that these
recommendations are on target and that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are actually seeing results from people
growing in raised beds with clean material
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than growing in ground soil that in
many cases can be contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding compost helps lower lead levels and
helps to bind lead in the soil to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: less available to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work a lot with compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Added benefit to that is of course that
compost is great for gardening in general
[SPEAKER_02]: and there are many other benefits aside
from just the considerations for
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommend that gardeners keep their
soils near neutral for most crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And behind that recommendation is what
we've seen that at lower pH, lead is in a
[SPEAKER_02]: more available form in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that as the pH is lower,
it's more likely that lead can be taken up
[SPEAKER_02]: into plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the good news is that for lead,
it's actually physical contamination by
[SPEAKER_02]: soil particles not up to take through the
roots that likely accounts for most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: lead in vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good news that plants are good at
keeping lead out of their tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that there are other things
we can do to keep dust and soil particles
[SPEAKER_02]: off of plants like mulching and washing
them thoroughly and designing our gardens
[SPEAKER_02]: so that we have fewer areas of bare soil
blowing around on our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And crop type matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the results of all the vegetable
testing we did in New York City and
[SPEAKER_02]: Buffalo gardens, we see lower levels of
lead and other contaminants overall in
[SPEAKER_02]: fruiting crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fruits and vegetable fruits, roots and
leafy greens can be more affected by
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination because the roots are
growing directly in the soil and the leafy
[SPEAKER_02]: greens can be more affected by those soil
particles and can be difficult to wash off
[SPEAKER_02]: of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a lot of fruiting crops,
you can wash them more easily and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant has even more natural barriers to
keep the contaminants out of the part that
[SPEAKER_02]: we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that can be another useful tool if
people are dealing with a challenging
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the hash sheet handout that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is available on our website for
download in English and Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working on developing other
resources that are kind of short and sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our other fact sheets are a little bit
longer and more involved and tend to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: good resource for people that are looking
for more detailed science and more
[SPEAKER_02]: detailed information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those are a series of fact
sheets that guide people through thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about sources and impacts of contaminants
in soils, guide to soil testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: interpreting results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best practices for healthy gardens is kind
of the longer version of the short hash
[SPEAKER_02]: sheet that I just showed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: As is our newest resource which is called
metals and urban garden soils and that
[SPEAKER_02]: gives the same healthy gardening tips but
also gives detailed information for the
[SPEAKER_02]: elements most, the metals most commonly of
concern for human health and plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lead as well as about eight or so
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And including guidance values that can
help people understand what their test
[SPEAKER_02]: results mean and what they should compare
them to to make informed decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just some other resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you may be familiar with the New
York State's Healthy Gardening brochure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this pictured here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're happy to send them to folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have lots of copies printed so
there's a way to order them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can order them through the DOH website
if you're ever looking for those to hand
[SPEAKER_02]: out to people that can use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And EPA has some great resources as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the eight or so years that
we've been working on this project we've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen more and more information becoming
available from federal agencies and other
[SPEAKER_02]: research programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to hear more about what types of
questions you get in your counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you feel like you have the
information and resources that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are specific things that you'd
like to see from us we would love to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned we've heard that there's a
need for more shorter resources,
[SPEAKER_02]: more multimedia things that are a little
more digestible than fact sheets for
[SPEAKER_02]: certain audiences which is definitely a
fair point and something we're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it would really be great if
anyone has ideas for making connections
[SPEAKER_02]: across New York State to share information
and successes and make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing whatever resources people have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get quite a few questions rather about
pressure treated lumber and seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a, I don't know if this is unique
here but we've had a fair bit of pushback
[SPEAKER_01]: recently about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well there's no proof that the new
compounds are toxic and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a Cornell publication that
gives some guidance in writing there that
[SPEAKER_01]: we could show to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well since it's not proven safe we suggest
that you, you know, not use it or
[SPEAKER_01]: something until we get better,
you know, some studies come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not aware of a specific resource that
gets into the chemicals that are currently
[SPEAKER_02]: in pressure treated lumber.
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of you know the concern for many
years was the CCA treated lumber that had
[SPEAKER_02]: copper, chromium, and arsenic in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of which are not a great idea from the
human health perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That our position with the current treated
lumber is that we don't have any research
[SPEAKER_02]: showing that it's harmful but we also
don't have any research showing that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to err on the side of caution would be
to use a non-treated, an untreated
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So number three is avoid treated wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't get into the details of why
and part of that is that this sheet is
[SPEAKER_02]: very basic but we don't specifically name
the chemicals in the new treated wood or
[SPEAKER_02]: get into why they're a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some of our longer documents we've
explained what the problem was with CCA
[SPEAKER_02]: treated wood but the more years we get out
from that being in circulation that's
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming a little less relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree that maybe it's time to update
one of our longer resources to comment
[SPEAKER_02]: more specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean would it still be useful even
if it just said something like we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have evidence that it's safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that just a cop out?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that that's sort of the balance
is with a lot of these issues we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily have answers or complete
research-based information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of putting things in writing
it's a little bit of a balance of when do
[SPEAKER_02]: we feel confident enough that we can share
something without adding to the confusion
[SPEAKER_02]: versus areas that just truly need more
research and therefore we're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting until we see some results to
fine-tune some of our recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one about treated wood,
I mean that question of whether chemicals
[SPEAKER_02]: and current treated wood are toxic is not
something that our research group will be
[SPEAKER_02]: prepared to handle anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be that we just do need some
language to give people more specific
[SPEAKER_02]: advice now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question related to pressure
treated is if we're not going to use
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure treated are there other species
we might recommend that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we've had good luck with locusts.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's a available where your gardeners
are, where you are, that's not always an
[SPEAKER_02]: option for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean untreated lumber can work though it
isn't going to last quite as well as other
[SPEAKER_02]: options.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know something like cedar could work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could possibly pick apart the
sustainability of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again I know here in Ithaca locally
sourced locust has been a great
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little tricky to work with
initially because it is so hard but once
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got the beds in place they've been
holding up really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one thing that we would like to
do more of as well is to work with county
[SPEAKER_02]: educators and others to have resource
lists for particular locations for things
[SPEAKER_02]: like bed building supplies and soil and
compost and all of these things that seem
[SPEAKER_02]: so basic from the short version of our
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how do you clean soil and compost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's great as long as you have a
source that is reliable and may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: contributing to contamination concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes use raised beds is a very
oversimplified recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to know what type of wood,
how high they should be, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically what should they be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of that is really going to be
situation dependent and that there should
[SPEAKER_02]: be room for flexibility based on the needs
of a particular site.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I agree that it would that more
tutorials, more work shops would be
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hearing from people that they
would like more details for all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really hard to come up with
specific guidance on soil testing but I
[SPEAKER_04]: would love to see more kinds of tools like
a flow chart related to helping decision
[SPEAKER_04]: making based on site history, intended
use, and budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anything like that exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: It exists in our heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually something we've thought a
lot about.
[SPEAKER_02]: A flow chart or almost like a decision
tree format that's easier to navigate than
[SPEAKER_02]: a fact sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes we agree with you that that would
be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't made it happen yet but that is
definitely something that's on our radar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any specific ideas for
components that would go into that and
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'd like to see please feel free to
pass them along because that is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are kind of on the back burner at
the moment but I would love to see that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get questions regarding salt water
overwash from Hurricane Sandy.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were home heating oil spills from
flooding so contamination due the weather
[SPEAKER_04]: related episodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get questions on whether it's safe
to plant vegetables on their property now
[SPEAKER_04]: three years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we had gotten a lot of questions
following Hurricane Sandy as you might
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine because we work closely with a
number of gardeners and organizations in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the specific resources in
front of me but we do actually have some
[SPEAKER_02]: information written up that I would be
happy to share if that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gist of it basically was that given
time the soil should be able to recover
[SPEAKER_02]: from the salts and the thing to be
concerned about would be if there were
[SPEAKER_02]: noticeable signs of something like an oil
spill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know an oily residue in the soil or
a chemical smell either petroleum smell or
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence that some sort of other chemical
had made its way into the garden as a
[SPEAKER_02]: result of the flooding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the specifics of what was
there I could consult with my team to see
[SPEAKER_02]: about what we're looking at three years
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of just the basic oh we've had
we've had a lot of salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very likely that systems are in good
shape by now if there was a more specific
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminant spill that could possibly be
something that could be addressed through
[SPEAKER_02]: testing and bringing in clean materials
and figuring out exactly what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: if that hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd be happy to talk further and share
what we had shared with gardeners at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting questions about soil pesticide
contamination and residue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any information you have related to
helping ease people's concerns about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure so pesticides is a really broad
category of potential issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that's been on our radar a lot
is the past use of lead arsenate on former
[SPEAKER_02]: orchard lands especially and also some
different types of growing areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah we've actually done a lot of
research here at the Dillman Hill Student
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm on campus which was an orchard site
in the past and was heavily impacted by
[SPEAKER_02]: lead arsenate contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So highly elevated levels of both lead and
arsenate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which bad news for Student Farm but it's
actually turned into a really great
[SPEAKER_02]: research opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the staff and students at the farm
have worked with us and others over a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of years now to be sure that
they're growing food in areas that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: impacted by the contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been able to learn a lot for our
own projects by taking advantage of this
[SPEAKER_02]: site that was impacted by this historical
contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one specific example of one type
of past pesticide use that has had lasting
[SPEAKER_02]: repercussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of a big one because
there's a lot of former orchard land
[SPEAKER_02]: that's now being used for gardening and
other purposes and farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of think about identifying
contaminant problems as detective work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paul thinking about specifically what
may have happened on a site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we know exactly hey this
gardener or this landscaper came in and
[SPEAKER_02]: applied this particular product.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case you can look up the
material safety data sheets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can possibly test for a particular
chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other cases it's more of a vague
understanding that maybe something was
[SPEAKER_02]: used in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general we recommend testing for metals
as a starting point if there are possible
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns about contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there were lead arsenate used that
would show up in the form of lead and
[SPEAKER_02]: arsenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing for organic pesticides for example
gets very expensive very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't generally recommend that
people test for other specific
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants beyond metals unless they
really have cause to think that it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue with their site and some specific
question that they think the testing can
[SPEAKER_02]: help with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise what might be a better
alternative is to put the money that they
[SPEAKER_02]: would have spent on testing into getting
clean materials and possibly just covering
[SPEAKER_02]: up the known or suspected problem at a
given site.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not always possible but it's also
not always possible for someone to spend
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds or thousands of dollars on soil
testing particularly in a residential
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a trade-off of considering
what we know about the site, what's likely
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a problem, what resources are
available including money and then
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out the balance of okay should we
focus on testing to learn more which is
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal or do we just put that money into
implementing best practices that can
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce contact with the contaminants even
if they may be buried under kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: working surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really where this 10 best
practices for healthy gardening emerged
[SPEAKER_04]: out of that thought of like how can we
make best use of our resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely and in a cost-effective way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Site remediation meaning actually removing
contaminated soil is very rarely an option
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of the gardeners that we work
with because if you think about it you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got to have the money to bring in the
equipment to get the soil out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's then got to go to a landfill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in New York City logistics of
moving things and transport can be really
[SPEAKER_02]: daunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what often makes more sense is to
instead cover up the contamination and
[SPEAKER_02]: just start fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're growing food that often means
raised beds or putting some type of
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier down and then bringing in clean
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: A framed bed can work, a mound of clean
soil over a surface that's blocking off
[SPEAKER_02]: the contaminated material can also work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's difficult to give very specific
recommendations because as I said before a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sites can benefit from flexibility
of finding what works for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are kind of the basic principles
that we want people to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the pH is very different than the
normal surrounding soil should be or are
[SPEAKER_03]: there any hints that there might be heavy
metal contamination?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any red flag testing that you can do
that's less expensive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really is the tricky part.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example we can see plants thriving in
soils that are very high in lead because
[SPEAKER_02]: lead is not toxic to plants the way it is
to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain metals are phytotoxic but those
don't tend to be the same ones that are a
[SPEAKER_02]: concern for human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we find most helpful is thinking
about the most common sources of
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for lead, lead paint is really a big
one in both urban and rural areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a garden or soil of any kind is
adjacent to an older painted structure
[SPEAKER_02]: that would have had lead paint at some
time in the past it's very likely that
[SPEAKER_02]: there may be elevated levels of lead
closest to that structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to see the highest levels right by
the building and then it declines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It increases from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there was an old outbuilding on
the site, an old garage or an old shed or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that would have been painted and
that building may get taken down and the
[SPEAKER_02]: current owner may not even remember that
that had been there or know that it had
[SPEAKER_02]: been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we were to test the whole site we
may see kind of this legacy of that past
[SPEAKER_04]: lead paint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lead from leaded gasoline was also a big
impact on lead levels so places closer to
[SPEAKER_02]: busier roadways can be impacted by lead
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the lead arsenate from
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these possible sources are a little
different for each of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our fact sheets you can read more about
specific contaminants and where they may
[SPEAKER_02]: have come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for lead you can't see it or smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For organic contaminants if you smell
something that doesn't seem quite right,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you see an oily residue that might be
evidence that something was going on,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you know that burning had happened at a
site, an old burn barrel could give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: clue that that might be an area to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than these types of clues and
trying to parse out the site history,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately there generally aren't easy
ways to look at the soil or look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and know that there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you see a pool of oil or smell
something but that's kind of an extreme
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking to hear from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more we hear from people the more we
can make a strong case that we should
[SPEAKER_02]: exist and that our program should be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're happy to hear inquiries directly
from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please pass along questions from people
you work with in your counties that we may
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to help answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please make use of us so that we can
continue to exist and be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.

Thank you.
