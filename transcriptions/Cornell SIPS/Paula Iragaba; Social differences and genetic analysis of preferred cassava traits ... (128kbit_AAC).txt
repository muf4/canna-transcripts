[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Paula Ilagawa and I'm happy to
share with you my research on cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: trait preferences of smaller farmers in
Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this picture, the farmer was telling me
that he was impressed by the yield of this
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava is an important source of food and
it is estimated that over 500 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people eat cassava on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Uganda, where I come from, cassava is
our second most important staple food
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the parts of the cassava plant are
used in one way or another, but for food
[SPEAKER_00]: we normally use the cassava roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the recent past, a lot of effort has
been focused on improving cassava for
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there has been less emphasis put
on researching on improving quality
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences, most especially those of
women who do a lot of work regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava production and processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, this consequently limits the
adoption and usage of improved cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, there is need to link farmers'
knowledge to that of the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: My work will be trying to address,
to contribute towards narrowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge gap in three different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one will be to identify the
trait preferences of smaller farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then second, it will be to optimize the
phenotyping protocols for the identified
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and do studies to understand the
genetic basis of the preferred traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first study was aimed at identifying
the application of cassava trait
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences of smaller farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We conducted this study in four districts
in Uganda and we had a number of factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that we considered to select the four
districts which included, were interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in areas with high cassava production,
high diversity of land races and low
[SPEAKER_00]: disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within each district, we randomly
selected 128 farmers stratified by age and
[SPEAKER_00]: sex to participate in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we collected the data by holding focus
group discussions with small groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and administering some structured
interviews to individual farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, we had, we held started two
focus group discussions and administered
[SPEAKER_00]: 128 farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also collected cassava leaf samples
from all the farmers' fields in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cassava varieties that they were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will help us to understand the
genetic diversity of the farmers'
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the data collection, the farmers'
responses were handwritten.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a measure for quality control,
we also did audio recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first step we did in processing the
data was to convert the handwritten notes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the digital format and do the
transcription of the audio recordings to
[SPEAKER_00]: word documents and later translate the
word documents from the three local
[SPEAKER_00]: languages to English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did the data analysis using SPSS
which is the software that is commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: used for analyzing social science data.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we asked the farmers
was to tell us the different, like about
[SPEAKER_00]: the cassava varieties that they were
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this graph showing the top nine
traits that they mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: On x-axis, the traits with the stars are
what farmers mentioned, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: currently not being addressed in the
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much as the farmers were interested in
high-yielding cultivars that are early
[SPEAKER_00]: maturing, they also mentioned that they
wanted cassava varieties whose roots get
[SPEAKER_00]: soft on boiling and whose roots can store
longer in ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also asked the farmers to tell us the
different ways in which they eat cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in here, the boiled form had the
highest proportion followed by the fra and
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves had the smallest proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other question we asked was to tell
us about the different attributes of
[SPEAKER_00]: cassava that were desirable for it to be
eaten in each of these forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this graph, I'm showing the top
seven traits that they mentioned that were
[SPEAKER_00]: priority for the cassava to be eaten in
the boiled form.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in the previous bar graph, the traits
with the stars are what the farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are currently not being addressed in
the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my next two studies, I've decided
to focus on softness of the cassava roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because currently, it was mentioned as the
number one trait for cassava to be eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: in the boiled form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently, it's not being addressed in
the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next study will be aimed at
optimizing the protocols we can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We established the trial to use for this
study in 2015 at two sites in Uganda using
[SPEAKER_00]: augmented block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genotypes that we used were 210
accessions that we collected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers who participated in the surveys,
along with 70 lines that we got from the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we harvested this trial last year in
October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at harvest, we collected the cassava
root samples, which are being analyzed for
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical properties that might relate
to softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we got to the laboratory,
we boiled the ecosystems of the cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: root at a constant temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we measured softness using the
penetrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the picture for the
penetrometer for those who are not
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also analyzing the samples for
different biochemical properties that may
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate to the quality preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we are doing this is
because if they are more highly heritable
[SPEAKER_00]: and highly correlated to the quality
preferences that we identified,
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeders could do indirect breeding
for those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this plot,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing the phenotypic variation for
the results we got for softness using the
[SPEAKER_00]: combined data set from the two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis, this is the force that
was used to penetrate through the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: after we boiled them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the x-axis are the different time
intervals at which we measured the
[SPEAKER_00]: softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to say, as you increase the
time of boiling, the force you use to
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate through the roots goes on
decreasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because as you boil the roots,
they get softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also computed the blood sensoritability
using Jim Lola and his method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one observed is the heritability
estimate increases as you increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: time of boiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you move from 45 minutes to 60
minutes, the heritability estimate becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because at 60 minutes,
most of the root samples have overcooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes hard to precisely measure
softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the analysis is still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we complete that, we will find
the correlations between the biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: properties and the quality preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the biochemical properties that
are highly correlated to softness,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will establish the scrolling scales
that can be used for their measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our last study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is looking at marker trait associations
for softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We established the trial to use last year
in October at two sites in Uganda using
[SPEAKER_00]: augmented block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used a diverse panel of 430
accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this picture, this is the field trial
at one of the sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be harvesting the trial in
October this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will phenotype the root samples for
softness using the protocol which we are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to develop in study two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, we will perform a
genome-wide association study to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: markers across the genome that are
associated with genetic variation for
[SPEAKER_00]: softness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier on, I said that we also collected
the cassava leaf samples from the farmers'
[SPEAKER_00]: fields during the surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have genotyped these ones and using
GBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm showing the piece here plot
for the genotype data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the different colors represent the
four districts where we collected the
[SPEAKER_00]: samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to note is, much as there
are some related genotypes grown across
[SPEAKER_00]: all the districts, there are some
genotypes that are only grown in some
[SPEAKER_00]: locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this could explain some of the
differences that we observed across the
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the differences in quality
preferences across the districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the genetic diversity of the farmers'
materials could also be exploited by the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders to improve cassava for the
quality preferences of smaller farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, we have been able to
identify the trait preferences that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important to smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are currently optimizing protocols
that we can use to measure some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: identified traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will be doing the genetic studies
to help us understand the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture for the identified traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this information will be useful to
the breeders in designing appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding strategies for the preferred
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I would like to acknowledge
