[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the kind
introduction, Julia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a pleasure to be back here at
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my third visit, and I have to say
it gets better every time, but it also
[SPEAKER_02]: gets colder every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being in Georgia, my winter coat is not,
I think, of the right caliber here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to have a tour this morning of the
Boyce Thompson Institute and enjoy the
[SPEAKER_02]: warmth of some of the different
plant-growing areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk today about our work on
medical ethnobotany as a discovery tool
[SPEAKER_02]: for identification of novel chemical
scaffolds for the purpose of drug
[SPEAKER_02]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: My main interest is in anti-infective drug
discovery, but we have also worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborators in looking for new scaffolds
to treat cancer and other viral targets
[SPEAKER_02]: other than our bacterial and fungal work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice here our little logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are any chemists in the room,
this is elagic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my first major projects was on
elagic acid derivatives from rubous
[SPEAKER_02]: species.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how that came into being.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about some of the
challenges that we have with antibiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go over the ethnobotany as a key
piece to the discovery toolkit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethnobotany has waxed and waned over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 80s and 90s, this was a very
respected approach that was used widely,
[SPEAKER_02]: also supported through the National Cancer
Institute to collect and look for new
[SPEAKER_02]: potential sources of compounds to treat
cancer, among other targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We faced a downturn in interest and
funding in the 90s, in the later 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even from 2000 onward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're finally getting back to
the place where people are starting to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back and realize that there's still a lot
to discover from the plant world in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of novel chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to talk about how we have
expanded this toolkit and then give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: few examples of discoveries in this arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the Elm Leaf Blackberry
Project, our work with chestnut,
[SPEAKER_02]: pepper tree, and St. John's wort.
[SPEAKER_02]: For any of you that attended my lecture
last month of the Tant Gardens,
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for any slides that overlap,
but I think what we're taking a deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: dive into the science of this talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the major reasons that we're
working on this area of infectious disease
[SPEAKER_02]: is because we're facing what is going to
be known as the post-antibiotic era.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the heyday of classic antibiotic
discovery starting in the 40s into the 50s
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of these metabolites from soil
microbes, but we haven't had much
[SPEAKER_02]: innovation in terms of antibiotic
discovery since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the new antibiotics are actually
just analogs of existing structural
[SPEAKER_02]: classes that have been released.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're facing a constant battle,
a game of leapfrog with these bugs in our
[SPEAKER_02]: search for drugs that will continue to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sums it up, I think, quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Antibiotic resistance is not a new thing
that has reached the limelight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alexander Fleming, not long after,
has received the Nobel Prize and put this
[SPEAKER_02]: statement out of the thoughtless person
playing with penicillin treatment is
[SPEAKER_02]: morally responsible for the death of the
man who succumbs to the infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They knew from the very beginning that
antibiotic resistance was going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: major problem if we did not take care of
them properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday on Twitter, if any of you are on
Twitter, I posted a screenshot from
[SPEAKER_02]: another scientist that's interested in
antibiotic stewardship, and he had a
[SPEAKER_02]: screenshot from the website Alibaba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys familiar with Alibaba?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you could buy, I mean, gram
quantities of some of our major
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics are used in human medicine,
as well as some of these that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: veterinary medicine, starting from 10 to
30 bucks online.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is exceptionally disturbing that
these are so easily accessible through
[SPEAKER_02]: international markets to get not only
being used recklessly in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: veterinary practices in terms of growth
promoters for animals, but also this kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of ease of access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through other avenues as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2016, the British government put
together a report.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is known as the O'Neill Report,
because it was chaired by the economist
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the key findings of this report is
that tackling antimicrobial resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: will require not only stronger attention
to stewardship, but also an adequate
[SPEAKER_02]: supply of new drugs to beat resistance as
it rises.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is troubling because we've seen a
continuous rise in rates of resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: and our current estimates of the number of
deaths globally from antimicrobial
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance are around 700,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many think that this is a very
conservative estimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anticipated to reach up to 10 million
per year with current rates of resistance
[SPEAKER_02]: by the year 2050.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first time ever, the World Health
Organization released a target list of
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens to work on for human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: These, you'll note, are missing
tuberculosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuberculosis is, of course, still a very
high priority for your discovery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just kind of kept that in a separate
class.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are some of the key ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones in purple we're working on in my
lab, as well as the one in red.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to focus mainly on our
Staphylococcal work, because that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: we have, I think, more data to present.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are pursuing discovery pathways for
some of the escape pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas,
Staph, Isineobacter, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: These gram-negative pathogens,
in particular, are very difficult to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: because of issues with penetration of the
outer membrane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're also working on trying to
find natural products from plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe, on their own, aren't necessarily
antimicrobial, but can actually potentiate
[SPEAKER_02]: or sensitize the bugs to existing lines of
antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a resistance-modifying
agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of our main approaches that
we're taking with these gram-negatives
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other troubling aspect to this
whole crisis is that, while we've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: rising rates of resistance, at the same
time, we've faced a big discovery void
[SPEAKER_02]: starting in the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any new registered classes
of antibiotics since the late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anytime you see in the news these new
antibiotics, again, they're not really
[SPEAKER_02]: new-new.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're based on the same scaffold,
just slightly modified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So resistance is a constant problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might work for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, again, we have resistance to
that class again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this also corresponded with a shift
in the way that we look for antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved further away from natural
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were still doing some work with soil
microbes and that kind of discovery for
[SPEAKER_02]: natural products, but not so heavily
emphasized on plants and more focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: products of combinatorial chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea during this period was,
if we can build large enough libraries of
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of thousands of compounds and
screen them with our new high-throughput
[SPEAKER_02]: robotics programs, that surely something
would hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And does anybody know how many antibiotics
came out of that initiative that was
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-multi-millions of dollars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a consequence of that is while we have
this emphasis more towards synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches, which I love synthetic
chemists.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't take this as an affront if you're
a synthetic chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the dire consequences of this
is we saw a drop in training of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that have that natural products expertise
and that are taking this approach of
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to different sources of nature for
these new products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other problem was that we kept
rediscovering a lot of the same compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: from these different soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are some of the latest
representatives of the novel antibacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: classes that were released more recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these is recently as 2007,
but again, these were discovered in the
[SPEAKER_02]: 1950s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to do better at discovery of
new classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are looking to a number of
different natural sources, still screening
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some innovative new techniques
that have emerged where there are new
[SPEAKER_02]: types of growth chambers, these iChip
devices that can be used to grow microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In their native soil environment,
there are folks that are working on marine
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to remote areas of the
planet, looking at extreme ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to identify perhaps other microbes
in the marine environment or other larger
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms in the marine environment as
sources of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are focusing on endophytes or fungi
that live within plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are focusing on genome mining,
going back to those original sources of
[SPEAKER_02]: antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some on animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some on animal proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So alligators, Komodo dragons,
these have been some of the interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: things that have popped out in the news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then plants and fungi are also the
area where we're particularly focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it should come as no surprise,
especially to this audience, that plants
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a reasonable place to look for
new compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a long history of successful drug
discovery from plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, many of the drugs that are in
the World Health Organization's list of
[SPEAKER_02]: essential medicines were originally
derived from plants and have since then we
[SPEAKER_02]: now synthesize or create these compounds
through other mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's a lot to be discovered
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also know that there are around 28,000
medicinal plants that have been documented
[SPEAKER_02]: on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from the recent Q Report.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think current estimates for total
species is somewhere around 400 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 450,000 species of plants known on Earth,
but 28,000 of those have been documented
[SPEAKER_02]: for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no formal numbers on how many
plants have actually been thoroughly
[SPEAKER_02]: investigated or their potential
bioactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the anti-infective field
goes, I would say it's in the very low
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of ones that have been really
looked at from a robust biological or
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do plants make these compounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about creation of secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different tissues will engage in different
biosynthetic pathways to create plants for
[SPEAKER_02]: the defense against microbial invasion or
infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, something that's interesting is that
perhaps we know that with fungi they can
[SPEAKER_02]: create compounds that actually kill other
organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants can as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're finding in my work is that
the signaling pathways between plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen, there might be a more intricate
or interesting communication system there
[SPEAKER_02]: where perhaps they're not just killing
these bugs, but are actually preventing
[SPEAKER_02]: their own or interfering with microbial
signaling systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we get into quorum
sensing interference, which is what I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other secondary metabolites are released
to attract pollinators and seed
[SPEAKER_02]: dispersers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're released to prevent other species
from germinating within their kind of grow
[SPEAKER_02]: zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, you have secondary
metabolites that can be upregulated to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent over-forging by animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other thing that I think was
really interesting is in 2015,
[SPEAKER_02]: more attention also got placed on the role
of plants in tree infectious disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: with Dr. Yu Yu Tu's received the Nobel
Prize for her discovery of artemisinin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I love about this story is that
it not only incorporated, it's not only a
[SPEAKER_02]: story about successful natural products
work, but it's also a story about the use
[SPEAKER_02]: of ethnobotanical tools in that discovery
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had yield problems when they were
working with artemisia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had yield problems with their active
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she actually went back to this
five-century-old text and looked up the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional way that this was prepared to
treat febrile illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, it was not created using
standard lab mechanisms of an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction or perhaps a hot aqueous
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it was wrung out in
room-temperature water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, they did get higher yields of
their active agent that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing that's interesting,
I think, from the artemisinin story is
[SPEAKER_02]: that now we have widespread artemisinin
resistance, of course, because we isolated
[SPEAKER_02]: that one single compound from the plant
and used it broadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of lessons to
be learned from this in that when you look
[SPEAKER_02]: at some of these other studies that have
actually tried whole plant therapy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get some restorative variation of
activity against the malaria parasite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there may be a role for all these other
structurally similar derivatives that are
[SPEAKER_02]: kicked off through that biosynthetic
pathway that maybe together in unison,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can help beat resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's an area that we're very
interested in when it comes to our
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-infective drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we actually doing a disservice by
isolating, only trying to develop single
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be better in some cases to
actually work on development of refined
[SPEAKER_02]: and rich extracts that are rich in these
molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of which might have actually
slightly less activity, but as a whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: work better together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll give you an example of that with
our Elmleaf blackberry work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our core research approach is we have
kind of four angles to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do field work.
[SPEAKER_02]: This summer, I was working in the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of field work also in
Albania and in Kosovo and the Balkans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also collect in the Southeast US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have plants that come from Florida
and also from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those US collections, we're
relying primarily on historic records of
[SPEAKER_02]: Native American medical uses of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our specimens are deposited in our
herbarium where you have taxonomic
[SPEAKER_02]: verification that what we field IDed is
correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are stored there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a phytochemistry lab,
which is where we extract the compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: and to start creating our library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have microbiology and cell
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of this is kind of run under the
umbrella of my research group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in taking the ethnobotanical approach
to drug discovery, again, we're starting
[SPEAKER_02]: with all of biological diversity,
but we're using this important lens of
[SPEAKER_02]: ethnobotany to narrow down the field even
beyond these 28,000 known medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, focusing primarily on plants that
are used to treat infectious and
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammatory disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm especially interested in skin disease
and in topical applications of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because from a chemistry perspective,
it's a lot easier to work with those
[SPEAKER_02]: because you don't have to worry as much
about compound degradation as you would
[SPEAKER_02]: with therapies that are taken internally
or orally.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are extracted and we work up
standard mass spec and NMR on these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that's interesting I think
about or unique about our collection is
[SPEAKER_02]: that we focus again in the Mediterranean
basin, the National Cancer Institute's
[SPEAKER_02]: large global collections they did on both
plants and also marine sources did not
[SPEAKER_02]: include Europe or the Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I could clearly say that of all the
collections that are out there for natural
[SPEAKER_02]: products, I think we have some unique
species or unique collection of species in
[SPEAKER_02]: this group.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the approach, we're using tools from
anthropology and tools from ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actively interviewing people about
how they're using plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The places that we work are very remote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes these people are reliant on
knowledge of which plants to collect in
[SPEAKER_02]: the wild for both their food and medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, some of our work in the
Balkans, they are isolated for about six
[SPEAKER_02]: months of the year with heavy snows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to actually grow or collect
all their food to last throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They then also ferment a lot of these
foods through lactic acid fermentation for
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And potatoes are their major crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are in a participant observation
of helping to plant potatoes with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also looking to old text as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an example of a text from the 16th
century that included notes from a Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: explorer traveling in South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the Brazilian pepper tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the plants that we've been
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are, when people ask me about how
do I pick my field site, everyone assumes
[SPEAKER_02]: for some reason I just like to go to Italy
for the wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, okay, it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a beautiful place to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a scientific rationale
behind, you know, why we're working in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of the global hotspots for
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over 25,000 plants that are native
to the Mediterranean basin, but 13,000 of
[SPEAKER_02]: those are endemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, again, a nice opportunity for
collecting a wide variety of biological
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity, which also then of course
corresponds to chemical diversity in our
[SPEAKER_02]: drug discovery initiatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is interesting is that,
you know, when you look at how people use
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in these areas, you have a
relatively small geographic region,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have multiple languages that are
spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different cultures, different
religions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we found that even people
that share the same ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is from our paper in nature plants,
we found that even people that share the
[SPEAKER_02]: same ecosystem, if they're from a
different culture that have different
[SPEAKER_02]: linguistic customs, and different customs
for their daily life, they actually use
[SPEAKER_02]: those natural resources in very different
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's especially relevant to how they
use some of these medicinal plants for day
[SPEAKER_02]: to day medical care.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to undertake this research,
we go through layers of prior informed
[SPEAKER_02]: consent with both village leaders and also
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We follow codes of ethics for this kind of
work where you're again gathering
[SPEAKER_02]: information from people and how they use
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also engage in access and benefit
sharing with local communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our work may or may not someday lead to
great outcomes in terms of translational
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes for medicine with lots of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always the hope, right,
that you can find a drug that gets
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is that most of these
probably won't, that won't occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really take a big emphasis on
engaging access and benefit sharing from
[SPEAKER_02]: the very get go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the things that we give back to
communities are languages or books in the
[SPEAKER_02]: local language.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run workshops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also engage in a lot of different
exchange programs with the students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the field, we're collecting these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're field dried and then shipped back
to the lab where they're ground up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: mill and then extracted and following
various procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be extracted through organic
extractions or boiling or in some cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: we also try and follow the traditional
means of extraction as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are then the solvents and removed
and we're working with these crude
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts in our initial screens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each extract from different plant
tissues may contain from several hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: to up to a thousand different small
molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our current library is now we have over
1200 extracts from plants and fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: These also we have a prefractionated
library on top of that on a large chunk of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what's nice is that these are
also highly biologically diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 50, 51 orders over 400 species and
they cover I think a good spectrum of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant diversity, which gives us a unique
chance to then screen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just 1200 compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably actually screening more in,
you know, the scale of the millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds because each of these is so
diverse and complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we get to the microbiology lab,
some of the classic ways that people have
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at the antibacterial potential of
medicinal plants has been following our
[SPEAKER_02]: standard in the box thought line of we
need things that kill or inhibit the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And across the board in the literature,
that's what you're going to find if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look for antibacterial activity of
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to see people that run these
microtiter broth assays, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically you have the bacteria growing in
culture and you look at optical density to
[SPEAKER_02]: see if your compounds block their growth
or kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also might see a lot of these disk
diffusion assays where you basically have
[SPEAKER_02]: an auger dish with compound on a disk or
compound in a well or extracts in a well
[SPEAKER_02]: and you look for zones of inhibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the standard of where a lot of
work is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do this, but I think what is
important as we go a step beyond because I
[SPEAKER_02]: think a lot of the rationale for why these
plants are being used in traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine is actually being missed this
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very easy to dismiss a traditional
medicine if you say, oh, this is used for
[SPEAKER_02]: a skin infection, but it doesn't kill any
of the bacteria that we know of that cause
[SPEAKER_02]: skin infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just an old wives tale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't work as junk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been the perspective a
lot of scientists have taken in this
[SPEAKER_02]: process in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're really trying to make a push
to encourage people to think about other
[SPEAKER_02]: potential mechanisms, other pathways where
these compounds might actually be working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at pathways that are
involved in recalcitrance of infections or
[SPEAKER_02]: long enduring chronic kind of wound
infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where biofilm comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at compounds that inhibit
quorum sensing or bacterial communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very important for virulence
factor production that's responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also looking for resistance
modification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can these actually potentiate or
resensitize other classic antibacterials?
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, there's also the host directed
impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an area that we haven't been
working, but I'm hoping to find a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: immunologist collaborator in the future to
take on this angle because we've been so
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on how does it interact with the
bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't often think about how does it
actually interact with the host,
[SPEAKER_02]: which might provide some interesting
insight for medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our approach for lead
identification, we're starting with field
[SPEAKER_02]: work or literature review.
[SPEAKER_02]: We collect the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go through taxidermy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're collecting plant DNA to have these
DNA barcoded and entered into
[SPEAKER_02]: international databases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are processing the materials in the
field and then going through this process
[SPEAKER_02]: of bioassay guided fractionation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at each step, you have something that's
incredibly complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We separate using chromatographic
techniques, then go back, retest and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to refine and refine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had another meeting about our
chestnut project where we were getting so
[SPEAKER_02]: close to identifying the active compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very disappointed to find that
that one peak that we found and isolated
[SPEAKER_02]: in a large quantity on our PrEP LC
actually turned out to be five compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like every time you get closer
and closer, it's just like the set of
[SPEAKER_02]: Russian dolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something else there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of also the exciting part
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an easy approach, but there's a
lot there to be discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Following bioassay guided fractionation,
we also go to animal studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use a lot of mouse models.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also use Galeria melonella models,
which are basically these insect models
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can use for looking at
pathogenesis for some of these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to focus today on Staph
aureus, because we have a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of different plants that interact
with this particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you some background,
Staphylococcus aureus is in the firmicute
[SPEAKER_02]: division of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a leading cause of bacteremia,
sepsis, brain abscess, medical implant
[SPEAKER_02]: device infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have new drugs, again, new drugs that
have been put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you talk to an infectious disease
doctor, they don't always work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work beautifully to test you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're dealing with a live
patient, these are incredibly difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: infections in some cases to treat,
especially for medical device infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing of interest is one in three of
you actually carry Staph aureus in your
[SPEAKER_02]: nose and your nares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't mean that you're going to become
sick from this, but it could lead to
[SPEAKER_02]: potential for transmission to other people
that are perhaps more immune compromised.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two different types of Staph
that play an important role in health.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is known as HA MRSA, or Healthcare
Associated MRSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stands for Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a resistant lineage that is
associated with infections of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are already sick in the hospital,
are there for surgery, or have some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of immune compromised state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there is Community Associated MRSA,
which is a new lineage that emerged in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past 15 to 20 years that allows this bug
to actually get into very healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll talk more about that and how some
of these plant compounds may play a role
[SPEAKER_02]: in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with biofilm and this idea
of intrinsic resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So biofilms can be either unimicrobial or
polymicrobial.
[SPEAKER_02]: These occur in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever looked at a slimy rock in a
stream, that's the slime is from a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are advantageous to microbes because
it provides them a safe haven and a place
[SPEAKER_02]: where they can kind of work cooperatively
with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it starts with initial adhesion to a
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow into these mushroom-like
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through these channels that you can
see here, that's where they exchange
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have much higher rates of genetic
exchange in these communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also release their waste products
through those channels and also take up
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's bad about the biofilm in terms of
the human host is that these are
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly difficult to clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they're in that growth state,
they also enter into a slower metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they grow slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Antibiotics work on rapidly dividing
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also more difficult for the
antibiotics to actually penetrate that
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharide matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also difficult for your immune system
to clear that matrix as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back to Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from some of my work I started off
doing as a graduate student, documenting
[SPEAKER_02]: how people in these rural villages were
treating skin and soft tissue infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to go around and ask hundreds of
people questions about what did they put
[SPEAKER_02]: on their skin for pushering?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a great conversation starter,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you remember that time you had that
nasty abscess with all that stuff coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you do for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a lot of really interesting
responses, everything from using slug
[SPEAKER_02]: slime to lots of different plants and even
some different industrial chemicals used
[SPEAKER_02]: in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that sounds like it'd be
painful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is one of those that popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was interesting is that they
would actually take the leaves and layer
[SPEAKER_02]: it with some aged pork fat on the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were also using the roots to
treat hair loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is basically a large briar patch,
so it's not easy to go in and collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also use the fruits as edible for
marmalades.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were over 116 different remedies
related to skin and soft tissue infections
[SPEAKER_02]: that we documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one that we collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when I looked at this in our models
for inhibition of growth, it does not
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibit growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, most people stopped at that
point when it came to evaluation of
[SPEAKER_02]: antimicrobials.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we went an additional step and asked
the question, OK, what other potential
[SPEAKER_02]: processes does this interact with?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we used this assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very simple crystal violet assay
where basically you grow your organisms in
[SPEAKER_02]: your 96-well plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they form a biofilm under certain
media conditions, basically they'll form a
[SPEAKER_02]: layer at the bottom of the well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other organisms will form.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll adhere to where the air-liquid
interface is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the staph forms at the bottom and
around the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question is, if we add these
extracts to the wells, as they're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to form the biofilm, can it stop them from
forming?
[SPEAKER_02]: And indeed, we found that it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an image from a confocal laser
scanning microscopy study where we have
[SPEAKER_02]: two different strains of staph.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a hospital strain taken from an
osteomyelitis patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a bone infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a strain of one of those more
aggressive community-acquired infections
[SPEAKER_02]: found in bloodstreams of healthy
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a mutant that basically does not
form a biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you add this, this is at different
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: 220 DF2 is our refined version of the
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's enriched for content of logic acid
glycosides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll get to why that's important in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see with those response,
at 100 micrograms per mil, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: basically no adhesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a glass slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green shows growth or live cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red is dead cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a healthy biofilm is composed of live
and dead cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're just not adhering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here you have at 50 micrograms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some that are adhering,
but not many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at 12 micrograms, you can see that
some of them are adhering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look here, this is a way of
looking at it from the side views.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the height of the towers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can envision, again, those
mushroom-shaped towers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens is, in the presence of the
drug, they form these very tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: unstable towers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about it from the
perspective of architecture, if you build
[SPEAKER_02]: a building too tall, what happens to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not as fit of a structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our next question is, in the
presence of these compounds, can we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually remove an established biofilm?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the golden question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an implanted device,
let's say you have your knee replacement
[SPEAKER_02]: gets infected, currently, the way that
it's treated in the hospital is the
[SPEAKER_02]: physician's going to put you under high
doses of antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go in and drain the pus,
because it's red and large and inflamed
[SPEAKER_02]: and oozing pus and infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to scrape it out or debride
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have to remove the device,
put in a temporary device that's embedded
[SPEAKER_02]: with antibiotics that will leach
antibiotics into the area for a while,
[SPEAKER_02]: put you back on IV antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after it looks like you're healed,
they'll come back in, take the temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: device out, put in a long-term device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for some of these procedures,
the recurrence rate of infection is up to
[SPEAKER_02]: 40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are not good odds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our current standard of therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we had ways to actually prevent that
biofilm from attaching in the first place
[SPEAKER_02]: or actually treating a patient that has
this kind of infection with something that
[SPEAKER_02]: eradicates or removes that biofilm without
actually having to remove the whole device
[SPEAKER_02]: that's embedded in your bone, that would
be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the question we asked here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we take these plant compounds and
remove that goopy biofilm community from a
[SPEAKER_02]: device?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a piece of IV catheter,
so the same kind of IVs that go into your
[SPEAKER_02]: arm when you're in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took one centimeter segments,
grew the biofilm on it, and then treated
[SPEAKER_02]: it through a series of days in different
media, containing either just growth
[SPEAKER_02]: media, the biofilm inhibitor alone,
antibiotic alone, or biofilm inhibitor
[SPEAKER_02]: plus antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we were disappointed to find that and
blue is the biofilm control and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: the biofilm inhibitor in orange,
that we had no drop in adhered cells when
[SPEAKER_02]: treating with just the biofilm inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't able to remove the
established biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the antibiotic,
this is 10 times the typical dose of
[SPEAKER_02]: Daptomycin, it's 10 times the breakpoint
MIC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only had a very small, this is not
even quite two log drop in adherent cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what got us excited is that when you
combined the inhibitor plus antibiotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: we saw a large five log drop in adhered
cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is after seven days of treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't completely clear the biofilm,
but this gives you a sense of how
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult these are to treat, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we have to actually remove the
device.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is bringing us steps closer to
thinking about different ways to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: these kinds of infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, within this mixture, this is a
refined mixture, we knew that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: aologic acid and a bunch of these
glycosidic forms of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we found that each time that we tried
to separate the extract, past that point
[SPEAKER_02]: of 220DF2, we started losing activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we recombined it in multiple
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took our fractions and recombined
fraction one and 10 and eight and 10 and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of them together in all these
different myriad ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way we were able to restore
the total activity of 220DF2 is if we
[SPEAKER_02]: actually put the entire thing back
together of 220DF2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you that do any natural
products, isolation, you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: isolating enough of each individual
compound from the extract can be very time
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming and difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went down the hill to chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Dr. Emily Weiner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, can you just make these for
me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize at the time I was giving
her a brick, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because aologic acid has serious
solubility issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she actually generated a number of
different glycosidic forms of the aologic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found from this study was that
the type of sugar did matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw some enhanced activity with single
compounds that had certain kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we found overall, again,
is that that enriched botanical fraction
[SPEAKER_02]: that had a composition of many different
aologic acid glycosides was still the most
[SPEAKER_02]: active.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was, I think, interesting and goes
back again to this idea that I brought up
[SPEAKER_02]: before the artemisinin is actually this
enriched composition better than going to
[SPEAKER_02]: a single drug in some cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also wanted to look and see what other
organisms does this work against.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did this in collaboration with Dr.
Jorge Vidal, who's at Emory's School of
[SPEAKER_02]: Public Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's an expert in streptococcus
pneumoniae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found with strep pneumoniae
was very interesting is that in this case,
[SPEAKER_02]: 222-DF2 actually did kill strep
pneumoniae.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also broke up established biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really exciting that here it
actually behaves differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another gram-positive compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does have some potential here also
for other avenues of development for strep
[SPEAKER_02]: pneumoniae infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's get back to
community-associated MRSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where my quorum-sensing work,
I think, really comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an epidemic, I mentioned,
that really shocked the medical community
[SPEAKER_02]: and the public health officials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because traditionally, again, staff was
something that affected sick people or
[SPEAKER_02]: people that had implants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, all of a sudden, you started
seeing football players, military
[SPEAKER_02]: personnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about 19-year-old men and the
prime of health, very fit, very
[SPEAKER_02]: immune-stable, that were coming down with
these really severe infections,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy one day and at death's door in a
few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really serious kinds of
infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: They often would present as a skin
infection in the ER.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, still staff skin infections are
very common in the ER.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're often confused by people as being
spider bites.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever see this kind of circular
infection that has a red hole in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle, that's not a spider bite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often it's staff aureus kind of skin
infection in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that hole is caused by these toxins
that staff produces that can cause this
[SPEAKER_02]: necrotic lesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they found is you had this severe
sorts of infections were starting off with
[SPEAKER_02]: the skin and then moving systemically and
affecting people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they did is they took these
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a classic study where they tried to
replicate what they were seeing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the hospital strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you injected that into the bloodstream
of the mouse, the mouse survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mice are actually quite good at fighting
off staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you took one of these new
community-associated strains, you started
[SPEAKER_02]: to see deaths in mice within a very short
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was something different that
these bugs were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is not about drug resistance.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about virulence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staff exotoxins, which are part of that
virulence package, are associated with a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the classic ones is toxic shock
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a big problem in a period where
you had women using super absorbent
[SPEAKER_02]: tampons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were taken off the market for the
long-term use because of this association.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have scalded skin syndrome and
neonates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This actually is caused by exfoliative
toxins that makes the baby skin fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extremely dangerous because, of course,
you're removing that important immune
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier and can be opened up for
additional secondary infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the hallmark is abscesses,
necrosis, and sepsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about this from the
ethno-botany perspective, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that people can describe this to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can tell me, I saw this on my skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it's a rash, it spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had fluid.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fluid was clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fluid was postulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a lot of information from
visual confirmation by people using plants
[SPEAKER_02]: for these kinds of indications.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes this kind of staff so potent is
that it has this increased capacity to
[SPEAKER_02]: release toxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use this capacity to recruit
neutrophils and basically are gobbled up
[SPEAKER_02]: by the neutrophil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they're inside, they release a burst
of toxin and actually actively attack your
[SPEAKER_02]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what makes them able to get into
the bloodstream from these skin infections
[SPEAKER_02]: and spread throughout the body in a much
more effective way than the other classic
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital-associated ones did.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was doing my PhD work, there was a
lot of talk by folks at NIH like Michael
[SPEAKER_02]: Otto had a lot of really interesting
papers that were more opinion papers and
[SPEAKER_02]: forward-thinking papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if we could come up with drugs to
target this system of communication that
[SPEAKER_02]: controls virulence?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always the big what if.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people that were working on
some peptide signaling agents and
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, at the time, of course, was working on
these postulate wounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, well, maybe this is a way
that could explain how some of these work
[SPEAKER_02]: in the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I teamed up with Dr. Horswell,
who's an expert in the accessory gene
[SPEAKER_02]: regulator system and staff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was able to build a number of tools
that we use to assess these compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea here is to use a quorum quenching
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not actually killing the organism,
but limiting its ability to communicate
[SPEAKER_02]: either through releasing signals or
receiving signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the system looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a constant release of these
auto-inducing peptides into the cell's
[SPEAKER_02]: extracellular environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are recognized here by AGRC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This triggers a phosphorylation event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then downstream, you have a production of
a number of different toxins, including
[SPEAKER_02]: superantigen, cytolysins, things that can
burst open immune cells, red blood cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: degrade your tissue, and also help get
past that skin barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really important for the skin
barrier function.
[SPEAKER_02]: In dermatology, we're always concerned
with skin barrier function.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you lose that shield of your skin,
if your skin barrier is degraded in any
[SPEAKER_02]: way, it opens you up for invasion by not
only staff, but other pathogens in the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also opens you up to more contact with
allergens in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is relevant for diseases also like
eczema.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you are familiar
with eczema.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 20% of kids in the US and other
developed countries deal with eczema or
[SPEAKER_02]: atopic dermatitis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staff is heavily involved in that disease
as well because of its role in impacting
[SPEAKER_02]: skin barrier function and causing itch
through mast cell degranulation and
[SPEAKER_02]: histamine release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to Italy again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another case where we documented
the use of chestnut.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just your standard chestnut grown
across Europe for its edible fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had documentation of local people using
the leaves of chestnut as an
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-inflammatory agent for inflammatory
skin disease, much like what you would see
[SPEAKER_02]: in a classic eczema patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we looked at this plant,
found it did not inhibit the growth of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really do much on biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does inhibit this signaling system
in staph aureus.
[SPEAKER_02]: By taking these, basically in some of
these studies, we grew the bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_02]: presence of the plant extract and then
looked at the damage that the cell
[SPEAKER_02]: supernatant, this is basically the waste
products of the bacteria we put onto human
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The waste product would normally contain a
lot of these toxins that are excreted from
[SPEAKER_02]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put that onto a cell line,
you're going to see all of your cells are
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to die and we're working with
human skin cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those skin cells die.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that were pre-treated though,
with our extract, we found that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: protected because there's no toxin in that
supernatant because you're turning off
[SPEAKER_02]: their ability to release toxin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to see how this works in an
animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this model, you have this little mouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for any of you that get disturbed by
animal images.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little mouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take one of those nasty
community-associated MRSA strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: affects healthy people, inject it into the
skin dermis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an intradermal injection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that after two days,
this big necrotic lesion occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: By release of toxins, the staph is
degrading the skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we tried to then, at the same time as
we give the bacteria, we also give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: small dose of the chestnut extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a refined extract again of ursine
and olein in derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: At five micrograms, you see a much smaller
lesion, but it still forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 50 micrograms, there's no lesion
formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see this little pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, this is not an antibiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually killing the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bugs are still there, but you've just
completely disarmed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different way of thinking about how
do you fight your enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of Sun Tzu's Art of War.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to think more about that
when we think about how to better manage
[SPEAKER_02]: infectious disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you disarm your enemy by other means?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacteria is still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just can't cause any damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an immune-competent organism,
you can then clear out that infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go forward to another story.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a Brazilian pepper tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our more recent publication.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Brazilian pepper tree, this is a plant
that is shyness hermitifolia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the Anacardiaceae.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a relative of mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important in traditional
medicine in South America, especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazilian medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of records of many
different ways it was used and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different cases of infectious disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fruits were understudied, though,
I found in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to go and collect some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I'm from this part of Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see why I'm not used to the cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my county.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some students down and we went and
collected more of the fruits and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an invasive species in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a noxious weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are actually big programs that are
geared towards removal of this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hated plant, which is kind of an
underdog story for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the chemistry lab, we take that
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a basic methanolic crude extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: We then undergo liquid-liquid
partitioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are basically just standard ways of
separating compounds based on polarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then go to flash chromatography.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go on to prep or semi-prep and so
on to isolate compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see at each stage, here's the
crude extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we enrich it or as we work on those
more active parts, you can see you have
[SPEAKER_02]: greater concentration of these active
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our assays, I wanted to show you a few
examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a reporter system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are four types of signaling systems
in staff of four different peptides that
[SPEAKER_02]: AGR releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have reporters for each of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to control closely for growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found it's not inhibiting growth in any
of these reporters, but it is blocking
[SPEAKER_02]: their ability to signal or communicate
between each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, in our mouse model, we saw that you
have your lesion.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this case, we had 50 microgram
injection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as effective as a chest snap,
but again, you see the same kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: activity of blocking that necrotic
pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, for the first time, showed this
in the live model using fluorescent
[SPEAKER_02]: reporter strains in the live mouse that we
are in the mouse also targeting this
[SPEAKER_02]: specific gene system to help prevent
necrotic lesion formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for those of you, this is what we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a clean version of the extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant extracts are, of course,
incredibly chemically complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now focused on trying to isolate
these individually through prep
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatography to then do more work to
understand which of these compounds are
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, thinking about this question of,
do they work better together?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my main concerns, if you go back to
these four different AGR signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: peptides, is it might be that the mixture
works better overall because it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have a physician AGR
type your infection.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say, is it staff or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to go beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could be advantageous to have a
mixture that targets all four types.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what else was interesting is that
we showed that this does not inhibit
[SPEAKER_02]: growth of your skin commensals.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges in antibiotic
development is that while we're hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: these nasty bugs, at the same time,
we're also killing all of your commensal
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we have big issues with C.
[SPEAKER_02]: diff infections in the gut when you clear
out your healthy commensal system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found, in skin organisms at least,
with the exception of acne, this does not
[SPEAKER_02]: inhibit growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the different targets we're
working on are, again, looking to atopic
[SPEAKER_02]: dermatitis, acute bacterial and skin soft
tissue infections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually thinking more broadly now
also towards veterinary medicine because
[SPEAKER_02]: atopic infections in dogs is actually also
quite common.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're thinking about a doggy cream
formulation for this as well as maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: first place to start because the hurdles
to getting this into a clinical study in
[SPEAKER_02]: dogs are much lower than going to humans
as a first starting place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk just briefly about this one
last plant of St. John's wort.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've all probably heard of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Hyperica perforatum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's used in the Balkans in an interesting
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually create a sun oil infusion of
the flowering aerial parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go to your standard health food
store, you don't find that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: formulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see they have organic extracts that
are sold either in liquid or tablet form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, mainly used for mental health
rather than infectious disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we document in our studies over and
over in the Balkans is that this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular formulation, it's locally known
as Cantarion, is incredibly important for
[SPEAKER_02]: the treatment management of skin disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my things I was worried about is
that the presence of hypericin in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dietary supplement tablets can actually
cause a disease called hypericism,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a photoreactive skin disease
basically, you're more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_02]: getting sunburned easily when you have
this in your diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, here we have these people
that are rubbing this all over their skin
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time, and yet there were no
reports of hypericism.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were no reports of skin
photoreactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was, is it because they're
formulating in a different way that they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually are at lower risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the major antibacterial compound here
is hypericin, and hyperforin also has some
[SPEAKER_02]: antibacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the compound that causes that
photoreactive side effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was actually a study done by one of
my undergraduates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love working with undergrads in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and get students when they start as
sophomores and they work with me all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way through senior year.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a co-first author on this paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he did is he went and got different
tablets from supplement stores,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also worked with the plant
materials that we collected in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Balkans, as well as the traditional
formulation of this prepared in olive oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: or in sunflower oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found is that when you look at
growth inhibition, the tablets and
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements, and even the aqueous and
methanol extracts were potently
[SPEAKER_02]: antibacterial, but they also had very high
levels of hypericin, whereas the oils
[SPEAKER_02]: really didn't have much antibacterial
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, traditional medicine, but is not
killing staph or any of these skin
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria that cause this disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we looked at quorum sensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw it did have some moderate quorum
quenching activity in the oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be one potential explanation
for why this works so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we looked at the chromatograms
through mass spec, evaluating each of
[SPEAKER_02]: these formulations, what we found across
the board again, is that the oils lacked
[SPEAKER_02]: the presence of hypericin.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are indeed lacking the toxic
compound and not eliciting a standard
[SPEAKER_02]: antibacterial activity, but have some mild
anti-quorum sensing activity, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: some mild anti-biofilm activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't show that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wrap up here and just say
that I think that one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can do in the plant sciences is to
think more broadly, also concerning,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, this idea of signaling in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are signaling with organisms in
their environment for their own survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, we also have crossover with
targets into human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is an interesting area to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, again, that traditional medicine
can help us to focus in on those species
[SPEAKER_02]: that are most likely to have some
interference with the human pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get a chance to talk about our
other targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have some really cool projects
ongoing right now with collaborators on
[SPEAKER_02]: Zika virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've found a really potent inhibitor of
replication for Zika.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also working on some of these
superbug fungus infections like Candida
[SPEAKER_02]: auris from some of our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not yet published, but will be
hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to wrap up with, can we look
beyond these old paradigms of kill,
[SPEAKER_02]: kill, kill?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as we come to the end of the
antibiotic era, we have to think about
[SPEAKER_02]: paradigm shifts in medicine and a role
that some of these different, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: signaling inhibitors might play in
managing disease in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'll end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how far we've got for
questions, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably a lot more microbiology
than you guys were hoping for in a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking, you talked about
having these compounds that are not really
[SPEAKER_01]: killing the bacteria, but just quenching
the virus of the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think from the evolutionary point
of view, do you think these will be maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: less strong liver system because they're
less threatening?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the other kind of thing
that everyone wants is the
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance-proof drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think it depends on whether or not
you have additional selective pressures at
[SPEAKER_02]: play.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps resistance could evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's less likely than the direct
selective pressures that we have with
[SPEAKER_02]: classic antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've actually done a lot of resistance
studies with these drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot of serial packaging,
basically growing these in the presence of
[SPEAKER_02]: the corn punchers over generations and
have not found any drop in their ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to quench signaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that was in the absence of an
additional selective pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be optimal is if we could do
this in an animal model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been thinking about ways to do this,
perhaps, in malaria, melanella,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the insect model.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could then pass it through generations
of insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we have on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried to see any synergistic
effects of your combination of compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: from the different plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Making a formula of different plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your compounds that you know,
some that affect biofilm, some that affect
[SPEAKER_00]: forum sensing, and see if there's a
synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've focused mainly on combinations with
existing antibiotics, but that could be an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the reason I haven't really done
it is more from a translational
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already really difficult to get an
IND going on these when you have through
[SPEAKER_02]: the botanical drug pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: For these, I think if I'm combining
different extracts, that's not permissible
[SPEAKER_02]: under that pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from an inquiry standpoint,
that could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese medicine has a lot of knowledge of
botanical medicine.
It's also very messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you think about the future of
traditional Chinese medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that traditional Chinese medicine
is incredibly complex, and you can spend a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifetime studying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are a lot of interesting
bioactive ingredients used in traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to study it with the tools that we
have today, you would need to really look
[SPEAKER_02]: at perhaps single plant tissues to start
off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the future, as we advance these
different metabolomic approaches,
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps there are better ways to study the
complex mixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the problems with some of these
forms of medicine is if you're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually collect the fresh plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a botanist, I always emphasize actual
identification of the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go into a traditional Chinese
medicine shop, there are lots of dried
[SPEAKER_02]: bits of plants and roots and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's difficult to ensure that you
have the correct species that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's a fascinating area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already deal in so much complexity
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of working on ingredients from
five different species and different
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues into one formulation is just
beyond my capacity to deal with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
