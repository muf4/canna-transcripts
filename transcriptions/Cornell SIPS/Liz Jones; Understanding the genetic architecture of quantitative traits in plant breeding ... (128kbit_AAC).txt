[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so my talk today is about
understanding the genetic architecture of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative traits and this endless quest
that we have to try and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative traits and whether it's
really fruitful in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to build, as Susan said,
on some of my experiences in my PhD and my
[SPEAKER_00]: postdocs and also my time in industry and
finish off with telling you something
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Gobi project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my PhD, I was incredibly lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a perfect project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to work on pearl millet down in
Mildew in India and pearl millet is just
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these beautiful long panicles laden
with pearl-shaped seeds and the seeds can
[SPEAKER_00]: be ground, made into a flour or a
porridge, made into a beer or it can pop
[SPEAKER_00]: like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very versatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a higher nutrient content than
rice or wheat, so it's really a very
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, it can grow in the hot,
sandy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pHs, low nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can withstand long periods of no
rainfall and then when it rains,
[SPEAKER_00]: it covers a very rough, so it's really an
amazing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also a success, the Green
Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two male sterile lines produced
in Tipton, Georgia in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and with those, they started to produce
hybrids and those hybrids were very
[SPEAKER_00]: successful and were widely accepted and
were spread all over India when the first
[SPEAKER_00]: of several major epidemics occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Causing a massive loss in yield from 13 to
3 million metric tons in a single year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the disease is caused by a pathogen
called sclerosporograminicola.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an umicid, an obligate by a troph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance is quantitative, so you see a
continuous distribution when you screen
[SPEAKER_00]: for resistance, but it's also
environmentally variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's obviously some either
environmental differences or pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little was known about the disease
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few single zoospor isolates and no
differentials are being characterized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a really amazing pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of growing into the leaf and
forming a local lesion, what it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: does is it grows down to the growing point
of the plant and it will infect
[SPEAKER_00]: undifferentiated tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you actually see for these
half-leaves, this was the part of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: that was undifferentiated at the time of
infection and this part was
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get these half-leaf symptoms
showing infection, which is very typical
[SPEAKER_00]: of the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in earlier stages of infection,
you get this really wild panicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this panicle has been transformed from
that beautiful long panicle to this
[SPEAKER_00]: phylloideal tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my project was to map QTLs for
resistance perl millet and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine restrictions, they couldn't
take the pathogens from parts of Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: and parts of India and move them to
another location to do trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very strictly, were not allowed
to move any of those disease plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my supervisor was in India at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working at ICROSAT, which is the
International ICROS Research Institute for
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-Arid Tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they were working on perl
millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to settle back then in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he decided to bring all those pathogen
populations back to the UK and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: screening there, which was a little crazy
because the place he chose in the UK was
[SPEAKER_00]: North Wales, which is the rainiest place
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think Seattle is rainy,
it's like three or four times the rainfall
[SPEAKER_00]: of Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the rainiest places in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But surprisingly, perl millet liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me doing Daniel Mildew screens in
Bangor in Wales in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also replicated the screens in
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to cut a long story short,
this was the essence of the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perl millet has seven linkage groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of these graphs is a separate
linkage group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the different color lines showing
QTLs to each of the different pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the y-axis is the log of the odds
ratio, LOD score with a threshold of about
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing you see are these
huge enormous QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every pathogen population had a QTL major
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also some QTLs of minor effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see on linkage groups six and
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amazing thing was those QTLs were
extremely stable over repeated screens,
[SPEAKER_00]: different disease pressures in the fields
of the greenhouse, exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the minor ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did carry on to try and isolate
singles, these four isolates from the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen population and found even more
QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we tried a new pathogen
population, more and more QTLs would pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a huge amount of A virulences in the
pathogen population and a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance in the perl millet materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a real success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a very popular hybrid called
HHB67, which was susceptible to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by intergressing one of these
Danimildy resistances into HHB67,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could make it resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how long in that kind of environment
can you have a resistance last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably two to three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the perl millet breeders have actually
been very clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've diversified their parental
materials that are going into hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've intergressed new resistance genes
over time and they've stacked resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this very diverse host pathogen
environment where easily they could have
[SPEAKER_00]: had burst after burst and just continuous
epidemics, they've managed to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing yields over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great success story,
QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, this is what I find is more
typically the case, is the project I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on with late blight resistance in
tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The late blight is caused by phytophorin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very serious disease in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's best known for causing the Irish
potato famine of the 1800s, which caused
[SPEAKER_00]: mass starvation and emigration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resistance lasts two to three years in
potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they tend to look for general
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many, many QTLs of small effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we tried to do in
tomato, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were working with UC Riverside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a project at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a pathologist called Mike Coffey.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd found this wild tomato line that was
resistant to over 100 isolates of
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophorin festins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And forgive me if I get the names wrong
because they've changed the names of the
[SPEAKER_00]: species for tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was Hasutum is now Hapricates and
what was Aspilentum is now like Persica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this shows side by side after
inoculation, the wild species completely
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned no disease and Aspilentum's pretty
much meltdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did bidirectional backcrosses and
map QTLs in the bidirectional backcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the results of this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing three of tomato's 12
chromosomes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we saw were QTLs on every
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the QTLs would overlap,
but the peaks were not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct, the peaks of these little
triangles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Aspilentum, genetic map on the
left, and the Hasutum on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we screened, the more QTLs we
found, the more confused we were with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we were going to do with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were finding, because we were
also mapping architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprisingly, we were dealing with BC1
populations, which was probably a big
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake to be mapping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Aspilentum, or like a person who is
Mexican, is this nice compact bushy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hasutum is this horrible, wieldy,
rambling, indeterminate plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we ended up mapping was
a lot of QTLs for plant architecture and
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more open the canopy is, the less
disease, the less humid it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the less disease is built up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did, oh, this was one of the QTLs
that I was particularly excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wanted to see where this QTL
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a QTL for dispersal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the cultivated parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just see the little droplet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that on the leaf after
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the droplet just disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like magic, just disappears into the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's thought to be due to the
different trichome differences that the
[SPEAKER_00]: wild species have compared to Aspilentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is pretty exciting because
trichome differences and the wax of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf has also been shown to have resistant
properties to insects as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we definitely pursued this QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a lot to take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each of these mini blocks is basically
a different line, a set of integration
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just showing four different
QTLs here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the QTLs are in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, this line has four
QTLs interest to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has none.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's between one and four of all
the QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge amount of work back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold them with caps markers,
which are amplified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you restrict them and you run
them out in a gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a massive amount of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we saw when screening this
material, that we just didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything we could work with in plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: QTL were all co-located with some QTL
having a negative effect on the germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as plant height, shape, maturity,
yield, and fruit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these QTLs were usable in the
plant breeding sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was published, which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's good to have negative results
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of being productive for
breeding, it had very limited,
[SPEAKER_00]: no use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd had several of these projects where
I was getting increasingly frustrated with
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to move QTLs into cultivated
germplasm, being able to move them into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of sick of just collecting
QTLs and never going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, I'm pretty sure industry has
found an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was recruited to industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lots of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have systems in place to be able to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sure I would be able to map QTLs
there and move them into products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I was disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue that we had in industry,
at least in the environment that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working in, some maize and corn,
I mean maize and soybean, was that parents
[SPEAKER_00]: are extremely, are cycled extremely fast
through the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make your selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're constantly shifting that curve for
yield and moving it towards higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you have those selections
from the progeny, those become the new
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never using old parents again and
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always new parents going into that
breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you make progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had a QTL, and you mapped a
QTL, you really have to slow down this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole process to be able to integrate that
QTL into one of the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You often have to do it by bridge back
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless your QTL was of very high
value, so basically a gene of major
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, it was just not valuable to the
breeders to be able to fit it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you remember they're also
intergressing trans genes, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to manage herbicide resistance,
multiple insect traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: QTLs just don't make it to the top of
their list at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And association mapping was, there were a
couple of groups working on association
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping, even less fruitful, because most
association mapping populations don't
[SPEAKER_00]: contain elite lines, don't contain lines
of high relevance to breeding population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if a QTL is found,
it's really not going to make it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer, and I've got one of
Jean-Luc's papers up here, is to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to map QTLs in the actual breeding
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your breeding populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be small, but you can use
pedigree information and you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: shared haplotypes to be able to map the
QTLs as you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not mapping QTLs in separate
populations and then bringing the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it actually in the breeding
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a second method.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very popular in the soybean
breeding program called breeding bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically that just looked at the,
very, very simple, looked at the alleles
[SPEAKER_00]: and ancestral populations and the alleles
and the elite populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was an increase in frequency,
breeders had selected from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders are good, so they must be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was the premise, and it was
actually very, very successful at
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying QTLs in soybean populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from, over time, we had so many of
these QTLs in our database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them were closely linked or had
pleiotropic effects and closely linked
[SPEAKER_00]: with positive and negative alleles in
cysts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so breeders weren't going to spend the
time to try and break up those
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you actually had QTL,
the favorable and unfavorable would flip
[SPEAKER_00]: in different populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really became too much information
for breeders to be able to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I think about how we were handling
these QTLs, it was like a game of
[SPEAKER_00]: whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a QTL would pop up in one
generation and disappear in the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're constantly trying to find where
the QTL is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize for this next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a new cat in my house, and I think
cats are really cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what I imagine it's like to be
the breeder trying to predict when the
[SPEAKER_00]: QTLs are going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a more serious representation of
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: QTLs, it illustrates it very nicely,
just having diminishing impact on big
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture in terms of breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the slide I actually borrowed
or stole from Roberta Tuberosa with a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, forgiven QTL can have positive,
null or negative effects depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, it was drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: This complication has slowed considerably
the utilization of DNA for plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine that everyone was
extremely excited when genomic selection
[SPEAKER_00]: came on the scene and started to make
waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to see that we could make a
real impact with genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic selection doesn't try and
understand the underlying genes of
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is there to prove the trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your training population,
which has been phenotyped and genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's used to train your breeding
material, which has only got genotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't phenotype it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That saves you a huge amount of money to
just genotype it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You calculate what's called GBV or genetic
estimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building values and make selections based
on those values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really what is going to take corn
yields through to the next generation and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep improving yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And John Hickey, he's a quantitative
geneticist at the Roslin Institute,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a nice quote for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He feels like molecular biologists took
over plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be the domain of quantitative
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these QTLs were suddenly
molecular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneticists were the ones that were
running plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with genetic selection,
quantitative geneticists have taken that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding back into their own arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it for some of the very
visible products that Pioneer has had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've bred drought tolerant corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's been some seminars here on
this for a product called, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: a series of products called Aquamax,
where they're using genomic selection to
[SPEAKER_00]: select the high yield under well watered
conditions and high yield under drought
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see the Aquamax products at
these green squares, which have very high
[SPEAKER_00]: yields under drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most interestingly, these
precommercial corn along next,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just even more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was working in markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my job was to find the best set of
markers to implement genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And practically, you don't need many.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows the number of snips needed to
give good prediction accuracy in European
[SPEAKER_00]: corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this was some dialyl mating
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at about 300 markers, you pretty
much got a plateau for your prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no need to go above 300 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine in a maize double
haploid breeding population, going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: even fewer markers that you're going to
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of technology was a challenge to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be low cost and low cost,
as in equal to the cost of a corn plot or
[SPEAKER_00]: less or soybean plot, which is about $5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be very robust, a high
percentage of data, whether you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible samples coming in from some part
of the world or really bad DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be really stable across
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a consistent data matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the turnaround time,
you can't be imputing data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be messing around trying to
match up data sets with different markers
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Readers really like to add their own trace
specific markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be flexible and be able to
add in markers over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one important key, just to mention,
here because the industry took a foray
[SPEAKER_00]: into sequencing GBS technologies,
low sequence coverage technologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just found that the bioinformatics was
too expensive and too time consuming to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really needed a technology that
just delivers you the genotyping matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: with a very fast turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technologies in this space, I'm not sure
what they're called now, but they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be called their next generation genotyping
or targeted sequencing technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are in between sequencing and
genotyping technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have specific primers and probes that
can be amplicon based or ligase based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything just goes into one big
bucket and is amplified at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the samples are barcoded, so you can
distinguish between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most popular one right now is the
RampSeq technologies that Ed Buckle's been
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at by IDT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really low cost and also highly
multiplexed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the turnaround time that
we were dealing with, May's double haploid
[SPEAKER_00]: production, after you'd doubled your
material, you had about two weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more data you could get back,
before transplanting the better because
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting was extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted to be able to get GEDVs
back within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was about a data sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a few samples, that's tens
of thousands of samples in that one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: About a day for DNA extraction,
maybe two days for shipping, two days for
[SPEAKER_00]: loading your data and doing your genomic
selection analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They left five days to get your genotyping
data back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the kind of timelines we had
to meet in the double haploid scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so genotyping became less about
science, more about running logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What steps can I co-locate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my double haploid lab in the
middle of South America with very limited
[SPEAKER_00]: workforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I put my DNA prep lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't put it next to my double haploid
lab because I'm probably going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have to have my DNA extraction
lab separate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those days, vendors didn't want to
mess around with plant DNA extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you pretty much had two steps of
shipping from double haploid to DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction to your genotyping lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really had to have end-to-end
systems, end-to-end communication amongst
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different components.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest risk in this whole thing
became shipping and customs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding which countries would
tolerate important export of all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meanwhile, back to my current project,
back in the developing countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: this graph from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation shows increases in yield
[SPEAKER_00]: between 61 and 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the US and China yields
just going through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like three or four times the amount
of yield in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: India, it's had some increase,
but not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Africa is actually pretty flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not significantly different over all
of that time, almost 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is exactly where you need to have
good yields is where the populations are
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
decided that one of the solutions for this
[SPEAKER_00]: was to start implementing genomic
selection in the breeding programs that
[SPEAKER_00]: support these countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomic selection needs good data
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where Gobi was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of this project is to
transform breeding by enabling the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of genomic and
marker-assisted selection as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: routine breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by routine, I mean all of those
logistics that we were talking about in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry have to be able to come together
to be able to implement genomic selection
[SPEAKER_00]: in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main goals was to build databases,
to connect to breeding management systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to build and connect tools and
analysis pipelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're a global community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are based here at Cornell and also at
the Boyce Thompson Institute down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborate with three different CG
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: CIMIT, which is in Mexico for maize and
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICRICET in India for sorghum and
chickpeas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've come full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now working back with ICRICET.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ERI in the Philippines where we work
with rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two great institutes,
Diversity Arrays and the James Hutton
[SPEAKER_00]: Institute for tool development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've built within this community a
database that is super fast at being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to load data and extract data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The client interacts with the system via a
data loader or a data extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can load any kind of data into the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You interact with the system via web
services and APIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data's digested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're using a hybrid database system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use Postgres to handle the metadata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those big genotyping files are
put into HDF5 format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And HDF5 is a no SQL solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fast to be able to get data in
and out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We store in two different directions so we
can extract the data in two different
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole thing is built with extract
performance in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually superior to the systems
I have been working with in industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some benchmarking tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some test data sets,
5,000 samples, 32 million markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this shows different databases that
would benchmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HDF5 is really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even better than some Spark,
Hadoop-based systems that are used for big
[SPEAKER_00]: data analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This works really well for the kind of
data we're handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for extract, this just shows
increasing sizes of data and extracting
[SPEAKER_00]: them at different times in HDF5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also developing tools, most
importantly, a genomic selection pipeline
[SPEAKER_00]: in Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be publicly available soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have open source tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've developed in a tool called FlatJack,
which is a candy bar in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to visualize the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're working with Katie Dart to
be able to do the analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part of this is being able to tie
all these systems together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have genomic statement management
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we tie this with the reading
management system in the analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with Wrappy,
which is a breeding API, a standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: API community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pete Selby, who runs this community,
is based here at Cornell and also at VTI
[SPEAKER_00]: and reports to Kelly Robbins, who's also
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're running this under the
Excellence in Breeding platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new platform that the CG centers
have funded from Bill and Linda Gates to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to consolidate a lot of this
research across the CG centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kelly Robbins is leading module five
in that platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all about community and
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have members of Gobi within each of the
institutes that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of training and cross
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also really strive to work very closely
with neighboring projects in Gobi so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we get the maximum value out of our
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look again at what is needed to
be able to do genomic selection well and
[SPEAKER_00]: how well we are doing in being able to
implement genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the components that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding management, high throughput
sampling and shipping, genotyping
[SPEAKER_00]: platform, data management, high throughput
analysis, and APIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: With micro-assisted selection,
you can get away with just an Excel
[SPEAKER_00]: spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you move to genomic selection,
you really got to have everything in place
[SPEAKER_00]: and connect it to be able to do this well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the state status and industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have invested over many years in all
of these systems, a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that have been built up over
tens of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've pretty much got everything in
place and they're still finding it hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the CG centers, we're
suffering from little bits of money here
[SPEAKER_00]: and there, one project for this system,
one project for another system.
[SPEAKER_00]: CG centers are not all about plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there for the greater good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to be able to support the
local communities and sustain resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant breeding is only just a part of
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have many resources and
those resources are spread across multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: projects with multiple objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, excellence in breeding is trying
to focus these resources to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of three or four different
solutions for breeding management,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to get our ducks in a row for
those systems because coming down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: is a whole new suite of technologies in
terms of data analytics and artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's amazing all of these
companies that are currently active in
[SPEAKER_00]: this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be a lot of venture capital
around to be able to support this many
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very highly saturated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got precision analytics,
so where you're gonna put your hybrid on
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm, understanding your marketplaces,
robotics and drones, sensors, smart
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down here, this is the genetic,
this is the plant breeding space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not so much in the plant
breeding space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fancy setting up your own company,
I would recommend this is the space to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for your AI technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are seeing a lot of new information
coming out about using big data analytics
[SPEAKER_00]: and machine learning to understand
quantitative traits, gene networks,
[SPEAKER_00]: gene complexes, gene communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also seeing a lot of new information
coming out of allele mining technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you look at the diversity of alleles
across your species and try and track them
[SPEAKER_00]: to a particular geographic location or a
particular phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use that also to understand
your traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course now we have CRISPR, where we can
edit the DNA and inject the mutation that
[SPEAKER_00]: we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing multiplexed CRISPR
platforms now where we can do four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: of these mutations in one go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very reliable yet, but I'm sure
it will be soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we can take all of the
information that we get through AI and big
[SPEAKER_00]: data and allele mining and start to plug
it into our CRISPR mutations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's hope I'll just have it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene editing is really gonna change the
landscaping of breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say also, I actually worked in IP
when I was at Pioneer for eight years from
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really gonna change how IP
lawyers can pattern material.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the era of genomics data, there really,
I mean, in genomics and genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: there really wasn't a lot to patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have any unique sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were method patents for the genomic
selection methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plant patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Method patterns are hard to police.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant patterns are only available in the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just see these IP lawyers salivating
over the years to have unique sequences
[SPEAKER_00]: caused by CRISPR with a function that can
be used to patent materials globally and
[SPEAKER_00]: also that are easy to police, because
you've got all those sequences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just see a sequence on every
chromosome arm to protect from germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might make life complicated for
all of us, but will fuel a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment from industry in plant breeding
and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it or not, that is gonna advance
plant breeding and benefits to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of Ed's slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've stolen this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he talks about breeding 1.0
phenotypic selection, controlled traits
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.0 with QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here, genomic selection in 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: This 2.0 is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of technologies
happening in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really gonna change how we do
plant breeding in terms of discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that no matter how many
tools you have to be able to elucidate
[SPEAKER_00]: gene complexes and understand those gene
complexes using all this AI and machine
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, we're still gonna struggle to be
able to move those genes into breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: material to keep up with the parent
selection cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we can have CRISPR technologies
that can instantaneously mutate blinds as
[SPEAKER_00]: they go through that breeding cycle,
or unless those traits are of extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: high value, the value of that continuous
breeding cycle is just not gonna allow
[SPEAKER_00]: those new QTLs in however much we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really think it's gonna be a
combination of these two spaces into the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because biology isn't easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we look at genetics and the more
we look at biology, the more complicated
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can have these new tools and we
can try and delve down into the rabbit
[SPEAKER_00]: hole of that complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, genomic selection is all
about keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's around the state.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kelly asked, how long do we think the
public Suji centers are gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up here?
[SPEAKER_00]: With industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we'll ever catch up with
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have to accept that we just
have to have a working system in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never gonna be to the level that
industry have because we just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: those investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can put a pretty good system in
place and do the genomic selection we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say to turn all of these faces
happy to you at the end of our project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to understand how your SCOBY
project is trying to address the eating
stagnation you mentioned by the Gates
Foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you showed that breeding
programs only a small part of our project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering how or if it is
addressing the eating stagnation problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to address the yield stagnation
problem, but it's certainly not the only
[SPEAKER_00]: component of yield stagnation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen is a huge part of that and
getting fertilizers out to the right
[SPEAKER_00]: places and the right fertilizers and the
right applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another project that the Gates
Foundation is funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also seed purity is a massive issue
for yield losses in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is either counterfeit seed or
it's just the wrong cross was accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very high rate just bad seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by putting in seed purity,
seed quality mechanisms, which we're
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to do through our project too,
that's gonna make huge advances just by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself in improving yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then genomic selection, if you can
make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And micro assistive selection can also
have a component of increased yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, certainly not just genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand that you are developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we're developing the tool here at
Cornell, but we spend a lot of time going
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the CG centers and finding out how
to integrate it into their systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: working with their other systems to be
able to make it a workable model in the CG
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing it to see if it's scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we'll be working on actually
making it smaller and more deployable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, scaling it right now we're
building it, scaling it is the next phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned a lot from an economist and I
hope I'm not the only one in the room,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it looks like it might be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one question about the environment,
because a lot of this breeding happens
[SPEAKER_05]: with keeping climate in soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of, you know, when we think
about technologies being adopted in
[SPEAKER_05]: different countries, and we think about
those transfers of genetic material going
[SPEAKER_05]: from one place to another one,
we don't necessarily control the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment in the other location.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is the environment dealt with in
this system?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope my question makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that clear enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the experiments that we're doing are
within the relevant environments that the
[SPEAKER_00]: material is going to be grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's handled by the plant breeders
in the CG centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand those environments and
where they need to be testing materials
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any environmental variation will
become part of the model for genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, climate change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was like a follow up question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these systems accounting for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is there a way that that can come in
through this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are they too, are they kind of myopic
in that sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: The system right now and the environments
that they are in, but drought tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity tolerance are very important
traits as well that they do testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as predicting for the future
changes in environment, I'm sure modeling
[SPEAKER_00]: could have a role in that space to be able
to incorporate that into future models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's walking out on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an incubation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a general question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said genomic selection is simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it not simple?
[SPEAKER_00]: When is genomic selection not simple?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have the right models?
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to understand gene conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genomic selection can get very messy
if you don't have the right models or the
[SPEAKER_00]: right experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the design of it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have a good design and the good
experimental design, it's very simple to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement as part of the routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could speak a
little bit more about how you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR will affect and be integrated into
the Gobi project if there's less emphasis
[SPEAKER_01]: on understanding gene architecture and the
underlying genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding of CRISPR is that you
would need to really understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequences to be fully utilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR is not going to be part of the Gobi
project, but that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very much focused on genomic
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CRISPR is very much being incorporated
and prioritized in industry breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs because of the patent protection
that it gives them and because it's less
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be regulated than trans genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's going to be huge in this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was part of your talk, and I think I
missed that it was separate from Gobi's
[SPEAKER_01]: focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
