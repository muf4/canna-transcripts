[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you all for inviting me to come
to your seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to be here and interact
with more of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a plant pathologist, but as
Melanie said, a lot of the work that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing is focused on plant pathogens
in interactions with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to be able to come here and
interact with all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work in the lab, in my interest in
general, is fairly broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in the evolutionary ecology
of bacteria interacting with hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I'm interested in how the
bacterial genome content, gene content,
[SPEAKER_00]: connects to interactions with different
hosts or in different environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in particular, this is interesting for
bacteria that interact with multiple hosts
[SPEAKER_00]: or in multiple environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be in different abiotic
environments or bacteria that interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with a host and then also in other abiotic
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as many of you know, Pseudomonas
cernidae is a really good example of that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it does inhabit a lot of different
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's very well studied as a
plant pathogen for good reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very common plant pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pathogen that likely infects
possibly every plant or nearly every plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a serious agricultural pathogen
that can cause serious agricultural losses
[SPEAKER_00]: such as in bacterial speck of tomato or
kiwi canker or different highly virulent
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that infect plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that aspect of the
bacterial ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: cernidae are what we call cernidae is a
very diverse group of strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of which are not very closely
related to each other and can inhabit a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different habitats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be more of what we think of as
an environmental bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be found in leaf litter and in the
water cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be present in lake and rivers
and actually rises up into the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: via evaporation and transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's thought to be a major nucleator
in a biological nucleator in clouds which
[SPEAKER_00]: forms precipitation and then falls back
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be very common in those
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cernidae can also be common on plants
without causing disease either because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on a plant that's not a compatible
host or because it's simply epiphytic on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surfaces of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's in this context where
epiphytic populations of bacteria are on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant surfaces that might be interacting
with plants associated with diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of years before I started my
postdoc work on this, there was one paper
[SPEAKER_00]: showing that some cernidae strains could
actually in fact grow within and then kill
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of adding one additional habitat
to this already kind of impressive list
[SPEAKER_00]: that potentially cernidae could be using
aphids as an additional host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my postdoc work was focused
on these two questions, kind of defining
[SPEAKER_00]: what the effects of the bacteria on the
insect hosts were and also because of my
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in trying to connect genomes to
bacterial ecology to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic basis for these interactions
actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be presenting mostly this work
today and getting in a little bit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction that I'm going now as we're
starting up work here in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just putting this in a broader context and
understanding how these interactions with
[SPEAKER_00]: insects could actually be impacting
bacterial populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the work that I've been doing
has been focusing on connector insects
[SPEAKER_00]: such as aphids and white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are flow of feeding insects so they
insert their straw-like mouthparts into
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and feed our plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also major agricultural pests and
because they can cause a lot of rock
[SPEAKER_00]: damage there's a lot of interest in
finding alternative control strategies
[SPEAKER_00]: such as biological control or bioactive
compounds from different sources that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be able to control them as pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's partly why I've been focusing on
hemipterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mostly talk about P. aphids today but
actually have found fairly similar effects
[SPEAKER_00]: across different hemipteran species which
is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing survival of P. aphids
and white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dashed lines are white flies and
the solid lines are aphids and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: showing a proportion of individuals
surviving over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these individuals have been exposed to
the bacteria in artificial diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see the aphids and the
white flies have pretty similar decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: in survival with both of the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: With B728A you see a very virulent
response where the insects survive over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Survival goes down to almost zero within
just a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Bc3000 survival is significantly
decreased compared to the controls but not
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this to be true not just in P.
aphids and white flies but also in other
[SPEAKER_00]: hemipteran species and other aphid
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the similar highly virulent effect
with highly virulent strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I found fairly broad effects
across other unrelated insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance we did an experiment where
we fed lady beetle larvae with either
[SPEAKER_00]: infected or uninfected aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady beetle survival was
decreased, infected aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their rate of development was slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't quite the same, it wasn't as
virulent as it is for hemipteran insects
[SPEAKER_00]: where they were all dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was definitely an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found an effect in a lepidopteran
larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a chewing herbivore that was eating
food that had natural numbers of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: in it where the survival of the larva was
decreased and development time wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like there could be fairly
broad effects of syringae across different
[SPEAKER_00]: insects although that probably varies
depending on what the insect is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only insect that I actually haven't
been able to find an effect for is blue
[SPEAKER_00]: flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drosophila melanogaster don't care if you
feed tons of syringae to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The syringae doesn't grow and flies
through just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly all of these insects of
course are things that would actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: encumbering syringae on leaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that you see some kind of
significant effect is potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact it might be a fairly broad
pattern across other plant-associated
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that we just haven't found yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have actually been four plant
pathogens that have been found to also be
[SPEAKER_00]: key agent pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other three have very similar
effects to what we see with syringae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that these
plant-associated bacteria are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: common pathogens to insects but we don't
really have a handle on how frequent these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads into this broader question of
how environmental bacteria actually impact
[SPEAKER_00]: nectar and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mostly insects like aphids are studied
for their intercellular symbionts which we
[SPEAKER_00]: know are an incredibly important part for
the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have fairly limited microbial
communities other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take an aphid, sort of sterilize
it and then use culture-dependent or
[SPEAKER_00]: culture-independent means to see what kind
of bacteria they have in their gut,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't find very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find like a few taxa, a few cells,
typically things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-associated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people tend to think that that is
because they're feeding on plumb,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just not very much bacteria there,
and these, like, having a gut community
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't something that's important for the
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have also been few known bacterial
pathogens found other than the ones that I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not entirely clear if that is
because this is an actual pattern that
[SPEAKER_00]: these environmental bacteria aren't
interacting with insects that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's maybe an observation bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the aphids get infected by
syringae, they don't have any obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of fungal pathogens in
aphids and you can see when aphids get
[SPEAKER_00]: infected with fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungus grows out of the aphid and it's
really obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see anything when they die from
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have killed it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also potentially hard to find the
infection in nature because the aphids are
[SPEAKER_00]: dying so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to kind of catch, in order to
sample an aphid that would be infected,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to catch it before the bacteria
go too much and the aphid dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may actually be hard to find if
people haven't done specifically looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of get a sense of how frequent
these interactions might be, we have done
[SPEAKER_00]: some work in the lab, in particular
looking at the infectivity of syringae to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many cells does an aphid need to
pick up in order to become infected?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was an experiment done by Kelly
Clark, who was an undergraduate at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this experiment, we used E728A,
so we used a highly virulent strain so it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be sure to get a strong effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the infection in artificial
diets to control exactly how many bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: the aphids were being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we exposed them to varying doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used second and third and star aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are aphids that are still
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not reproductive yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that they aren't the
marketing that added variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we infected them for 24 hours,
and then we tracked them for an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: five days, put them on sterile diets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they've been infected, and they're
just on a diet with sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tracked their survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end, we tested to make sure that we
knew exactly what the bacterial dose was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tested the diet that they'd been
feeding on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also took a proportion of some of
the individuals and sampled them for
[SPEAKER_00]: infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out what proportion were actually
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was replicated three times with
30 to 40 events in each treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: in each room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of deadly things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out that mortality is
dose-dependent, which is kind of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher doses lead to higher mortality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the probability of survival and
overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the likelihood of infection also
increased with the bacterial dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So higher doses, and this is the log of
the bacterial dose, led to a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of infected individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the higher infection likelihood led to
decreased survival, significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: decreased survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that the mortality is
actually correlated with the chance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: likelihood of infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than, it's not the number of
cells that you're picking up that matters,
[SPEAKER_00]: but whether you become infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you become infected, you will probably
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it seems that you can become
infected with a very low number of cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the proportion surviving
again over the proportion infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each point is a different dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we calculated the number of cells that
these infants likely ingested based on how
[SPEAKER_00]: much they were feeding and what the dose
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blue line is the control survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all doses that didn't
significantly alter the survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red dots are all doses that
significantly decreased survival of the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these two cases, these two doses,
the infants were likely only ingesting one
[SPEAKER_00]: to nine cells, but yet had significant
decreased survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually in keeping with what
was found in another system, in Dikia,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they used different methods to
figure out what the minimum effective dose
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also found it to be about 10
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the agents that get infected believe
in a small number of bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: those can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is definitely in
keeping with the number of cells that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to find on a leaf, which kind
of puts this in more of an ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: context, suggesting that this would be
something that's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also done experiments on plants
testing the same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the plants themselves were
sprayed with different types of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the aphids were introduced onto
the plants that had been infected on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the time, we counted the
survival of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the time, we quantified the
number of bacteria that were on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when populations were at 10 to the 4 or
10 to the 6 polyformin units per leaflet,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is on the follow-up plants,
there was significantly decreased survival
[SPEAKER_00]: of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so these are population numbers
that you could actually find on leaves in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was done in a greenhouse,
but it's certainly something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could imagine happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, and in fact, we see infection
rates on plants with about 10 to 30% of
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids becoming infected depending on the
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's somewhat a significant effect
here, where a lot of the aphids are
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially getting infected, suggesting
that this could be common in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that raises the question of if there
are these highly virulent pathogens out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that they're encountering
frequently, what are the aphids doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: defend themselves against this infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done anything with aphid
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids are thought to have a reduced
immunity compared to a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lower number of immune
function genes in their genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of pathogens, they don't
really know as much of a immune system
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what we expect to find based
on other systems like the saffola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of thought that aphids maybe
don't respond immunologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thought that maybe they have more
varied non-immunological defenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we've mostly focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one possibility is symbiont-mediated
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So intracellular symbionts can be
defensive against pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help the insects survive a
pathogen infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found some evidence for that,
actually, in white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another possibility that we were
interested in is fecundity compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fecundity compensation is when there's
a reproductive response to an infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in theory, individuals can invest in
reproduction over investing in immunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that might be favored when a pathogen
is highly virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not going to survive an
infection, there will be no point in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to fight it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you should invest less of your
resources in just reproducing as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can before you die, particularly if
you are an organism that reproduces a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids are asexual and have really high
reproductive abilities, and maybe it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense for them to be able to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fecundity compensation is a good way to
invest in defense in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to test this, we set up an experiment
similar to the one with E728A that we
[SPEAKER_00]: described before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except this time we used DC3000 because
it's a lower virulent strain, so it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't kill the insects as quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could actually follow them long
enough to wash them and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the insects were infected in
artificial diet using different titers of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except after they were infected,
we put them on plants so they could kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of be happy, as happy as an infected aphid
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tracked their survival,
development time, and reproductive rate
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to give you the answer
to what happens to survival and
[SPEAKER_00]: development time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For survival, it was dose dependent,
as we saw with the other strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with higher doses more aphids died.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no effect on development time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reached adulthood equally fast if
they were infected or if there was a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did see an interesting effect on
reproductive rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing the number of offspring
per aphid per day and bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration along the bacterial
concentration on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each point is a different replicate,
the name of the replicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had three replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the control verses for all of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all clustered up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly similar in reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extremely high doses are over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly those aphids died before they got a
chance to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why those numbers are so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the remaining points,
you see a significant positive
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually a decrease in
reproductive rate with the very low doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then an increase in reproductive rate
with high doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these rates are actually higher than
the control rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests that maybe there is some
kind of cost to infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be lowering their reproductive
ability here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But possibly they're then increasing that
reproductive rate to cover the infection
[SPEAKER_00]: at or the cost of the infection as they go
up as the dose goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at that, when you look
at the means of the reproductive rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you kind of break the doses down into
low, medium, high, you can see that a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these reproductive rates are
actually significantly different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the increase with the dose
and also the fact that the low dose
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has a significantly different
reproductive rate than the high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely something different
happening with this low dose than with the
[SPEAKER_00]: high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's particularly striking when you
look at the survival of the aphids at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the percent number of aphids
that are surviving on day seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the point when all of the aphids
have started reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these high doses, there's less than 20%
of the aphids actually surviving,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're really reproducing at a rate
that's higher than the controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that the mechanism here might be
that those aphids that were exposed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: high dose, so the black circles,
are reproducing faster than the other
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here there's a peak of reproduction
actually at day six after infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that starts to go down,
whereas the control aphids, the open
[SPEAKER_00]: circles, are just kind of starting to ramp
up reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be kind of increasing the
timing of that reproduction to counter the
[SPEAKER_00]: infection once it starts to get bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is some suggestion that aphids may
actually be reacting to virulent infection
[SPEAKER_00]: with prenatal compensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have been exploring another
potential defense, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: avoidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are these strains out there
that are highly virulent, it would make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that the aphids, or insects in
general, would evolve to avoid them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was work that was actually done by
an REU student in the lab here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel Faye, an REU student for the
microbial forensic flow programs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited about how well this
worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel was able to do three different
experiments looking at how syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced avid feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the first experiment, she looked at
feeding rates on artificial diet with or
[SPEAKER_00]: without different bacterial strains in our
control and no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, the aphids were in a
setup where all they had access to was a
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding sachet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it either was in control or had
bacterial suspensions in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they either had a choice to feed or
not feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she followed them for 24 hours,
checking every few hours to see how many
[SPEAKER_00]: were feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a separate experiment, she looked at
feeding preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this setup, the aphids were given
three different choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually in a 96-well plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each well could be a different choice
in bacterial strain or control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the aphids were free to roam around
and go wherever they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she looked again at how many aphids
were feeding over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, what we're most interested
in is whether this actually works on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also did an experiment where they
were given a choice of feeding their own
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they were given a choice of
feeding on leaves that had bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is being done on fava plants,
which are actually really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nice setup for that,
because as the leaves kind of unfurl,
[SPEAKER_00]: each leaf is composed of two leaflets that
are about the same size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we painted one leaflet with epiphytic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other, we painted with a control
and let those dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we introduced aphids onto the
plant and let them make their choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we counted them over the course of
several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did find an effect of B728A on the
aphid feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the proportion of aphids in
each cup that are feeding either on
[SPEAKER_00]: control diet, diet with B728A,
or diet with DC3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control of DC3000 were the same,
depending on the number of aphids feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but B728A was significantly less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that in the control,
we see pretty much all of the aphids are
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding at any given time, whereas with
B728A, only about 30 to 40% would be
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding at any given observation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this holds up when you actually give
them a choice between different treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in here, there was less feeding on
DC3000 compared to the control,
[SPEAKER_00]: although it wasn't significantly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was almost no feeding at all on
areas that have B728A.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might notice that there's kind of a
lower, there's definitely a lower rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding overall here compared to what I
just showed you, where almost all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, only about 40% were feeding at any
given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be a difference just in the
experimental setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were in a different container that
was bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might also be because this had more
spaces that didn't actually have food,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so they had to move around and search
for places that did have food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may have just had less time than
they were able to spend feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might actually be an effect of them
being able to experience both the control
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, if they found the spot
initially that had bacteria in it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't want to feed there,
they might move on and try to find other
[SPEAKER_00]: places and just again spend more time
moving around, less time feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of this experiment,
we also wanted to confirm that these
[SPEAKER_00]: results looked right by testing to see if
they became effective from that feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a low rate of infection by
DC3000, which matches what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Rachel didn't find any aphids
that were infected with DC728A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that our ability to detect a
very low infection if there were just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few cells in the aphid is pretty limited
because we grind it up and plate it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if there were just a couple of cells,
we could miss those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's striking in that it
matches these results really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also suggests that maybe the aphids
are actually actively avoiding the
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent strain, because it's not clear to
me necessarily if they might become
[SPEAKER_00]: infected with DC728A really quickly and
then stop feeding because they're infected
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of unhealthy, or if they
encounter DC728A and they try to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: that food altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to show the results of our
plant experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only done this once, so I'm not
saying that I believe it necessarily at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, but it is in keeping with what
we have found in that the aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were at least twice as many aphids
feeding on leaves without bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to leaves with bacteria,
and this is over the course of several
[SPEAKER_00]: days, so these numbers are fairly
consistent, which makes sense that aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really move around very much once
they settle, but it seems that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: making some kind of choice initially,
and there's a significant difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're suggesting, in keeping with this
idea, that there are broad and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent effects on the insects,
the fact that micturine insects die very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly from this infection, and you find
effects on other insects as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also we're finding that there might be
effects on more complicated insect
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors, such as reproduction or feeding
behavior, and things that we care about
[SPEAKER_00]: because also those affect plants,
and I'd like to be able to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: exploring these ideas a bit more and
getting a better sense on what exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: those effects are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also interested in being able to
figure out what the genomic basis of these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this question has been looked at in
syringe for insect virulence in a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the initial work that paper initially
came out, Saverny-Zilal had done assays
[SPEAKER_00]: with transposon mutants, so they had
screened a number of transposon mutants to
[SPEAKER_00]: look for attenuated virulence,
and they weren't able to find something
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a virulence factor that seemed to
have a significant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they did find that knocking out
swarming motility in syringe impacted
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence, so it might be important in
some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also tried some targeted knocking
out of genes that look like they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: insect toxins, so syringe has homologs of
genes that are known insect toxins from
[SPEAKER_00]: photoraptors, and knocking those out has
no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also, I just started kind of screening
all of the genes that I could get my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on that were mostly used for regulators of
plant virulence, and found to have no
[SPEAKER_00]: effect there either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you'll see in a second,
there doesn't seem to be a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between virulence in plants, virulence in
insects, so it's something different
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in those two cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, because these approaches weren't
really working, I tried a different way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, using the fact that there
are a large number of sequences of syringe
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes, and a lot of phenotypic variation
between strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to do a genome-wide association
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea here is that you would have
strains with sequence genomes that vary in
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that have high virulence,
and some that have low virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take all of their protein sequences,
and cluster those into cogs, into clusters
[SPEAKER_00]: of homologous groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look to see what cogs are present
in each strain, and how that correlates
[SPEAKER_00]: with their virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would do a correlation between the
strain phenotype and the space virulence,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the abundance of genes in a cog that
each strain has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna present the results of this
work today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat preliminary in that I only
have 12 strains that I've included,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's kind of a proof of concept that
this is something you can do, and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully I'll be able to expand on more
strains and get a better idea of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to screen the strains,
we screened 14 strains that had sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes, and actually screened them in
white flies for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these strains are a pretty broad swath
across the syringe gene of our phylogeny,
[SPEAKER_00]: including, I think, some strains that are
no longer classified as syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a lot of
phylogenetic breadth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna show you virulence data for
all of these strains, just so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense of how that varies across strains,
but I actually only included strains in
[SPEAKER_00]: the analysis, for which I have three
replica assays for virulence, so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have a very good idea of exactly how
virulent the strains are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, it varies quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most virulent strains are,
of course, B728A, which we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: before, and actually two strains that
aren't plant pathogens, TL2 and C7,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's why I think that virulence of
insects isn't necessarily related to
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This group of strains in general tends to
be more virulent, whereas a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: strains would be less virulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say that virulence here,
I'm measuring it as the time that it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: for the bacteria to significantly decrease
survival compared to controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much all of the strains will,
in fact, eventually kill the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of differs is how quickly
that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just one measure of virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total number of dead at different
times or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried looking at virulence and
measuring it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you get kind of the same results
regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just like this, maybe I think,
is using more easily paired across
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this data, taking all of the
strains for which I had good virulence
[SPEAKER_00]: data for, I clustered the protein
sequences using ortho MCL and then did a
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation of the number of genes in each
cog with the virulence of a given strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this data here is identified
candidate genes that are correlated with
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence either because they're present
in highly virulent strains and absent in
[SPEAKER_00]: low virulent strains, or they might be
more copies in high virulent strains than
[SPEAKER_00]: they are in low virulent strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is some example patterns
that you see for some of the most highly
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated cogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the number of copies of a cog
across the strain going down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: columns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see cases where highly virulent
strains like set 7 might have multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: copies of a gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of cases where the low virulent
strains of course have no copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you actually look to see what
those genes are, the list of candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, unfortunately a large number of
more hypothetical proteins are unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really say very much about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one regulatory gene,
a transcription regulator that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting if that's changing
transcription across strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a chemotaxis gene, a signal
transaction protein that I was interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in because the sense of motility
potentially is important for virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of other genes that we
know their function but it's not entirely
[SPEAKER_00]: clear how that might be related to
virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, these are genes that are
correlated with virulence in this
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, but it doesn't mean that they're
actually causing virulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is likely, I haven't controlled for
the cryogenetic signal here, so these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains are more closely related and of
course more virulence and also tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: have similar genes in that array.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there might be an effect there that
certainly needs to be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course some of these genes can be
present in these virulent phytotaxin for
[SPEAKER_00]: other reasons not related to the insect at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, a lot of the strains that
are highly virulent, especially these that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in group two, are more commonly
epiphytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a little bit better, it's thought
that they do a little bit better in the
[SPEAKER_00]: epiphytic habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is intriguing because it means that
they're more likely to encounter the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also might just be a coincidence
that whatever makes you a bit epiphyte may
[SPEAKER_00]: also make you virulent to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to be able to get at that
question of is this just a coincidence or
[SPEAKER_00]: are these strains actually adaptive for
being virulent to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this fits in my larger question of
understanding how these insect
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions impact surrounding
populations and asking if they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from the insects at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting something out of using
insects as a host?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this actually a dead end for them,
especially if the strains that are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: virulent and they're killing their host
within a few days, is that something that
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits them at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And theoretically it could.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the bacteria grow to really
high numbers inside the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is data from white flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these white flies were infected for 24
hours and then taken off the diet and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed the bacteria to grow inside the
insects up to fairly high numbers for both
[SPEAKER_00]: strains at a similar rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some more, you actually get higher
numbers in case the insects are bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than white flies, I guess, so you get more
growth in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 10 to the 6th to 10 to the 8th cells
per aphid, which is kind of huge given the
[SPEAKER_00]: size of aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that those bacteria can be
excreted in aphid honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeydew is kind of a picturesque word of
saying aphid waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemipterid insects are feeding out
crates out and they excrete all that extra
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar in this kind of really sugar-rich
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And infected aphids can secrete a large
number of bacteria in the honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stavronidis had all found that infected
aphids could put up to 10 to the 7th cfd
[SPEAKER_00]: per square centimeter of bacteria on a
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hypothesized that that could be
important for the bacteria in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: building up their population sizes while
also dispersing to other hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear to me if that's necessarily
the case because it might be good
[SPEAKER_00]: initially to be in honeydew because you're
in this like sugar source, but as that
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew starts to dry out on the leaf and
the osmolarity changes, you're then in
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially a really bad environment for a
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to look at this, we were interested in
looking at the serendipity persistence in
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took infected aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected their honeydew over the
course of 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, we quantified the number
of bacteria that were excreted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: honeydew for some samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the other samples, we took them
and we incubated them in different
[SPEAKER_00]: communities for an additional 24 hours and
then quantified the bacteria again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing the change in bacterial
population of cfd per aphid after that
[SPEAKER_00]: incubation compared to what the initial
numbers were in honeydew as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just persistence in honeydew
without any additional input from the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the full change is on a log scale
because there's a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero would be no change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers are about the same as the
initial worth populations stay the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And minus one would be all the bacteria
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that at 50 and 75% of the
community, the bacteria don't tend to do
[SPEAKER_00]: very well in the honeydew actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not until you get up to 99% of
the community that you actually see some
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at very high communities, potentially
honeydew might be a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may also be differences between the
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: B728A had a higher mean than B728A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there's a lot of overlap here,
and I don't know if that would hold up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's kind of reinforcing this
question of whether interacting with
[SPEAKER_00]: insects is actually beneficial for cfd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to do better if their
aphids are on plant and there's honeydew
[SPEAKER_00]: being laid down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that actually a bad environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up an experiment where we sprayed
absolutely populations of B728A on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we introduced aphids onto plants,
or organ aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let the aphids be on the plant for a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, we sampled epiphytic
bacteria on the plants and modified
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the results of one
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a bit preliminary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, the bacterial numbers
were higher at all communities when aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very high community, it was
actually significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 50% and 75% community, there was
overlap in the ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fair amount of variation in the
population size from leaf to leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, the means are quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a log scale, so there's a high
amount of difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear to me if this difference is
necessarily because the bacteria were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the aphids, and therefore,
their numbers were increasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if maybe they are deriving some benefit
from the honeydew on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I showed you before indicated that
they were only really getting any benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: at the high community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that that honeydew on the
leaves is necessarily helping with that
[SPEAKER_00]: much of these lower communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be redoing this experiment
with more samples to see if that holds up
[SPEAKER_00]: or if we can get a better sense of how
different these actually are when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids present or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer that question, do the
bacteria actually benefit from having the
[SPEAKER_00]: insects present?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is sometimes, depending upon
the environmental conditions, or possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: on the specific strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to keep working on using
experiments to really understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions are, what the
environmental abiotic conditions are,
[SPEAKER_00]: or how the strains react to this
attraction, and how the insects are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually impacting the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all together, kind of looking at both
sides of this, both the insect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial side, we're getting a sense that
there can be very complex dynamics of how
[SPEAKER_00]: syringe interacts not only with plants,
which of course we know, but also with
[SPEAKER_00]: other members of the ecological community,
with insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have direct impacts on the survival of
aphids, indirect impacts on the survival
[SPEAKER_00]: of other birds to aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that syringe can apparently impact
aphid feeding, and aphid reproduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which of course would have an influence on
plants as it changes the aphid
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, we're hoping to get a
better sense of how the aphid also impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: the bacterial population, to kind of
understand what those effects are when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're being planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ideally, I'd like to be able to
connect what we learned about these
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological interactions to the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just looking at insect virulence,
but hoping to find the genetic basis for
[SPEAKER_00]: other traits, such as aphid avoidance,
of what are the aphids actually picking up
[SPEAKER_00]: on the bacteria that they're avoiding,
if they are avoiding them, or what
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial traits are necessary for
success, either in growth inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid, or for success on habitats when
aphids are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the directions that
the lab is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to briefly thank some people
at my previous Crestock Labs at University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Arizona at Berkeley, and then at the
new lab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been
[SPEAKER_00]: a production of Cornell University,
on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
