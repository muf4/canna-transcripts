[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Meg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Olenka.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are Cornell University students from
the Mineral Nutrition Course, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: here to tell you about copper nutrition in
people and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper is a transition metal and one of
the elements in the periodic table.
[SPEAKER_01]: All life on Earth needs copper to survive,
including us humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use copper as a cofactor in many
proteins called cuproenzymes, where copper
[SPEAKER_00]: atoms help polypeptide chains of amino
acids react with other metals in our
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies, like iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper and its proteins have important
roles throughout our bodies, including
[SPEAKER_00]: brain function, immune function,
and red blood cell production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because copper is such an important
nutrient, there are severe health effects
[SPEAKER_01]: if we are deficient in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Children born without sufficient copper
during their mother's pregnancies have
[SPEAKER_01]: issues with bone formation and with their
cardiovascular system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also can have abnormalities with
brain and immune system function for the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults with copper deficiency,
meanwhile, have cardiovascular problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: including those concerning cholesterol,
blood sugar, and irregular heartbeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can have neurological and
behavioral problems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean we can't have too much
copper, however.
[SPEAKER_01]: The metal is toxic at high levels because
it can make reactive oxygen species from
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen molecules that can tear apart
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the mitochondria, the
powerhouses of the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, most people's bodies do a good
job of controlling the amount of copper in
[SPEAKER_01]: our cells, so this is not usually an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What our bodies can't control is how much
copper we have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all essential nutrients, we have to
eat regular supply of copper to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main sources from which humans
acquire nutrients is plants, who in turn
[SPEAKER_00]: take up nutrients from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants, like all other living things,
need copper, and it's important for the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, development, and fertility of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It plays an important role in
photosynthesis, reactive oxygen species
[SPEAKER_00]: detoxification, hormone perception,
and cell wall formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: While humans are free to make changes in
their diet, plants are restricted by the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment they grow in and the
availability of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost 30% of farmland across the globe is
made of neutral or basic pH soils that are
[SPEAKER_01]: considered to be copper-deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs that a plant has copper deficiency
include a slow growth rate, the yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: of young leaves, an inability to form
wood, a lack of flowers, and few seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning plants like wheat and rice might
not produce enough grains for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, just like in humans, copper can
also be toxic if it is accumulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms of toxicity are yellowing of
mature leaves, slow root growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the production of reactive oxygen
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to keep the copper levels at the
range that are best for them, plants
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly regulate all the processes that
take up and redistribute copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uptake of copper into plants is done by
copper transporter proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these are in the CDR copped family
and are important for taking up copper
[SPEAKER_01]: from the soil into the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since free copper is not a safe form to
keep in living cells, it has to be bound
[SPEAKER_01]: to molecules called ligands or chaperones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once in the plant, copper needs to be
taken from the root cells to the xylem,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it can be carried throughout the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loading copper into the xylem cells
requires a transporter protein from the
[SPEAKER_00]: HMA family.
[SPEAKER_00]: After moving through the xylem,
copper is delivered to leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and fruit by the YSL and CTR
copped transporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these proteins are regulated by
different proteins called transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that determine which other genes
in the plant's DNA can be transcribed and
[SPEAKER_00]: translated into proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main transcription factors that
control copper levels are SPL7 and CITF1.
[SPEAKER_01]: They regulate all of the transporters we
described to make sure enough copper is
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if the amounts of copper in soil
are not high enough, another strategy can
[SPEAKER_01]: be activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is called copper economy mode and it
redistributes copper from less needed
[SPEAKER_01]: areas and processes towards the most
important ones, such as photosynthesis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot that goes into controlling
copper in plants, whether taking it up
[SPEAKER_00]: from soil or carrying it from one part of
the plant to another, but we hope we have
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced you why it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're a big fan of eating liver,
odds are most of your copper comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants like wheat or corn, and that copper
is critical for so many parts of your own
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plants feed healthy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope you have enjoyed this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
See you next time.
