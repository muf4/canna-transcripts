[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the introduction and the
chance to be here and share some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research that we've been doing for many
years and ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had tried to suggest that one of my
doctoral students, Ritwik Bosch,
[SPEAKER_00]: give this talk, but Janice really wanted
to have me do it, and so Ritwik is
[SPEAKER_00]: represented in spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Wisconsin, my doctorate and also the
master's at Virginia was very much focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural production and externalities and
problems, specifically water quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: other ecological implications of
contemporary farming practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became very interested in
agri-environmental policy, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: federal elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Ritwik.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm bill and the conservation
elements of the farm bill, and I followed
[SPEAKER_00]: that closely for 20, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to talk about is a half-full,
glass half-empty story.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the potential to bring more science
and more data and more modeling to bear on
[SPEAKER_00]: how we do conservation and the
opportunities to use a more data-rich
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to inform how we spend money in
agri-environmental programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: More generally, how conservation is
advanced, whether it's funded by private
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, whether it's funded by public
dollars, or whether it's funded by
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntary investments by farmers and
ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the half-full side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The half-empty side is to look at the
history and the politics of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in this country, but
certainly Europe wouldn't be very
[SPEAKER_00]: different, in which the commitments to
conservation are mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, there are strong
commitments throughout agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: among consumers in the general public and
bureaucrats and elected officials to
[SPEAKER_00]: stewardship and conservation and
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, we have bedrock
commitments to cheap food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these things are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're left with, well, which flavor is
going to come out in a given decision or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a given moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big picture that I want to try
to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The talk, and I will explain each of these
terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had told me they shared the title
with a friend, and they said, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what any of these words mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservation, not just in North America
and the Midwest, there's one slide there
[SPEAKER_00]: from India, not just traditional
conservation practices like buffer strips,
[SPEAKER_00]: contour plowing, conservation tillage,
integrated pest management, but also next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of the leadership group for this
Cornell Institute for Digital Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on the cusp of being launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in futuristic visions of
agriculture, food, and conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a conservative
backwards-looking talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also hopefully a forward-looking
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity and I think the upside,
the exciting element with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: ecology is to advance the
cost-effectiveness of conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have one dollar, if you only
have one conservation, if you only have
[SPEAKER_00]: one conservation contract to give,
what should you do with that dollar or
[SPEAKER_00]: that conservation contract?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we use data, could we characterize
distributions of landscapes, of farming
[SPEAKER_00]: systems to capture that variance and use
it in a way that informs investment
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions and the way we structure
contracts with farmers to do conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: under cost-sharing arrangements?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have variability in farmers'
willingness to participate in the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of money they want to be paid,
we call that willingness to accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have variability in landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have variability in conservation
practices, the width of the buffer strip,
[SPEAKER_00]: the architecture of the buffer strip,
the way the buffer strip is installed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way the buffer strip is maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are parameters that
matter in terms of the cost-effectiveness,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the cost of creating, maintaining
a conservation practice, the opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: cost, perhaps in terms of loss of arable
land and crop yield, and the benefits in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of local and regional ecosystem
services.
[SPEAKER_00]: On-farm conservation benefits might be
soil erosion control, off-farm
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation benefits might be addressing
hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promise is using data, using knowledge
about spatial distributions and economic
[SPEAKER_00]: distributions to spend and target
conservation dollars effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also can imagine assessing conservation
programs rigorously in a data-rich
[SPEAKER_00]: environment to breed more
cost-effectiveness and better outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I said, it's a kind of glass
half full, glass half empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, we're confronted with
great opportunities to bring data to bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The types of science you folks are doing
in terms of models and empirical analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: can inform and should be informing
conservation practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sense is it's not informing it as
deeply and as fast as it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that historical friction that
constrains we introduce new ideas,
[SPEAKER_00]: new practices, and new data into
conservation planning and administration
[SPEAKER_00]: of conservation programs, that's the
historical friction I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the one hand, there's new energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's new sense of agriculture's
relationship with environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is driving demand for farming
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: For renegotiating the social contract with
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For putting a candle under Congress so
they invest differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly for USDA and natural resource
conservation services.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that's fine, but on the other hand,
the world was not created yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck with a history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck with organizational culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stuck with a variety of
relationships that are represented in what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call policy coalitions or policy
networks and the way that trade groups and
[SPEAKER_00]: farm groups and environmental groups and
political interests are articulated and
[SPEAKER_00]: come to agree on agri-environmental policy
in the past conditions what opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: exist for renegotiating agri-environmental
policy in the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So history matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promised you definitions of each of the
terms in the title and there you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does it mean to say I'm excited
about a data-driven or an outcome-based
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to agri-environmental policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: It immediately means that we don't live in
such a world today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that agri-environmental policy is
relatively data-poor right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really data-driven and it's not
outcome-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's exciting is the idea that people
are going to bring models about input and
[SPEAKER_00]: output relationships and how variants in
weather, slope, soil type, cropping
[SPEAKER_00]: system, nutrient management planning and
practice map onto water quality outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally agri-environmental policy
has been premised on paying farmers for
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Install a buffer strip, change your
rotation, use split application of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are proxies for outcomes of interest
like improved water quality, enhanced
[SPEAKER_00]: biosecurity, biodiversity, reductions in
greenhouse gas, emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's some problem and
dissatisfaction from relying on proxies
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that taxpayers and
administrators and elected officials would
[SPEAKER_00]: be increasingly comfortable and it's
attractive to them to be able to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about an outcome-based approach to policy,
evidence-based approach to policy where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually say something and provide
some evidence about the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between inputs which are dollars and
outcomes which are security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well-being as opposed to relying on how
many people came to your extension
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting, how many booklets did you
distribute, how many farm meeting days did
[SPEAKER_00]: you host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all outputs but they're not
outcomes and so moving to an outcome-based
[SPEAKER_00]: approach is a kind of new grammar of
policy and this is part of this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: data-driven excitement and bringing
science to bear in a more effective way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agri-environmental policy is the portfolio
in this country largely of federally
[SPEAKER_00]: funded conservation practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could also and I'll talk a
little bit of time allows about private
[SPEAKER_00]: standards in the role of supermarkets
particularly in advancing in
[SPEAKER_00]: agri-environmental commitments on land
schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Critical analysis, this is a social
scientific term to explicitly signal that
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to question the assumptions and the
knowledge that are embedded in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of framing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because a problem is expressed in a
certain way in popular imaginations or
[SPEAKER_00]: even in scientific communities,
it doesn't mean that's the only way or
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to express them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always want to reflexively go back
and ask are we asking the right question
[SPEAKER_00]: or whose question is being asked and whose
question is being ignored and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment to critical analysis and I hope
that will come through today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This issue of institutional change,
institutions are the kind of social
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure by which behavior,
decisions, relationships develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the structure by which government,
markets, and communities function.
[SPEAKER_00]: By being interested in institutional
change, I'm interested in the shifts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the social relationships and commitments
and ideas that structure resource
[SPEAKER_00]: allocation and behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm interested in
institutional change associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: agri-environmental policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we do it differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: What mediates changes in how we do the
payments of farmers and how we elicit
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation practices on the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's basically a theory of
everything and on the one hand that means
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be interesting but it might not
hold water, I agree with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still want to share it with you as a
work in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm particularly interested in this piece
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that we're constantly
assessing things, asking questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: the world we live in and we're taking
actions and those are kind of recursively
[SPEAKER_00]: related to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take action, we reflect on it,
people reflect on our actions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes through some cycle of evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a group of actors, organizations,
networks or fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're developing new capabilities and
new competencies to take new actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those actions represent new practices
which reconstitute the organizations and
[SPEAKER_00]: the population of organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, let's say farms or fields,
they change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That change in farming practice and farms
creates different outputs, economic,
[SPEAKER_00]: social and ecological and the cycle
renews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we evaluate things, we make judgments
about accountability that puts pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations like land-grant universities
and farms which create new capabilities
[SPEAKER_00]: for a new round of action, which creates
innovation or not, which reconfigures the
[SPEAKER_00]: field perhaps to create a new round of
outcomes which might be important
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement, it might be degradation,
it depends what lands and criteria you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dynamics associated with this theory
of everything, on the one hand I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: simplest one is organizational ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we see changes in fields, farms,
cropping systems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some selection pressure by which
we see change in the population of actors
[SPEAKER_00]: and is there some kind of accountability
or legitimacy test that creates actionable
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure and selection which changes the
character of the field of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds new competencies, let's say to
reduce nitrous oxide emissions or reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus emissions or enhance
biodiversity through agricultural practice
[SPEAKER_00]: and how does that change outcomes of
interest like greenhouse gas emissions,
[SPEAKER_00]: water quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity on the lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a theory of everything, let's not
tackle it in this 45 minutes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in the question of
do we have an accountability crisis and is
[SPEAKER_00]: that driving something in
agri-environmental policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So agri-environmental policy was created
in a particular historical context.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agricultural policy that I recognize
in the United States and also in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe in general came out of the farm
crisis of the mid 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had chronic low commodity prices and we
had tremendous shakeout in the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family farms were disappearing radically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress in this country stepped in in
many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way they stepped in was by providing
payments to farmers for conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dollars were spent to protect soil,
protect water, protect wetlands but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think equally if not more importantly
those dollars were spent to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and rural communities,
to put a floor under farmers incomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce commodity and to boost commodity
prices by reducing supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by putting controls on land and taking
land out of production we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce supply, increase price and put a
floor under farmers income.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that was bundled together under
farm legislation and bundled together
[SPEAKER_00]: under agri-environmental payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say that agri-environmental
payments are not cost effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't designed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those payments made to farmers were
multifunctional and so when we say we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting as much environmental benefit
per dollar spent, the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me by surprise, took me about 20
years to figure that out but here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them environmental programs and
they are environmental programs but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not and living with that paradox
is not easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principles by which agri-environmental
payments are structured in this country
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll stick with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very strong commitment to
volunteerism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that all the time with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: National Resource Conservation Service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our agri-environmental programs are
voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have cross compliance but by and large
they're voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We rely on standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a tremendous amount of
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite regimented and there's
tremendous solidarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solidarity among farmers and even more so
solidarity between USDA and farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a commitment not to put farmers in
a position of being subject to discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA has long taken a position that
they're not willing to police farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be a resource for the
agricultural community and be an agent of
[SPEAKER_00]: technical change and be a booster of
agriculture, not a cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea that all of a sudden we're going
to flip into something like payment for
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem services and we're going to use
data and we're going to use accountability
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to rely on evidence-based,
outcome-based approaches to deciding if
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers will get paid and how much they
get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My argument is that all of those
commitments don't fit easily with
[SPEAKER_00]: historical commitments to relying on
standards, not outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relying on competition, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's rely on solidarity and to rely
really on financial incentives strictly as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to voluntary commitments to
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This historical basis for conservation
doesn't sit neatly with this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: future vision of relying on market-based,
data-driven approaches and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: tension that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critique of agri-environmental policy
has been poorly focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not a new critique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 30-year-old critique at minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Conservation Reserve Program was
first created in 1985, the program
[SPEAKER_00]: basically was organized on first-come,
first-serve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no scoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no EBI environmental benefits
index.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically you walked in and said,
I want to lease the government my crop
[SPEAKER_00]: land for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't measure environmental
benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really even look at rental
payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, data administrative techniques
have been introduced to ratchet up the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of data and the kind of rational
logic behind conservation programs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's more room for increased
reliance on data and a more rational,
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive approach to soliciting
farmers' involvement in conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggested that I'm interested in this
idea of accountability crisis or
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimacy driving institutional change in
agri-environmental policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to offer, I think, three quotes
that highlight the fact that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a new debate, and two,
it's an active debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have heard of the SEAP
program, the Conservation Affects
[SPEAKER_00]: Assessment Program?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad, Ritvik, you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in your dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 15-year-old program out of USDA,
and it's a massive interagency program to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluate the state of the science
underlying conservation in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a very ambitious program.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, it's a strictly
performative program in that USDA is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically saying don't criticize us for
not having the scientific capability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation well and do it efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just spent 15 years doing data
synthesis and coming up with standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've got it under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This concern about the effects and the
effectiveness of conservation arises from
[SPEAKER_00]: critiques of USDA that come from outside
of the government and critiques from
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Government Accounting Office reports
that the USDA does not have adequate
[SPEAKER_00]: processes in place to optimize
environmental performance associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation spending, and that they have
very weak administrative controls on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they spend taxpayer money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an ongoing effort to
highlight and put pressure on Congress and
[SPEAKER_00]: on USDA and Natural Resource Conservation
Service to up their game and to bring new
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and new rationality to bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This month, there's a new piece of
legislation introduced to Congress called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Agricultural Data Act, and in the
context of the Cornell Digital Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, this is some significance,
but it creates a possibility, and
[SPEAKER_00]: land-grant researchers are the specific
beneficiaries in the legislation to get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to field and farm level records of
conservation and agronomic practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this would be revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you have tried to get access to
farm management data, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you go through FOIA or you end up
doing individual surveys, whether we view
[SPEAKER_00]: this as an opening of the door to have
more data and more access to data,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you could read it the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this quite carefully,
what's actually being talked about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: competitiveness and the economic
performance of farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do mention soil health, but you don't
see here a commitment to opening up,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, all of the data that will be
relevant to analyze water quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my point is simply to emphasize that
this conversation about data, creating
[SPEAKER_00]: data, capturing data, creating access to
data, using data, is an active
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The critique of USDA, the critique of
agriculture, broadly defined in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental performance, is an old
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's lots of reasons to think
that agriculture is coming under
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing scrutiny and that there's
increasing pressure on Congress,
[SPEAKER_00]: on USDA, and on farmers to invest
differently in conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's some of these points.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have persistent environmental problems,
whether it's greenhouse gas emissions and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrous oxide, whether it's Gulf of Mexico
hypoxia, wetland loss, soil erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all continue to be significant
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can argue about how effectively they've
been abated, but they certainly have not
[SPEAKER_00]: been limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new modeling capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new sensing capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have new capacity to use warehouse
synthesized data for computer science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a general appetite for
moving to outcome-based and evidence-based
[SPEAKER_00]: policy, and I think there's a general
appetite for exposing actors inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucracy, and in this case,
farmers, to new discipline, this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tools and the thinking of what's
called new public management or
[SPEAKER_00]: neoliberalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those ideas about using market
logic, using a kind of value for money
[SPEAKER_00]: test, all seems to have kind of currency
in a contemporary environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think the time is ripe to bring more
data and more accountability to bear on
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers with respect to agri-environmental
policy, and also similarly, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, but also the way USDA spends that
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: My argument is that I think there is
pressure on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I showed you that theory of
everything, and the arrow to the top right
[SPEAKER_00]: showed this legitimacy and accountability
push that puts pressure to start the cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: towards new competencies and changes in
practices and initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of innovation that leads
to different socio-ecological outcomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I put this with a question mark
because I got my PhD in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture and agri-environmental policy
has been in crisis for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a new crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're always in crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity, I said the glass is half
full, half empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity here is to model on a
site-specific basis inputs and outputs to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the relationship between
farming practices, local environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, and conservation
interventions, and how those yield
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and, of course, yield costs,
and by using data and striving to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: results to maximize conservation benefits
under budget constraint, we could make
[SPEAKER_00]: taxpayer dollars go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could enhance the environment and,
in theory, not create dips in farm income
[SPEAKER_00]: or spikes in cost of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we can achieve that win-win,
that's not particularly important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nonetheless, we could make an analysis
that would allow us to intervene in
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation in a way that's more surgical
and precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that we haven't picked up these
$10 bills off the floor, the reason that
[SPEAKER_00]: we already haven't harnessed the power of
data and models to drive conservation and
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve something like precision
conservation, I want to argue we can make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of through three bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specification problems, estimation
problems, and the historical problem of
[SPEAKER_00]: political economic relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about the specification
problems, it becomes clear that
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture is a big industry,
very heterogeneous conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of different kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we said we're going to increase the
cost effectiveness of conservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would say, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean surface water or groundwater?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean wetlands, or do you mean
greenhouse gases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean soil erosion, or do you mean
farm workers' health?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of different things that
could be optimized and lots of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we could invest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This problem of specification is quite
messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make commensurate and
comparable these different types of social
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities and aspirations?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is you don't really do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economists might say that they have
techniques, or philosophers might say they
[SPEAKER_00]: have techniques, but it's pretty messy
business when you try to get people to
[SPEAKER_00]: agree on what are the benefits streams
you're most interested in and how would
[SPEAKER_00]: you value those benefits streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would a conservation benefit in suburban
New York, 40 miles from New York City?
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of that conservation because of
the density of the population would make
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation in South Dakota impossible if
you did it on a dollar basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the willingness to pay of those
consumers and the number of consumers is
[SPEAKER_00]: so high, you tried to rationalize that
spending on some economic calculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be stuck with a very messy problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the spending would be in urban
metropolitan areas and deep rural areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of using data, using economics
to specify where to invest and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: invest is not straightforward and it opens
up lots of ethical, philosophical,
[SPEAKER_00]: legal, and political questions.
Estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Estimating costs and benefits of
conservation is non-trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume many of you do this for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not what I do for a living,
but whenever I look at it, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The models, the scale of those models,
the data requirements of those models make
[SPEAKER_00]: it tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The costs of those models, the transaction
costs of moving to a data rich environment
[SPEAKER_00]: are non-trivial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more data we have to collect,
the more data we have to make sense of,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends and we can argue about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only do you have to estimate the
benefits of a conservation practice,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in order to do that, you have to have
a baseline or a counterfactual scenario
[SPEAKER_00]: against which to compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, you'd have to collect data
before you make a conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention, then you have to collect
data after you make the conservation
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention, then you have to
parameterize the weather that particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: happened during that growing season or
that week and make sense of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that is costly and difficult and
we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenges of estimating economic and
ecological performance of conservation in
[SPEAKER_00]: site-specific environments are non-trivial
and this very much impedes this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: movement or this flip of institutional
change into a data rich outcome-based
[SPEAKER_00]: agri-environmental policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one, a political economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of you, I think in high school,
at least if you were, when U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: high schools were familiar with the iron
triangle where interest groups develop
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with bureaucrats which lead
to a regulatory failure, institutional
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically have a situation in which
Congress is not interested in imposing
[SPEAKER_00]: greater discipline on USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not interested in imposing greater
discipline on farmers and I think we could
[SPEAKER_00]: say the same thing for USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want to be the policemen of
agriculture and it's not going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them with their mission, not going to help
them politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their organizational culture, it's kind of
boots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily want to be in the
basement with models crunching numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd rather be out in their pickup truck
having conversations with farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to build relationships that yield
positive outcomes for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the most important thing to
recognize is that historically there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great ambivalence about imposing
discipline on farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how we've come to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you imagine we're going to use
data, use economics, use models,
[SPEAKER_00]: use satellites, use drones to figure out
how conservation should be organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to impose that knowledge on
the landscape through farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the opportunity is to use science,
new politics, and new thinking to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more cost-effective approaches to
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It constraints our specification,
estimation, and political economic
[SPEAKER_00]: relations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it doesn't mean that we're stuck,
although I think maybe it does mean we're
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck, but I think that there are
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to close in a minute and I want
to hear from you about where you think
[SPEAKER_00]: this could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the smart money is on more of the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the smart money is,
where we're kind of we're locked into this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to recognize,
you know, that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Bill, we've bundled together
agricultural policy and food assistance
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 80% of spending in the Farm Bill is
food assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this means that urban states are
invested in the Farm Bill, not just rural
[SPEAKER_00]: states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a kind of mutual
non-aggression treaty between Iowa and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, Iowa and Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're not going to spit on your shoes
and you're not going to spit on my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a very clever way to do
agricultural policy in a big and diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to saying, let's ratchet
up the data on farmers and let's get some
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation, people aren't particularly
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more of the same is in the cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, the cost of sensors is
dropping radically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what's happening with
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential to use secondary data and
aerial photographs and satellites and
[SPEAKER_00]: drones, so these other ways to do sensing
both in field, in plant tissue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also remotely creates all types of new
opportunities that can drive down the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolutions in artificial intelligence and
data synthesis and architecture of
[SPEAKER_00]: computing creates all types of
opportunities to do useful things with
[SPEAKER_00]: that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're going to have a data
revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold your breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Private standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because Congress won't act doesn't
mean Walmart won't act.
[SPEAKER_00]: The private standards over the last 20
years have become very, very important in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, not just in the United
States, but around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large, powerful retailers are promoting,
in some case, dictating farming practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide use, selection of varieties,
irrigation standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scheduling in a variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that value chains and
relationships farmers have with retail or
[SPEAKER_00]: food processors could lead to a more data
rich, a more rational, and a more
[SPEAKER_00]: accountable, and a more kind of
disciplinary environment in which
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation is practiced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this idea of payment for
ecosystem services, how many of you have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of PES?
[SPEAKER_00]: Payment for Ecosystem Services.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of using this logic would fit
quite neatly under a private scheme of
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing production with farmers and
incentivizing them to engage in
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the political coalitions that
gave rise to agricultural policy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980s could be reconfigured and recreated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened once.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should not be so myopic to
think that we only lived through the only
[SPEAKER_00]: history.
[SPEAKER_00]: History is being created every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be new history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been waiting for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that we're going to reach
some type of nitrogen cascade or some type
[SPEAKER_00]: of Greenland ice shelf melting that will
flip us into a new reality with a new
[SPEAKER_00]: politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a particularly rosy future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we wanted to see how could
agri-environmental change, agri-mental
[SPEAKER_00]: policy change, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A more optimistic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written that I'm quite interested in
the idea that farmers come clean and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, it's a dirty industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are going to take ownership of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want regulatory forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want the support of the land-grant
universities to farm differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of denying the problems of
environment, own them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which would be a complete flip from how
Farm Bureau Federation and commodity
[SPEAKER_00]: groups currently function.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variety out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by and large, I don't think
agriculture, production agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been particularly engaged and
progressive when it comes to ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mostly have been denying and shunting
off blame to urban populations and what
[SPEAKER_00]: have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are possibilities that
could shake up this kind of stickiness
[SPEAKER_00]: that we find ourselves in.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, new capabilities and data
being created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're finding their way in unevenly
into policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, there's lots of reasons
we don't see a data revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming to a close.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we reflect on institutional change,
and we reflect on this theory of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, is it possible that crisis of
legitimacy and accountability can create a
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic of progress, of learning,
of enriching administration and practice
[SPEAKER_00]: through bringing data to bear?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying this a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'll continue to study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the fact that the number of farms,
the percentage of the population engaged
[SPEAKER_00]: in agriculture drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic significance of agriculture
drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasingly in urban society.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all these reasons, people have said
that agriculture's political power will
[SPEAKER_00]: wane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture still remains a very potent
political block for historical,
[SPEAKER_00]: cognitive and cultural reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's interesting to think about
can the government accounting office put a
[SPEAKER_00]: candle under Congress and under USDA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the state fix itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it civil society, social movements
and science that could somehow catalyze a
[SPEAKER_00]: change in agri-environmental policy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are open questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this last one, I think is a bit
abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think when we look at the seat,
and we look at critiques of knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, and at the way science and data
are implicated in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA, like all bureaucracies and
agriculture, like all sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: are very adept at co-opting criticism and
deflecting criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA took this critique of the
knowledge base underlying conservation and
[SPEAKER_00]: turned it into a victory party.
[SPEAKER_00]: A celebration of how much they knew and
how forward looking they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a glass half full perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways, these sectors are so
politically entrenched that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change does happen, but it's slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I close.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you view legitimacy and credibility as
synonymous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legitimacy and credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, we talk about legitimacy as
conformance with sets of norms and
[SPEAKER_00]: practices that are commensurate or
compatible with cognitive and legal
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a kind of conformance problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the practice, is the behavior map on
to some standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Credibility, I guess, is more about
accuracy or validity, which might be
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to a more technical assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legitimacy is not really subject to a
technical assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it kind of feel right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it resonate with you as being kosher?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a kind of qualitative
assessment of legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Credibility, I don't know, I guess I'm
thinking a more technocratic approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluating credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: the legitimacy, you know, fitting into
existing structures, that certainly does
[SPEAKER_04]: sound right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You almost always have to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really thought it through too
well, but that does sound right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Credibility is just, can you, you know,
do you believe the results of the study?
[SPEAKER_04]: Having said all that, I feel like they're
kind of synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The credibility, I mean, yeah,
the trust will become credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're linked, yeah, they're linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I think that my point is that
if the credibility of USDA, the
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility of conservation practice,
the credibility of conservation science,
[SPEAKER_00]: if all of that stuff is brought into
question, then it will have lost its
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimacy or its legitimacy will be
tarnished, which creates an opening for
[SPEAKER_00]: something new, not necessarily something
better, but something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So credibility, what I think would be an
important element of legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, instead of chronicling or
watching history unfold, are we having a
[SPEAKER_02]: unique opportunity now to make history
here at an academic institution?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm aware about the credibility
loss or the particular view by a large
[SPEAKER_02]: proportion of this country's society
towards academia, but still, we're sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit outside of a lot of the
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can play and we can demonstrate,
and you mentioned data-driven evidence,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the revolution in sensing technology
these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can just show what there is,
what is possible, I would think that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are, that ought to catch on to turn the
tide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a little bit worried about the
double standards, that there are some
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental externalities that I'm a
little bit more familiar with,
[SPEAKER_02]: such as carbon trading or payments for
carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_02]: emission reductions, where there is
already the absolute need for data.
You have to really show that you sequester
carbon.
Or reduce the emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the landscape, that is also metered
through remote sensing or in-field
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements, sometimes through practices,
but more often through evidence of actual
[SPEAKER_02]: reductions of sequestration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not this, I mean, why do they think
they can live outside our society in just
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, okay, I do it, give me 200 bucks
per acre, and never check it, never check
[SPEAKER_02]: it, and actually achieve what it's
supposed to achieve?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't work in any other sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, I think that the idea that
scientists and the scientific community
[SPEAKER_00]: can create new tools and provide evidence,
which then is taken up through some
[SPEAKER_00]: magical process by legislators and by
practitioners, has some validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some reason to believe that
there's some kind of linear process by
[SPEAKER_00]: which good ideas and proven technologies
find their way, even if there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: political fence or there's ignorance or
there's bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So history shows that good ideas can find
their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I think we see lots of
situations where political and economic
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints require that we don't rely on
this kind of passive approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we have to be in the fray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Cornell's engaged initiative is
very much about saying we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: research in a way that is in relation with
communities and practitioners and the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public, and not rely on this
passive approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do the science, we'll burp up
good ideas, and they'll find their way out
[SPEAKER_00]: there into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be more strategic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned companies, that's
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do enjoy great privilege to be
isolated from a lot of pressures and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole analysis could be used for
citation evaluations for your productivity
[SPEAKER_00]: and your impact assessment reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're all on the verge of being
subject to discipline and data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wish it on the farmers if you
don't wish it on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third point is, I think it is
remarkable that farmers enjoy such a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory vacuum and forgiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're largely unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could say KFOs are regulated,
the Clean Water Act, pesticide labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture's got it good and they know
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your second point was important to me,
but I forgot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ritvick and I have a paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The revisions were due yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to share this with you because
our paper shows that the science and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rigor associated with creating measures of
additionality, real value created,
[SPEAKER_00]: so some difference according to a
baseline, are constructed in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: resembles sausage making.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that joke about policy making and
being sausage making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, all of these approaches to
measurement involve, on the one hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: rigor and empiricism, and the other hand,
slup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't want to characterize some
of them as the gold standard and
[SPEAKER_00]: bulletproof and that science, and this is
just folk wisdom and they're making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can find validity and
credibility in folk practice and grounded
[SPEAKER_00]: practice, and we can find nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In what is called science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send you this paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's on nitrous oxide and the CARS
nitrous oxide protocol for doing offset
[SPEAKER_00]: payments in corn production based on the
Kellogg Biological Field Stations data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions or comments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, that was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your constraints to making progress,
there was the specification estimation.
I broke them down into two categories.
The first was to say the problem is hard,
and the second is to say we don't have the
will to address the problem.
I don't know if you agree with that
categorization, but that second part is
hierarchically more important than the
first part.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, if we had the will to
address the problem, and maybe Cornell
[SPEAKER_03]: does have the will with the initiative for
data and agriculture to address the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, but USDA and government in
general maybe is not terribly into
[SPEAKER_03]: rational allocation of resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more into rewarding friends and
ideological allies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you do in the face of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're asking the right questions,
and I do think that if we had political
[SPEAKER_00]: commitments, that the technical problems
would, they wouldn't take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, but those are a question of
are we doing the right things versus doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first are we doing the right things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a political and a cultural
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, and I had deep ambivalence
about this whole future, putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: screws to farmers, equipping the Natural
Resource Conservation Service with
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive data from remote sensing
platforms and integrative tools to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what everyone had for breakfast and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a particularly rosy future,
so we can find ourselves in a very dark
[SPEAKER_00]: place with this kind of data-rich future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all seen Black Mirror?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we don't want to go
overboard, and we need to keep in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we're all excited, or not all,
but if I'm excited about bringing data to
[SPEAKER_00]: bear to create value for taxpayers and
introduce discipline to the way we pay
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to do conservation, yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we have to have some caution,
some respect, and some modesty about where
[SPEAKER_00]: this could take us in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree we have a political problem,
but the solution, I think, is not to go
[SPEAKER_00]: around and say, you guys are troglodytes,
and you're not using data and data rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're all going to be technocrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you wouldn't want to go there
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's kind of a delicate issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say the first one,
specification, is not a hard problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wicked problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question of do we value wetlands more
than greenhouse gases, more than
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater, more than phosphorus,
more than nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would we sort that out except through
a political process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a hard problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a values problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is hard, but it's not technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking you might benefit by
looking at other countries but I live in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Netherlands most of the time,
and that's got a much longer history of
[SPEAKER_01]: using science directly in policy and has
led to regulation and the confrontational
[SPEAKER_01]: approach with the farmers that we
typically say of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use nitrate models specifically to
regulate amounts of newer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's phosphate regulations recently
very strongly strengthened for water
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very different society,
but I was just thinking if you compare
[SPEAKER_01]: different countries and then how the
institute, because you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: how the institutions, the different
ministries, for example, in that case have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed, that would be an interesting
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very much interested across
comparative, across sectors and across
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in how institutions are
configured and how they change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that Europe and the Netherlands
is not totally absolved of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's still a lot of
corporatism and it's consensus based,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just science based.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say the politics are,
my wife and daughter, they're Finnish
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Finland, the happiest country
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have a really clean politics
and they have a really rich and educated
[SPEAKER_00]: citizenry and they in their forest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same problems we have by and large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have very high trust in public
institutions, very well educated people,
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of money for the state and they
still suffer from some of these same
[SPEAKER_00]: things I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always better in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
