[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really glad to be here,
a little bit of a step down campus from my
[SPEAKER_02]: previous home and natural resources and
across campus from the lab of ornithology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be talking a little bit
about work I've done in both places over
[SPEAKER_02]: the past eight to 10 years or so,
largely focused on keeping an eye towards
[SPEAKER_02]: effective and intentional design of
collaborative research endeavors that
[SPEAKER_02]: engage both scientists and members of the
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to start out, I really just want to
illustrate this with a story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a story of one of the
scientists I interviewed as part of my
[SPEAKER_02]: dissertation research.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name is Jay Nichols.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a researcher based at the California
Academy of Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he began researching the severely
endangered black sea turtle as an
[SPEAKER_02]: undergraduate and graduate student in the
1980s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, the turtle's decline
was really severe in part due to
[SPEAKER_02]: overfishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where Jay was doing his research in
Mexico, turtle fishing had actually just
[SPEAKER_02]: been declared illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was really basic research that
was needed on the turtles into where they
[SPEAKER_02]: were, how many were left, what threats
were facing them, what they were eating,
[SPEAKER_02]: where they might be found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did find success in answering those
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in doing so, he reflected to me as
part of my dissertation work that the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that you collect data, and I'm quoting him
here, and then use those data to manage a
[SPEAKER_02]: species at risk or an ecosystem at risk
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, he went on to say, I was realizing
that that's certainly not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just not enough, but the
connection between the science and the
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation action is pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, something else needed to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for Jay, that something else began
through partnering with fishermen,
[SPEAKER_02]: with those very people in communities who
by the fate of a changing law could be
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to as turtle poachers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were turtle hunters in
communities in Baja who had boats,
[SPEAKER_02]: who knew how and where to find the
turtles, and whose cultural heritage and
[SPEAKER_02]: identity were really linked to those
turtle populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some could say to their survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these partnerships that Jay began to
build with the communities, with these
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals, grew into a network over a
course of a number of years, a network
[SPEAKER_02]: called Grupo Tortugero, which now conducts
regular monthly monitoring of turtle
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these monitoring initiatives carried
out by local communities now form the
[SPEAKER_02]: basis of scientific data that
collaborating scientists can access and
[SPEAKER_02]: have used to publish papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've used to leverage those data into
conservation action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And communities have begun hosting sea
turtle festivals and educational events
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of this together has precipitated
changes in harvesting and management
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and the gradual recovery of the
sea turtle populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really difficult to draw a causal
connection between the work that Jay has
[SPEAKER_02]: done with these communities and with these
individuals and the slow start of a
[SPEAKER_02]: recovery of these turtle populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nonetheless, something has happened
here that has caused a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the work that I've been involved in
over the past eight to 10 years at the Lab
[SPEAKER_02]: of Ornithology has been looking at what
potentials there are for change through
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships with the public towards
conservation among other potential
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes and what those elements and
drivers of change might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things that have been
complicating looking into this is that
[SPEAKER_02]: these initiatives that involve the public
in scientific research have happened in
[SPEAKER_02]: many different ways in many different
places and growing out of traditions that
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't had much of a conversation with
one another about how this work might be
[SPEAKER_02]: done and done well and done intentionally
to achieve desired results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to look at what's successful about
these partnerships sort of requires
[SPEAKER_02]: defining a space and defining a landscape
of what it is that we want to investigate
[SPEAKER_02]: and then what's shared about those things
and where we also might identify critical
[SPEAKER_02]: differences that can help us understand
how these partnerships work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to talk for a second about
terminology just very briefly because in
[SPEAKER_02]: the opening and in the title of this talk,
it was proposed that the term to describe
[SPEAKER_02]: these partnerships is public participation
in scientific research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a term that I was part of a
group that coined a number of years back
[SPEAKER_02]: to acknowledge that although the Lab of
Ornithology does something called citizen
[SPEAKER_02]: science, there was also research happening
in context where it's called volunteer
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring, Pro-Am partnerships,
community-based forestry that all shared
[SPEAKER_02]: similar characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, even though we coined that term
public participation in scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: research, you're gonna hear me today
default to using the term citizen science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is largely because the community
has come around to sharing an appreciation
[SPEAKER_02]: for this term.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are clearly some critiques that we
could make of this term and how it's used,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the term has now found its way even
into the Oxford English Dictionary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while I think it can be pedantic to
share a dictionary definition of a term in
[SPEAKER_02]: an academic talk, I'm putting it up here
not so much because I'm using that
[SPEAKER_02]: definition, but because it's actually in
the dictionary, which is a huge step in
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that this is a thing that exists,
a phenomenon that's worthy of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually a decent definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientific work undertaken by members of
the public often, not always often,
[SPEAKER_02]: in collaboration with or under the
direction of professional scientists and
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so citizen science.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it good for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When done well, citizen science can give
scientists access to data that are
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise unfeasible to collect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can result in significant new
scientific insights, such as the landscape
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, insights into bird population
trends that are modeled here through data
[SPEAKER_02]: collected and shared by amateur bird
observers through the Lab of Ornithology's
[SPEAKER_02]: eBird project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So citizen science is about data
collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But citizen science by its very nature is
also about experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it results in experiences for the
observers that are taking part in that
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a photo of Sherman's Creek,
a watershed in South Central Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_02]: where residents in the 1990s began
collecting baseline water quality data in
[SPEAKER_02]: the watershed in response to planned
development that threatened this resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was a community that already knew
this watershed intimately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ran through their backyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ran through their communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But through partnerships with scientists
at Dickinson College, they, and through
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of data collection,
they came to know that resource also
[SPEAKER_02]: scientifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they used those experiences and those
data to successfully ban the proposed
[SPEAKER_02]: power plant in their neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So citizen science has a lot of potential
to affect quite a few different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And taken together, the opportunity to
impact both science and learning seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer powerful possibilities for
conservation action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, back in 2009, when at the Lab
of Ornithology, we did a quick survey of
[SPEAKER_02]: practitioners of citizen science,
people who are running and managing
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen science projects, and asked them
what their goals were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that they were really pretty
evenly split between goals for science,
[SPEAKER_02]: goals for education and outreach,
and goals for, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation, stewardship, or changing
behavior, somehow making an impact on the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that achieving any one of
these goals, any one of these results
[SPEAKER_02]: through citizen science or through science
itself, requires really careful and
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional work and planning for any
given project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we reflect for just a moment on the
turtle research example that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: from Jay Nichols, I'd like to suggest that
Jay's success may be due in a large part
[SPEAKER_02]: because he recognizes that conservation
and conservation action doesn't just look
[SPEAKER_02]: and feel like this, like going out and
observing the turtles, but conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: action is really a socially embedded
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether we want to save the world or a
single species, no matter how rigorous or
[SPEAKER_02]: compelling the research itself,
no matter how impactful the learning for
[SPEAKER_02]: the individuals who take part,
that science and that learning is embedded
[SPEAKER_02]: and surrounded by a social context of
people and values and budgets and
[SPEAKER_02]: priorities that also influences decisions
when it comes to conservation and change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So citizen science may be, and we suggest
can be, a powerful tool in these settings
[SPEAKER_02]: because it can engage both the scientific
and the social aspects of conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how can we make sure that we think
carefully about how to do both of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things well, both the social engagements
and the science?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is coming back to research that I
started with colleagues at the Lab of
[SPEAKER_02]: Ornithology and a number of other
different institutions back in 2009,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2010, recognizing that many practitioners
had goals that fell into three categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are articulated slightly differently
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But three categories related to outcomes
for science, outcomes for individuals,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can say learning here, and outcomes for
social ecological systems, conservation
[SPEAKER_02]: stewardship behaviors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started looking at the way
participation might be handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this research started in the context
of informal science education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was an eye particularly towards
the outcomes for individuals here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but recognizing that all of these other
things also fell into there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through research that was funded by
the Center for the Advancement of Informal
[SPEAKER_02]: Science Education, we looked at a number
of case studies of National Science
[SPEAKER_02]: Foundation funded citizen science projects
to try and relate participation and
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how that public participation
in scientific research might influence all
[SPEAKER_02]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through that work and some work that
I'll talk about in a moment, we came to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand that that participation,
around that participation, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: important to understand two aspects,
both the degree of public participation in
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of research and also the
quality of that participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me start with degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So degree is a fairly simple concept,
a question of who participates and in what
[SPEAKER_02]: or the depth of public involvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the research process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so through the case report for NSF,
we set up a rubric assuming, if we will,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to accept that the research
process of doing science involves all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people can argue that you can
articulate this in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the purposes of this research,
we know that science starts with defining
[SPEAKER_02]: a question or an issue, gathering
information, developing explanations,
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting data, analyzing data,
interpreting results and asking new
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally, scientists conduct this
whole process themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at times, the public can be invited to
engage in different steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the projects that the lab of
ornithology runs, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: involve the public at this level,
collecting samples or in the case of
[SPEAKER_02]: birds, making observations and sharing
those observations with scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some cases out there where
individuals can engage in a project in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more of a deeper way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, even in some cases where
they're engaged in the entire research
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sherman's Creek example that I
mentioned earlier, the community was
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitated by researchers at Dickinson
College in defining their own question and
[SPEAKER_02]: the protocols and all the ways through
interpreting the data and using those data
[SPEAKER_02]: to make change in their communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the case report, we propose the
terms for these styles, these approaches
[SPEAKER_02]: to participation as contributory,
collaborative and co-created.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't concern yourselves with those
terms terribly much except that I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to use them in the graph that follows to
illustrate the kinds of outcomes that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were starting to see associated with each
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have to say that data on the
outcomes of these partnerships are really
[SPEAKER_02]: limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of research that's been
done, particularly into the learning
[SPEAKER_02]: outcomes, let alone the conservation
outcomes of citizen science projects,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly any that can draw clear
causal connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those data that are available really
were starting to suggest to us that those
[SPEAKER_02]: contributory projects, those where
participants were involved at the level of
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting data through a protocol
designed by scientists, where scientists
[SPEAKER_02]: were using and analyzing those data to
answer a scientific question, were really
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly well-suited, as one might
expect, to be providing data for good,
[SPEAKER_02]: rigorous, peer-reviewed publications.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those that seem to be having the
greatest impact on public learning and on
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation action fell more in this
category.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's not to say that these other
outcomes didn't happen through these other
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches to participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that it may be more difficult or
fewer data were available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this was largely coming from
research that was focused on understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: the informal science education outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it came out at a time that several
other publications were appearing with
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar typologies of participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Finn Danielson out of the
Monitoring Matters Network in Copenhagen
[SPEAKER_02]: articulated very similar categories of
participation using different terms and
[SPEAKER_02]: reviewed over 100 participatory monitoring
research initiatives around the globe and
[SPEAKER_02]: came up with very similar results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those where the public were largely
involved in collecting data yielded
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective for precise and accurate data.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, decision-making was slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was lower potential for influencing
the capacity of, he was looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders in the decision-making
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the flip side on the co-created style
of engagement with higher potential for
[SPEAKER_02]: prompt decision-making and stakeholder
capacities, however, expectations for data
[SPEAKER_02]: precision and accuracy might be a little
bit lower depending on how that was
[SPEAKER_02]: handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Importantly, however, Danielson and
colleagues pointed out that this was an
[SPEAKER_02]: area where you had to think not just about
the degree of public participation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also about the quality of
participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while the degree of participation
is fairly easy to quantify, quality is
[SPEAKER_02]: more subjective and context relevant,
having to do with things along the lines
[SPEAKER_02]: of trust and fairness and credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Danielson and others and some of my
work published in Ecology and Society
[SPEAKER_02]: draws on participation theory where
there's a real rich and deep literature
[SPEAKER_02]: that looks at assumptions which would be
easy to make looking at the implications
[SPEAKER_02]: of the degree of participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really challenges assumptions that more
participation is better participation and
[SPEAKER_02]: really forces the question of asking whose
interests are being served and to what
[SPEAKER_02]: end, and also how those interests are
balanced in the design of a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to give you two brief
examples where you can think there might
[SPEAKER_02]: be some disparity between the degree of
participation and the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I'm going to call on our eBird
project again where the data collection
[SPEAKER_02]: happens at such a large geographic scale
that it would seem to minimize project
[SPEAKER_02]: leaders' ability to impact the experiences
of the volunteers in any meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can in fact be difficult to do
when the geographic scale is so huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The project approach that makes the most
sense is that contributory approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask a lot of people to share a little
bit of data and it all adds up and makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about the experience and the
quality of participation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just as one example, I want to
harken back to the early days of eBird
[SPEAKER_02]: when participation in the project itself
was really sort of stumbling along in the
[SPEAKER_02]: early 2000s, the first few years of the
project, where even though we had
[SPEAKER_02]: leveraged the support of a high profile
marketer to get the word out about eBird
[SPEAKER_02]: in all the right journals to tell people
to share their brains with science,
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute your data and help make a
difference to scientific researchers at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cornell Lab of Ornithology,
nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in about 2006 with the launch of what
at that time was called eBird 2.0,
[SPEAKER_02]: a critical shift was made in the way the
project was rolled out and talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: with a recognition that the birders who
were out there making those high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: observations, they didn't really care what
the scientists were going to do with those
[SPEAKER_02]: data, but they loved a place where they
could archive their life lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we started marketing eBird as a
service, once we considered the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: the participation for those volunteers,
what they would get out of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: why they would want to take part,
observations and contributions really
[SPEAKER_02]: skyrocketed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as another example, another really
quick example of a project that
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately has folded in the past
number of years, in Canada there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: nationwide set of protocols that really
asked people to make basic observations of
[SPEAKER_02]: something of interest, plants,
ice out, frogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then engage the local communities in
different areas in asking questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: what they were concerned about in their
environment, in their communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And invited them to use some of these
protocols to help address those concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot that could be talked
about here, but I want to point out that
[SPEAKER_02]: what I found most compelling, one of the
things that I found most compelling about
[SPEAKER_02]: this project at the time when they were
publishing was that where most projects in
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: were focused on data quality, high
precision, accurate data, and could
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen science do this, they were asking,
this project was asking, are those data
[SPEAKER_02]: timely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they accessible to the people who need
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they relevant in the communities where
they can make a difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: And are they ultimately useful?
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we start a conversation about
these kinds of qualities with the people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are engaged in citizen science and
public participation in scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: research to better understand the kinds of
data and the kinds of experiences and the
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of participation that can make a
difference when it comes to conservation?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just briefly, I'm going to show you a
common framework that we've articulated
[SPEAKER_02]: for the design of citizen science
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to belabor this,
but I do want to point out that a common
[SPEAKER_02]: logic model can help us think about how
and why we design projects to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: particular outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that through citizen science,
what we're suggesting right now is that it
[SPEAKER_02]: really demands a consideration of both
scientific interest and public interest at
[SPEAKER_02]: the outset in identifying the question or
issue to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that this kind of conversation will
influence how the research protocols and
[SPEAKER_02]: trainings are developed and the kinds of
experiences that are had by volunteers as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as the kinds of observations that
they're going to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have already talked about how that
can yield a wide range of different kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through this framework, we can start
to better understand how those inputs can
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's where I want to focus in a
little bit more on conservation itself as
[SPEAKER_02]: a concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is because in the field of
conservation, there's more focused
[SPEAKER_02]: attention in the past number of years on
conservation evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we know that we're achieving the
desired goals for conservation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Margulis and colleagues in that field
have really started to push people to more
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly identify conservation targets and
articulate when you say you want to affect
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation, what is it very specifically
that you want to change?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you think you're going to get
there through the work that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're asking people to articulate
both conservation targets and pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's a really loose example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can say that through citizen science,
we're going to collect data that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to influence science and that somehow
that's going to affect conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know we need to do better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are the theories that we have
around how citizen science, very
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically how citizen science might be
making a difference for particular
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation targets?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's where I want to share a little
snapshot of some of the research I've done
[SPEAKER_02]: through my dissertation research,
where I've talked to scientists about the
[SPEAKER_02]: work that they've done in projects that
they've committed their careers to in many
[SPEAKER_02]: cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is difficult work,
engaging the public really is not easy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what significance and potential
might scientists be seeing that would
[SPEAKER_02]: really influence their commitment to
citizen science, to weather their
[SPEAKER_02]: critiques and pursue this difficult work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned that I talked to scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did in-depth narrative interviews with
nine individuals who were, in many cases,
[SPEAKER_02]: high-profile scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terry Root is a Nobel Laureate for her
work with the IPCC on climate change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them in a lot of different
ways why it was that they were doing what
[SPEAKER_02]: they were doing and how it was that their
citizen science worked and what it was
[SPEAKER_02]: that they were affecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to get into the details here,
but what I heard from them were many
[SPEAKER_02]: different conservation targets,
a wide diversity of conservation targets,
[SPEAKER_02]: that fell into categories for science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they were doing this because they
needed the science, they needed the data,
[SPEAKER_02]: but because they also saw potentials for
changing the experiences of individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: and because they saw potentials for
changing conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so drawing on the work of Margulis et
al to identify conservation targets and
[SPEAKER_02]: also identify pathways to those targets,
I worked with the narratives of these
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists to start to look at how their
experiences were suggesting that their
[SPEAKER_02]: work could affect their desired
conservation outcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I do want to point out that I'm not
suggesting that this is actually how it
[SPEAKER_02]: works, but how they saw it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more research that needs to
be done to see if these pathways are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to share just two of them with
you, and it's these two that I've circled
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is from Jay Nichols, who I mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I'll just share a quote from his
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, following the excerpt that I
shared earlier, you can't just create the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and hand it off and just expect
action from the authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here he's talking about management
agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they just don't have the capacity
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we keep expecting them to take the
reports and the data and turn it into
[SPEAKER_02]: action, it's kind of a ridiculous dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a bit of a dream all along.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty clear to people that
the way it's going to work is for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to use this knowledge themselves and
create movement or action or change or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is that they're after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what Jay saw as the potential
for citizen science, in part because of a
[SPEAKER_02]: practical theory that was telling him that
the data and the management agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't going to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pathway that he articulated
related to citizen science was this,
[SPEAKER_02]: that community members, by being involved
in data collection, were creating
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge that they themselves had access
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that by defining goals related to that
knowledge for sea turtle protection,
[SPEAKER_02]: they would take knowledge based on that
science to create change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I did mention that I can't say that
this is actually the way it's happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I can say that it's not unfounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay's work has resulted in communities
making change in marine protected areas
[SPEAKER_02]: where they are residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's reason to really consider
that this level of engagement can result
[SPEAKER_02]: in actual use of knowledge, use of
science, and science based action for
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to share another pathway to
illustrate a different kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is from Bill McShea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill's a landscape ecologist based at the
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute
[SPEAKER_02]: in Northern Virginia, where he's done work
to understand mammal populations and their
[SPEAKER_02]: influence on grasslands throughout
Northern Virginia, and in other ecosystems
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Northern Virginia, he said to me,
if you really want to do conservation on
[SPEAKER_02]: that ecosystem, you've got to be working
with private landowners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember this is Northern Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the landscape in that area that's
grassland is held by private individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went on to say, and they're antsy about
government people and official workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to be much more receptive to
citizens, to the general public,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the birding club.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to like that better than,
the government's going to send a team of
[SPEAKER_02]: people onto your land to see what you've
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems to work best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, in this case, was Bill working
with volunteers to go out onto these
[SPEAKER_02]: private lands to do point counts of bird
populations, to do butterfly monitoring
[SPEAKER_02]: surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while they were there, here's the
pathway that Bill saw as happening between
[SPEAKER_02]: that interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the point he wants to get to,
that the landowners implement grassland
[SPEAKER_02]: restoration practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's how he saw it happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needed to conduct surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The private landowners allow access to
citizen volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to the government people, but to the
citizen volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while they're there, the landowners
talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ask them what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are they doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that information, that informal
sharing of information, both the science
[SPEAKER_02]: and the context of conservation,
has more of an impact than visits from
[SPEAKER_02]: state employees, resulting in,
Bill theorizes, and in some cases has
[SPEAKER_02]: seen, changes in their actual management
of their lands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are just a few possibilities that
really suggest that attention to the
[SPEAKER_02]: social dimension of citizen science,
of public participation in scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: research, attention to the public
interest, to the degree and the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: participation, as well as the scientific
needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not instead of, but as well as the
scientific needs, can be a step towards
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And importantly, a step that is
commensurate with the science and not in
[SPEAKER_02]: opposition to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to suggest that these
insights can invite us to think both more
[SPEAKER_02]: critically and more expansively about
concepts like public engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: A concept that's a key mission of our own
institution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And public engagement can mean many things
to many different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can mean research that is shared with
the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientific knowledge that's disseminated
to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd also like to suggest that public
engagement can effectively involve
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting participants to be part of the
research process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This does have to be done carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have to be done where it's
appropriate to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all science is appropriate for citizen
science or for public engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in places where it is and where
there's a potential for that to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: impact, the evidence is suggesting to us
that more than just the science must be
[SPEAKER_02]: considered if we are to get to
conservation action through that research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to wrap up with something that
may seem to be at first like a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a non sequitur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is that back in 2011,
I helped convene a 60-person workshop at
[SPEAKER_02]: the American Museum of Natural History,
which was examining citizen science and
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation, called Engaging and Learning
for Conservation Through Public
[SPEAKER_02]: Participation in Scientific Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were a lot of great insights
that came out of that event as to what the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential of citizen science was and how
to work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But through evaluation, we also gained
some insights into the practitioner
[SPEAKER_02]: community themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's one that I want to share just
because it was so telling in its honesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was shared by presumably a
scientist who was in attendance there,
[SPEAKER_02]: a conservation scientist anonymous said,
even though it makes me uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: after this event, I'm thinking about ways
to communicate and interact on a regular
[SPEAKER_02]: and frequent basis with the science
education community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons that I'm sharing
this is that if we have a hard time
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with our colleagues across
campus, that can make it even more
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult and daunting to think about
interacting with the public effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd like to suggest that as this
conversation about public participation in
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific research grows and as the field
expands, which it is, that it demands that
[SPEAKER_02]: we step outside of our comfort zones,
not just with the public, but with our
[SPEAKER_02]: colleagues, and making this a truly
interdisciplinary practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because both Jay and Bill and the other
scientists that I interviewed for my
[SPEAKER_02]: research, they're not working in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not working alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working with colleagues to share
insights as to how to effectively engage
[SPEAKER_02]: the public in new and potentially
different ways to do both science and
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an aside, just before I close with a
few questions, I will note if anybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in this opportunity to engage
across disciplines and engage with other
[SPEAKER_02]: colleagues who are involved in public
participation in scientific research,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a conference being held in San
Jose, a pre-conference of the AAAS annual
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting on citizen science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our call for proposals has just
closed, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did receive over 400 proposals for
talks at that conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's shaping up to be a really
important event and well attended.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually want to close with some
questions that were offered by Megan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to put her on the spot here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we were corresponding in
advance of my coming here to give this
[SPEAKER_02]: talk, she was suggesting some questions
that really resonated with thinking that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And asking ourselves as a community,
how might we do things like develop
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities where appropriate for public
participation in scientific research?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we consider both the science and
the conservation possibilities of citizen
[SPEAKER_02]: science?
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, and this I think is maybe one
of the most important things as this field
[SPEAKER_02]: grows and people step into this practice,
how can both students and faculty be
[SPEAKER_02]: supported in engaging thoughtfully and
effectively in a practice that can go
[SPEAKER_02]: against some of the traditions and
expectations, particularly in academic
[SPEAKER_02]: departments, to do things in new and
different ways to achieve the results that
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably we all want to achieve for
conservation through our science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will close there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to repeat the question just for
the benefit of Geneva and the camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why conservation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't there other potential outcomes that
are just as relevant and just as engaging?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really should have given a little
bit more context in the beginning that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is my personal bias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing my research largely in
relationship to informal science education
[SPEAKER_02]: and conservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the field of citizen science is much,
much broader.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there is work now coming into
conversation under the term citizen
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really important to acknowledge
that that term citizen science is now
[SPEAKER_02]: being used to understand activities that
haven't always fallen under that
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's research now that's being
discussed under that term in public
[SPEAKER_02]: health, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly a long history in astronomy
research, in water quality monitoring,
[SPEAKER_02]: so conservation, yes, is one, you're
right, very timely, topical point of
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens to be an area, and we can talk
about why this might be, but an area where
[SPEAKER_02]: a large, large number of citizen science
projects have been focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And increasingly, citizen science is now
showing up in or moving into areas like
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology, even, but that's fairly
recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, conservation is one
action-oriented and social scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: just one example of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question that Don
asked about the, have there been any
[SPEAKER_02]: studies to corroborate the accuracy of
citizen science data?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll offer two answers to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, yes, hundreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other answer is the only study
that matters is the one that you do for
[SPEAKER_02]: your project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what matters is the design of a
given project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it meet the goals that you set out
for your project, whatever those might be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a core need of that is that citizen
science is science.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some things that have been
called citizen science that really,
[SPEAKER_02]: we could make an argument is largely just
education work and the science that
[SPEAKER_02]: results is secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is important, engagement in
science is important, but citizen science
[SPEAKER_02]: really has that core of useful,
usable scientific data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the usefulness of those data may not
show up for many years, if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, but the science is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any given project is going to have to go
through the difficult work of making sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that their project is designed in such a
way that it can produce those usable data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there are hundreds of papers for
individual discrete projects that do show
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, does the public have a
skew or a bias towards certain organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: or topics?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lab of ornithology, I'll say in some
ways, was very lucky in its history with
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen science because there were a lot
of people already birdwatching a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: highly skilled people already birdwatching
and our scientists very astutely were able
[SPEAKER_02]: to capitalize on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certainly other taxa for which
it has been more difficult to design
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen science projects and some of the
reasons that we started, the work that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done at the lab of ornithology to
look at the practice more broadly of
[SPEAKER_02]: citizen science was because we were
getting asked questions by people saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to design ebird for seahorses,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to design citizen science for
jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were realizing that you can't just
take an if you build it, they will come
[SPEAKER_02]: approach to citizen science because that's
certainly not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are now projects that are
successfully engaging people in doing
[SPEAKER_02]: things like folding proteins.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a project called Foldit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I've just started playing with and I
don't understand exactly how people get
[SPEAKER_02]: turned onto it yet, but it's gamifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a learning curve, so you really
have to commit to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, any project is going to attract a
certain subset of people who have a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular affinity for doing a certain
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But projects have been successful in
enticing people to do protein folding,
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at jellyfish, to do a wide range
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the onus is on the project developers
to really find out what those public
[SPEAKER_02]: interests are and how you can make your
project resonate with the people you're
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping to involve in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or vice versa, understand where there's
already a tension going on to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's of interest to you, like with
birds, and see how you can capitalize on
[SPEAKER_02]: that interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just caution, though, that I think
you mentioned something about school.
[SPEAKER_02]: That some of my early research was on
student science partnerships and could
[SPEAKER_02]: students effectively be motivated to
collect accurate data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a sort of one step removed
question there about or assumption about
[SPEAKER_02]: motivation, which is that students,
when they're in a classroom, are a captive
[SPEAKER_02]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they'll be there to take part in the
activities, but the motivation is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be more along the lines of I'm
doing it because my teacher said so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, you will find some that you will
be able to excite about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might not have been excited had they
not been exposed to it through school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But school is not necessarily a guarantee
of some kind of motivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't put data in there just because I
was trying to make the extreme results as
[SPEAKER_02]: visible as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will also say that one thing I want
to make very clear is that those were
[SPEAKER_02]: typologies that were developed just to
help us get a handle on the level
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape of what was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one project is a hard and fast
contributory project, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a co-created project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Projects can be designed to offer
primarily a contributory experience or
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily a co-created experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But individuals can engage in a project in
a wide range of approaches based on how
[SPEAKER_02]: engaged they may choose to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, in the Sherman's Creek
example, where the community was engaged
[SPEAKER_02]: in water quality monitoring, there were
some people who really just collected the
[SPEAKER_02]: data.
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed up and they collected the
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a smaller number of people who
did the whole process of data analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: protocol development, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those aren't hard and fast categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lines are slippery and blurry between
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really was a rubric for trying to
draw some general conclusions that would
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us to understand the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a way, that's a dodge of your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope it gives you a more helpful
answer.
Thank you.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our time is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
