[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we bought a drone for our field
research program this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been very helpful for us to be able
to see our studies from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you can see things that you
wouldn't notice so readily or at all from
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground, so it's been very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other nice things about it is
for interested parties who can't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the site, we can send them photos with
plot plans so they can see treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: differences for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set it to take photos at any
interval you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it set to take a photo every five
seconds and you can also do video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I now can just take the memory card back
to the office, plug it into my computer
[SPEAKER_01]: and choose the photos that I want to save
and get rid of the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
