[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor to be here, and I'm excited
to talk about gene editing, because that's
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of the new technology, the next step
in genomics, in biology, and in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the question is, what is the
regulatory pathway for those products,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what's the consumer pathway for
consumer acceptance of those products?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think I'm going to give you
all the answers today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to provide you, hopefully,
with some new information about what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on around the world on those topics,
and I'll give you some of my thoughts
[SPEAKER_03]: about where I think things need to go,
and predict, therefore, a little bit of
where I think it will go in the future,
but hopefully provide you some different
ways to think about these topics as you go
forward in a lot of the work that's done
[SPEAKER_03]: here at Cornell and at TALS in particular.
So with that, I'm going to jump right in.
I am going to set the stage a little bit,
just what is gene editing, what are the
[SPEAKER_03]: different applications of gene editing,
for those of you who don't know as much
[SPEAKER_03]: about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'm going to talk, primarily spend a
lot of time on the regulatory situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: both in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and other parts of the world, give my
thoughts on where that should move
[SPEAKER_03]: forward, and then talk about consumer
acceptance and transparency of products of
[SPEAKER_03]: this technology with some final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is gene editing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Gene editing is really the ability to make
specific genetic changes within the
[SPEAKER_03]: organism's genome, where we can identify a
specific location, and then identify a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific kind of alteration we might want
in that location in the genome.
It could be an insertion of DNA,
it could be a lesion, a point mutation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a wheeled swap, and it really does
take advantage of the natural process of
[SPEAKER_03]: errors in normal DNA, so there are a
number of different tools, gene editing
[SPEAKER_03]: tools, that are used to gene edit a
genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have zinc finger nucleases,
mega nucleases, alan, CRISPRs,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I put in red because that's the one
that everybody seems to talk about these
[SPEAKER_03]: days, the easiest to do, the sort of the
one that's the best today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also put down at the end of the
slide, and there are others, and there
[SPEAKER_03]: will be others in the future, I think if I
give those thoughts five years from now,
[SPEAKER_03]: there probably will be one or two other
gene editing tools that have been added to
[SPEAKER_03]: that toolbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a lawyer, as a regulator,
we'll have to think about, we're not just
gonna do it in CRISPR, but whatever we're
going to do, we have to realize that the
science is gonna keep evolving,
that it's gonna keep changing,
and how do we address that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really wanted to point that out,
because this is an evolving science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also wanted to point out just a
little bit about what gets done,
[SPEAKER_03]: because what gets done helps us think
about how consumers might accept it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how regulators might do what laws
might apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my one slide that I stole from
somebody to talk about how gene editing
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we look at the green part of the DNA
here, this is the part of the DNA we want
[SPEAKER_03]: to edit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we set up an RNA molecule that has that
same base pair, analogous base pair
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with it, we add the enzyme that
cuts to that, we take that complex,
[SPEAKER_03]: put it into the cell, it finds the DNA
match, and it goes and cuts, and at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point, we either let normal repair
mechanisms occur, which might lead to a
[SPEAKER_03]: quantitation, a silencing of that gene,
or we could add DNA at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could also put in a specific piece of
DNA that we want to introduce,
which could be a whole new gene,
or it could be a portion of a gene,
or a promoter, whatever we want to
introduce at that stage in the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we're talking about when we
talk about gene editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to mention that not all gene
editing is the same, and that I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: very important to the discussion we're
having.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can, we could add a gene from a
same organism or from a different organism
[SPEAKER_03]: with gene editing tools, we could add a
few nucleotides in one location or in
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple locations, or we could even
delete a few nucleotides in one location
[SPEAKER_03]: or multiple locations, or a huge amount of
the genome, hundreds of base pairs,
[SPEAKER_03]: or thousands of base pairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not all gene editing is the same,
but when we hear the discussion around the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation of it, a lot of times,
there is this sort of thought that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: all one thing, that everybody's doing the
same thing, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, I just want to sort of put this
in context.
[SPEAKER_03]: So gene editing may be the most recent way
to alter plants and animals in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, but scientists have been
using a lot of different techniques to
[SPEAKER_03]: modify plants and to change the genomes of
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: For traits that are valuable to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this slide just sets forth a number of
those different things, genome editing
[SPEAKER_03]: being one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I think about these, I've done a
really bad job in this slide of conveying
[SPEAKER_03]: that these things are a continuum,
but when you look at all these techniques
[SPEAKER_03]: now, they've gotten to the point where
they all blur together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no longer able to think about them on
a straight line continuum to some extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we have different kinds of gene
editing techniques, different kinds of
things.
We have more classical things like
chemical or radiation mutagenesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have genetic engineering, GMOs,
and transgenics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some of the different gene editing
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I put them on which of these are more
controllable or less controllable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do gene silencing with this,
but we also can do it with this.
We can add a gene with these techniques,
but we can also add it with this
technique.
So these things begin to mold together on
a continuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It begins to differentiate, which as a
lawyer becomes difficult because laws and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations like to have bright line
definitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very hard to have a bright line
definition anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So recently the World Economic Forum came
out with a white paper on bioinnovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to quote a couple words from
this, which talk about this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They talk about gene editing and they say,
the degree of intervention makes up a more
continuous spectrum.
Determining low versus high levels of
genetic alteration, natural versus
[SPEAKER_03]: artificial outcomes, or low versus high
risk cases, is becoming a question of
[SPEAKER_03]: judgment on a continuous spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, depending on the type of
graduated change in organist genome,
[SPEAKER_03]: gene editing could produce a product
identical to one created with traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: mutagenesis, or a product identical to a
transgenic GMO.
No longer are there clear directions for
transgenic methods, conventional methods,
[SPEAKER_03]: biotechnology, and other methods,
and so forth and on and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that really captures this idea
that these things are all blending
[SPEAKER_03]: together to some extent, and you can't
make those big distinctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I want to briefly just talk
about some of the applications that are
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody in the room has sort of a
common understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have lots of things in the pipeline
on the plant side, things like higher leg
[SPEAKER_03]: soybeans, improved gene editing from a
company like CalEx, a high fiber wheat,
[SPEAKER_03]: also from CalEx.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lower saturated canola oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have scientists working on citrus fruit
resistant to citrus greening disease using
CRISPR.
We have scientists working on cassava
resistant to Brown's group virus using
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about crops that are used
in the United States, also used in
[SPEAKER_03]: developing countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: People trying to prevent chocolate from
extinction using CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a number of things on the plant side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, we have things on the
animal side.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hornless cattle is the one that I
think gets the most press out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the allele from Angus cattle that
are normally hornless and trying to put
that into dairy cattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's an example out there.
We have one CRISPR that was done to
produce a lower fat egg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have also swine resistant to the 14
reproductive and respiratory syndrome
[SPEAKER_03]: virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a number of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could have put up 40 more slides for
things that are all in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the question with all these
becomes, a lot of these are proof of
[SPEAKER_03]: concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of these will actually make it to
market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of these will actually be products
out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that background, I wanted to now
get into sort of the regulation of gene
editing at agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of what is the, what I'm gonna
talk about now is sort of what is the
[SPEAKER_03]: current regulatory situation in both the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and in other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to promise that, I look at this
regulatory debate that goes on as a light
[SPEAKER_03]: switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the debate that's going on is
the question is, is the gene editor
[SPEAKER_03]: product a GMO, in which case it's
regulated, the light switch is on,
[SPEAKER_03]: or is it not a GMO, in which case the
light switch is off, and it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, I have to characterize the
debate that's going on around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the debate that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, the answer to that is unclear.
[SPEAKER_03]: In most countries, it's pretty still
unclear what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, if we look at all the 200
countries around the world, if there's not
[SPEAKER_03]: a clear pick of the light switch being on,
or the light switch being off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that practice, what's the story in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory system?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the takeaway from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory system is currently,
it treats gene edited products the same as
[SPEAKER_03]: a GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I'm gonna repeat that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It treats gene edited products the same as
a GMO, and now I'm gonna tell you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, from a legal perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to do that, you have to have a
little understanding of what the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory system is in the United States
for GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: regulates genetic engineered crops under
the Plant Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't expect everybody to know all
this or understand all this, but the Plant
[SPEAKER_03]: Protection Act is how they regulate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they've historically said was,
you can't release a genetic engineered
[SPEAKER_03]: crop into the environment without getting
a permit from USDA under the Plant
[SPEAKER_03]: Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, you deregulate that so
that farmers can grow it, and nobody needs
[SPEAKER_03]: permits anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their trigger, their legal trigger,
what the law is protecting is plant pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the law is trying to protect the
environment, agricultural environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: from introduction of plant pests into the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the trigger has been that a GM crop
could be a potential plant pest,
[SPEAKER_03]: and therefore, it needed to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And primarily, that was based on the fact
that the transformation vehicle,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way you got the new gene into the
plant, that new trait that was engineered,
was through agrobacterium.
And agrobacterium is a listed plant pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agrobacterium infects plants and causes
disease in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was the traditional way that
they got the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can sit here today and say,
before 2010, all genetic engineered crops
were regulated.
If you had a genetic engineered crop in
the United States, you would do research
at a place like Cornell.
You couldn't do that research outside of a
laboratory without getting a permit from
USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: After 2010, it depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all GMOs, or genetic engineered crops,
the genetically modified crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you want to call them,
are currently regulated at USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you use agrobacterium as your
transformation vector, you are regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you use the gene gun, you're not
regulated, because the gene gun
[SPEAKER_03]: holistically pushes that DNA into the
cell, and you're not using a plant pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, contrary to what people think,
that all GMOs are regulated in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a transgenic sorghum that's
being developed by Ceres, a biotech
[SPEAKER_03]: company, and they went to USDA and said,
you know, we introduced an orange gene,
[SPEAKER_03]: a gene from a different species,
into our sorghum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we regulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: And USDA said, in a letter back to them,
you didn't use any plant pests in your
[SPEAKER_03]: construct or in your method of
transformation, so you are not regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a number of other,
I could put other examples up there,
[SPEAKER_03]: none of them are commercial products yet,
as far as I'm aware of.
But there are other things in the pipeline
that USDA said won't be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of your takeaways is not all GMOs
are regulated in the United States by
[SPEAKER_03]: USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, people, researchers who are
developing gene-edited crops, have also
[SPEAKER_03]: gone to USDA and said, am I regulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the non-browning mushroom, probably one
of the most popular ones, had a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: popular press, used CRISPR, a Penn State
researcher used CRISPR to make it
non-browning, to silence the gene,
and USDA said you didn't use any plant
pests in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: CRISPR itself, the CRISPR molecule,
is not a plant pest, and so we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna regulate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, they've said that for,
here's a chameleon oil that was used,
CRISPR-Cas9 was used with that,
and again, I could put up probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple dozen of these that have gone
through this am I regulated process at
[SPEAKER_03]: USDA, and said that they're not regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd say, well, and as far as I know,
they've not said that any gene-edited
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, you are regulated yet, in fact.
So Secretary Perdue made a statement
earlier this year, where he said,
and this is from the press release,
U.S.
does not regulate or have any plants
regulated, plants that could otherwise
[SPEAKER_03]: have been developed with traditional
breeding techniques, as long as they are
[SPEAKER_03]: not plant pests or developed using plant
pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and he gives the example of genome
editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he specifically says, sort of
memorializes what USDA has been doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: saying as long as there's no plant pest
involved, it's not gonna be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they then went on to talk about things
that could be included, would be
[SPEAKER_03]: deletions, single-paste pairs,
and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, they also have this caveat that
could be developed with traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding techniques, which they didn't
define.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the current regulatory system at
USDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: FDA also regulates genetically engineered
or all our foods, and they currently have
[SPEAKER_03]: a voluntary consultation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where they look at the genetically
engineered plant and compare it to its
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional counterpart and ask whether
there's substantial equivalence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to date, there's no reason not to
believe that every single developer and
[SPEAKER_03]: every single genetically modified crop
that's out there has been through that
[SPEAKER_03]: voluntary process.
And that was what the government has
proposed, the same thing for gene-edited
crops, saying you're not required to come
in, but you could come in, and we're happy
[SPEAKER_03]: to look at the data associated with it and
see that the gene-edited crop is
[SPEAKER_03]: substantially equivalent to its
conventional counterpart.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the animal side, there is a mandatory
free market approval process currently for
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically engineered animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's under the new animal drug
provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
[SPEAKER_03]: Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't wanna go into a lot of detail
about that, but a new animal drug is
[SPEAKER_03]: defined as anything that alters the
structure or function of an animal.
And if you add a gene or you change the
genetics of the cell, you are altering the
structure of that cell.
You're altering the structure of that DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they've interpreted that,
we can argue whether that's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation or not, but they've
interpreted that to say, therefore,
[SPEAKER_03]: that change in the DNA, that adding of
that gene changes the structure or
[SPEAKER_03]: function of that animal, and therefore,
it's a new animal product that needs to be
approved.
They also proposed the same treatment for
gene-edited animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, if you change, if you
intentionally change a base pair of the
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA of an animal, you are creating a new
animal drug, and therefore, it also needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a proposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been finalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: This administration hasn't withdrawn that
proposal, but they also haven't said,
[SPEAKER_03]: endorsed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They sort of said, we're looking into
this, how we're gonna regulate gene-edited
[SPEAKER_03]: products holistically, and they haven't
really announced anything, but that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: most recent pronouncement from FDA on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I look at those together,
and there's another agency, EPA,
[SPEAKER_03]: that regulates, but I'm not gonna,
certain genetic engineering crops that
[SPEAKER_03]: have pesticides in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not gonna cover that today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I look at this regulatory system,
what observations do I get?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not particularly science or
risk-based, and I'll argue that it either
[SPEAKER_03]: has over-regulation or under-regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my example is, so if I change one base
pair of a genetic engineering,
[SPEAKER_03]: of a gene-edited crop, it's a voluntary
consultation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a validation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I change one base pair of an
animal, it's a mandatory pre-market
[SPEAKER_03]: approval process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it hard to argue that changing one
base pair in two different species could
[SPEAKER_03]: have that very risk profile that one gets
a very high level of scrutiny and
[SPEAKER_03]: oversight, and one gets a very low level
of scrutiny and oversight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere along the line, somebody's being
over-regulated or somebody's being
[SPEAKER_03]: under-regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, if we compare it to GMOs in the
USDA instance, if I use the gene gun to
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce a gene to stop citrus screening,
it's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I use agrobacterium to introduce that
same gene, so I have the same phenotype,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the same genotype, it is regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I get the same phenotype by
deleting and silencing a gene using gene
[SPEAKER_03]: editing, I get the same phenotype,
and it's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, somewhere along the line,
something's either being over-regulated or
[SPEAKER_03]: under-regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to argue that this is a
science-based, risk-based system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever your view is of whether things
should be regulated or not regulated,
[SPEAKER_03]: the system that's existing, I think,
has lots of flaws in it from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to point out that it's not
related to foreign DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the debate over whether something's a
GMO or not, the biggest issue is,
[SPEAKER_03]: did we introduce some foreign DNA into it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory system plays no role,
whether it's foreign DNA or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whether it's a plant pest,
whether it's a food, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other triggers, but the trigger is not
whether you added foreign DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you have is, and that's why I
argue, they're treating GMOs and
[SPEAKER_03]: gene-edited crops the same from a legal
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using the same laws and the same
interpretations of those laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they apply them to the different
products, you get different results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you'll get is most GMOs get
regulated by USDA, but most gene-edited
[SPEAKER_03]: products are not gonna get regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because they've been exempt or found
safe, but because they don't use
[SPEAKER_03]: agrobacteria or they don't use a plant
pest, whereas GMOs use the plant pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the gene-edited did use a plant
pest or they had a plant pest associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with it, it would be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similarly, GMO gene-edited animals are
regulated by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get different results because their
legal trigger, any change in the DNA,
[SPEAKER_03]: applies equally for both genetically
modified animals and gene-edited animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I say that they are treated
the same legally and regulatorily,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the outcome may be different when you
apply it to the facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the regulatory situation in
other countries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the debate is, is the light switch
on or is the light switch off?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I switched directly to the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you may have heard that it was a
big issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a court case in front of the
European Court of Justice brought by a
[SPEAKER_03]: French NGO that went to a French court,
and the French court certified the issue
to the European Court of Justice,
which said, are gene-edited crops covered
by the GMO law, the GMO directive in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this past July, the European Court of
Justice said, yes, they are covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they did, and I wanna spend a
minute on it because I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: misunderstood by a lot of people,
is what they said was, it pretty much just
[SPEAKER_03]: did a pretty standard interpretation of
the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people wrote, a lot of
articles were written about displaying the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Court of Justice as being
anti-science, all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they made a science
determination.
They pretty much applied the law as they
interpreted the law of Parliament.
If there's a critique of this decision,
the critique is that Parliament wrote a
law that was overly broad and that that
should be revision for this technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: not that the European Court of Justice got
it radically wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what the Court of Justice did was,
so a GMO under the directive is an
[SPEAKER_03]: organism in which the genetic material has
been altered in a way that does not
[SPEAKER_03]: coordinate naturally by mating or natural
recombination.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And under that definition, things like
mutagenesis are included as GMOs under
[SPEAKER_03]: that law.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're exempt from the requirements
of that law if they don't involve the use
[SPEAKER_03]: of recombinant DNA molecules for GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the concept is chemical mutagenesis or
radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do produce a GMO under the
definition, but they're exempt because
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't need recombinant DNA.
And what the European Justice Court does
is that in the law that Parliament passed,
[SPEAKER_03]: Parliament said the reason they did that
was these other techniques have been
[SPEAKER_03]: conventionally used in a number of
applications to have a long safety record.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a finding of fact from the
European Parliament.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the European Court of Justice said,
well, then that only really covers
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional mutagenic techniques with a
long history of safety.
And CRISPR is a new technique without that
long history of safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't qualify for what they meant
that exclusion to include.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can argue about what they should
have, what should be their proper role.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the Court wasn't so out of
pace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did a blog post that you're welcome
to if you want to read more about that
detail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not the only court that's done
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So New Zealand has a law about GMOs,
their Hazardous Substance and New Organism
[SPEAKER_03]: Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, a GMO is defined as any
organism with which any of the genes or
[SPEAKER_03]: other mutagenic material has been modified
by in-detro techniques.
So it's pretty hard to argue that gene
editing is not an in-detro technique.
And it's modifying DNA.
And to some extent, that's what the Court
included.
It said that on this basis, the zinc
figure 1 techniques are most similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: the mutagenic modification and therefore
are covered under the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went back to this definition.
And again, we can argue that that should
be the definition of a GMO or a definition
for any genetically altered kind of
organism.
But that's what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have in the international context
several countries whose laws have been
[SPEAKER_03]: interpreted to include gene editing as a
GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have countries like Argentina,
which to a large extent has said,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to work with this on a
case-by-case basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you go through their analysis,
and this may be a little hard to read,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what they're saying is, if you've done
a gene editing prop, you do an early
[SPEAKER_03]: consultation with the Biosafety Committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to ask you, is there a
new combination of genetic material
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it is, then they say, yes,
it's a GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not, then they're going to ask,
well, did you use a transgene?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there a transgene as a final
product?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's no transgene, in the final
product, and no new DNA in the final
[SPEAKER_03]: product, then it's not going to be
covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so pretty much what their trigger is,
is there foreign DNA or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's no foreign DNA in the final
product, even if there is an intermediary
[SPEAKER_03]: product, then it's not going to be
regulated as a GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go through an assessment to
comment that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they've done in several
other South American countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil, which will follow in that lead.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have countries like Israel that also
have a similar regulatory system where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're saying, as long as there aren't
foreign DNA sequences in it, then it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: being regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you and I can also sit down and have a
discussion about whether that's really a
[SPEAKER_03]: good scientific trigger, maybe a good way
to deal with the regulatory situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's in all DNA, DNA to some extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have genes from other species in
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other species have genes in them
from other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is foreign to some extent?
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have a real good esoteric
discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Countries like Japan have not made a
decision yet, but a government committee
has said that certain forms of gene
editing, again, most of the time when we
[SPEAKER_03]: hear that, it means single base pair
deletions, but not those more complex
[SPEAKER_03]: things, might not be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The United Kingdom, interestingly,
when they were asked about gene editing,
[SPEAKER_03]: they argued to the European community that
if the changes in the DNA could have
[SPEAKER_03]: occurred naturally or through traditional
breeding, then they would not be.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was similar to what occurred
naturally through traditional breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as a single point mutation,
then it shouldn't be regulated as a GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they argued scientifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they also said when they were leaving
Brexit, that they would incorporate the
[SPEAKER_03]: GMO laws of the European Union into the
new UK laws, because they didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: upset trade with the EU.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted to say that they weren't
introducing their food safety laws and
[SPEAKER_03]: their environmental laws to their
citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now they're in a quandary,
because with the European Court of
[SPEAKER_03]: Decision, they said that they're going to
follow the GMO law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the GMO law says that gene editing
crops are now GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see where that ends up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have other countries that I
don't think have even gotten a decision
[SPEAKER_03]: yet, but if you look at their definitions,
you go to Philippine saying a GMO is any
[SPEAKER_03]: novel combination of genetic material
obtained through modern biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, as a lawyer, opens a lot of
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghana says an organism that has its own
gene modified without the insertion of any
[SPEAKER_03]: of these genes and their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard to argue under that definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gene editing isn't included.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it says any gene is modified,
and you don't even have to add anything to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the fact that it's been modified
covers it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the international
agreement in this area, the Cardian
[SPEAKER_03]: Biosafety Protocol, which says that modern
biotechnology is in vitro and nucleic acid
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think gene editing qualifies as an in
vitro and nucleic acid technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question becomes, does it overcome
natural physical production or
[SPEAKER_03]: recombination barriers?
[SPEAKER_03]: And are not techniques used in traditional
breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: It clearly is not used in traditional
breeding, but it produces things similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that get interpreted?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unclear, in my mind, as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I said the regulatory
situation, I think, overall is unclear
[SPEAKER_03]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still many decisions to be made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even in the countries that we think
are clear, they're still not, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: the final word on those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are some observations on a
possible way forward for this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think when you look at this,
the government and stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_03]: when they talk about regulation,
they discuss gene editing every month,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether things are regulated based on sort
of three triggers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask whether there's foreign DNA or
transiting in the final product,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether the edit in the product is or
could have been found in nature,
[SPEAKER_03]: or whether the edit could have been
produced through conventional or
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional breeding, chemical mutagenesis
or in radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure any of those triggers
actually hold up as a scientific matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may hold up as a legal matter,
but I'm not sure they really hold up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a lawyer, I don't define things
like foreign DNA or found in nature
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional or traditional to know what
the boundaries of those things are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is where the debate is going,
and that leads to this question of whether
[SPEAKER_03]: that's on or off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, my personal view is that a
binary option is a high risk game because
[SPEAKER_03]: the likelihood of 180 countries all
turning the light switch off is near zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you have a few countries turning
it on, then you run into trade issues and
[SPEAKER_03]: other issues that I'll talk about in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the light switch gets on,
you get this whole level of oversight that
[SPEAKER_03]: probably isn't relevant and isn't related
to the risk profile of the gene editing
[SPEAKER_03]: crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're trying to push gene editing into
two different options neither of which
[SPEAKER_03]: fits well in the gene editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're pushing square pegs into
round holes, and you're making a binary
[SPEAKER_03]: decision, and I just think that's gonna
end up in a bad situation overall if you
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, Bill Gates had an article
in a journal a while ago where he talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about gene editing, and one of the things
he said, which I liked about it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, rules developed decades ago
where other forms of genetic entry don't
fit necessarily fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the key here, and we're
trying to fit something that doesn't fit,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're doing that in a very risky way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my idea is we need to broad that
discussion between those two options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulation can take many forms,
and we have many different kinds of gene
[SPEAKER_03]: editing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a silenced gene versus 12 silenced
genes to produce a metabolic pathway
[SPEAKER_03]: versus adding DNA versus from one species
from different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want more of a science-based
risk system that has a number of different
[SPEAKER_03]: buckets where we can have different
categories for different types of
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the questions we should be asking
are, what are the potential risks of
[SPEAKER_03]: anything from the process?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the potential risks of anything
from the products made using that process?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that risk profile compare to
other agricultural breeding techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: products?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there are risks that need
regulation, what system would be
[SPEAKER_03]: proportionate to those risks and set up a
system based on those potential risks for
[SPEAKER_03]: those categories?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, Bloomberg had an editorial
that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't tell them about this,
but it sort of said the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was saying, a better approach then
is a middle course, rather than prejudge
[SPEAKER_03]: the products of biotechnology readily.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should screen them and single out those
that might need special monitoring or
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea that we should have a mandatory
system, but we should, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically help scoop the way,
but that it wouldn't be either of the
systems we have currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I go for this proportionate
risk-based system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll leave you with this sort of
example, and this is my basis for this,
[SPEAKER_03]: is basically we have three different
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of these products are in the
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you if they will make it out
to the market or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we have one, gene-edited cold
storage potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calix is using Talens, and they've
inactivated a single gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've silenced a single gene to
produce this cold storage potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have another biotech company,
that has turned off three genes to make a
[SPEAKER_03]: hypoallergenic peanut, to reduce the
allergenicity of peanuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a third institute,
this one in Spain, that's used CRISPR to
[SPEAKER_03]: build 35 different genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've silenced 35 different genes,
and they're making a gluten-reduced wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, do these three things
have the same level of risk?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they deserve the same level of
oversight?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they do.
This one, I may have no problem with it.
Maybe this gets no oversight, no need for
a risk assessment, no need to have any
government oversight, or maybe just a
registry of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, my food safety hat comes on and
says, do I really want to trust this
[SPEAKER_03]: company that this is allergen-free,
or do I want the government just checking
[SPEAKER_03]: and making sure before that gets out
there, that that's an allergen-free
[SPEAKER_03]: peanut, and it's not going to cost people
to go to the hospitals with an allergen
[SPEAKER_03]: illness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one, again, do I worry about the
food safety issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're starting with 35 genes,
are there any other things that have
[SPEAKER_03]: happened because we've done so many
changes in the genome that we want
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody checking that out?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my view is these three things get three
different levels of oversight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the system that's being proposed would
either treat all of these as no oversight
[SPEAKER_03]: whatsoever, or all of them as GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's where the system is
meant for, I think, going wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put this final quote to that
bio-infinite innovation report that talks
[SPEAKER_03]: about this idea that we want appropriate
regulation, proportionate oversight,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually helps developers bring products
to market, and an independent safety
assessment gives consumers trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have an overly stringent one with
costly regulations, that prevents things
[SPEAKER_03]: from going to the marketplace,
and if there's no oversight, consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: question the safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got to figure out that balance in
this situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there is no federal regulation,
what might happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have state oversight.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are states that could regulate
genetic engineering crops, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_03]: they could regulate gene editing crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could have some states, California
and Minnesota, others, begin to regulate
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that better, having different states
doing things than having them all give up
[SPEAKER_03]: our federal system?
[SPEAKER_03]: We clearly will have other countries,
because I can guarantee that not
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what will be the trade impacts of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We still need some level of harmonization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do we want the fact that China,
so say we don't regulate it here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and China regulates it, are our farmers
then beholden before China approves it and
[SPEAKER_03]: they get to grow it?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the good things about regulation of
GMOs, that people don't know we talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about, is when we regulate it here,
a lot of countries defer to our
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Korea and Japan and others look at our
risk assessment and say, we don't need to
[SPEAKER_03]: do a second one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're not doing anything,
who are they going to rely upon?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they don't agree with us that it
needs no regulation, then they may rely
[SPEAKER_03]: upon China or the EU.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do we want that, or would we rather be
the leaders saying, what is the level of
[SPEAKER_03]: oversight that goes on?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll leave you with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk a little bit about consumer
acceptance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what consumers care the most about
is an assurance of safety, transparency,
[SPEAKER_03]: and beneficial products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what have different stakeholders been
saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: As you might imagine, a lot of the NGOs
have said, this is genetic engineering,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that this is being promoted the
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying it's the same using
dependence on chemicals, even though it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they are calling for regulation and
calling for people not to eat products
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The National Organic Standards Board voted
in 2016 to make a recommendation to USDA
[SPEAKER_03]: that gene editing be an excluded method,
similar to genetic engineering,
[SPEAKER_03]: that has not been accepted yet by the
administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not part of the organic standards,
but you can see where they're going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have the non-GMO project pretty
much saying, these are GMOs, and we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to include them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here is their Twitter, don't be
fooled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Products and products from new tech-like
gene editing symbiotic are GMOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either way, whether there's regulation
or not, and whether there's consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptance or not, there's going to be a
differentiation in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's already happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: You already see that with some products.
[SPEAKER_03]: The non-GMO project, the organic
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to some extent, many consumers may not
understand these legal scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: distinctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start explaining to them gene
editing, to the extent that somebody knows
[SPEAKER_03]: about genetic engineering, and I'm not
saying many consumers know, it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be very hard to make that distinction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is a foreign gene distinction maybe
important for regulation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that will be as important to
consumer acceptance is, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: an open question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, the factors for consumer
acceptance are, has it been found,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, by an independent party?
These are the questions that consumers are
going to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has it been found, say, by an independent
party?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there benefits and who benefits?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it fit into their view of food,
nutrition, sustainability?
And what do influential people they
respect say?
Those are the kinds of things that I think
they're going to ask.
I'm not saying that those aren't easy to
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there will be many consumers
who will accept gene editing products.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that there's going to be
some discussion about it at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the issue of transparency, I think one
of the things we've learned is if
[SPEAKER_03]: something's hidden from consumers,
they wonder why.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's hidden, is there some reason it's
hidden?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for consumers who want to know,
which I think is a very small segment of
[SPEAKER_03]: the population, the information needs to
be available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's no regulation, how will the
food chain and consumers know when these
[SPEAKER_03]: products are commercialized?
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought is we need a national register.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a non-browning mushroom is out
there, a supermarket chain like Wekman's
[SPEAKER_03]: can go look and say, there are
non-browning mushrooms out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't look at transparency as
labeling, but I do look at it as the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to know what's out there and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing that I think will impact
consumer acceptance in this area is what I
[SPEAKER_03]: call the wild card, which is CRISPR and
gene editing is going to be used in human
[SPEAKER_03]: gene editing and in gene drives and
conservation areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how is that going to affect consumers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going to make them more likely to
be favorable to this or less likely?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have research being done to correct
sickle cell anemia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've addressed a number of different
single point mutation genetic diseases in
[SPEAKER_03]: humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they cure sickle cell anemia,
that might really give us a boost and
[SPEAKER_03]: might actually help consumers accept this
in other fields like agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're also using gene drives and
things to eradicate rats and mice in
[SPEAKER_03]: places like New Zealand to end malaria.
If this works, again, that may pave the
way to acceptance.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't work, or if we start
creating designer babies or other things,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could backfire and it could go the
other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something, the wild card
here that people forget about,
[SPEAKER_03]: that as opposed to GMOs, which have really
been made only with agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're ethical issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of other issues on these other
aspects of gene editing that are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: overflow into the agricultural debate from
at least the public's perception of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the interesting things,
which I'll leave you with, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go through these whole quotes,
but Commissioner Gottlieb at USDA was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about gene editing and talking
about regulation of it, and pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: was saying, I, being the commissioner,
I'm in charge of both human and human drug
therapies as well as animal drug
therapies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I say that I don't regulate a
single base pair change in an animal,
[SPEAKER_03]: do I do the same thing for humans,
which would be the methods for solving
sickle cell anemia?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do I make the science that gene
editing done in animals isn't subject to
[SPEAKER_03]: different laws of nature than when these
tools are applied to people?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never heard anybody in the
administration make this argument before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it, again, makes you think about the
leading over of these different areas and
[SPEAKER_03]: that the, while we may want a certain
precedent in agriculture, we also have to
[SPEAKER_03]: worry that those precedents, how do those
precedents apply in the conservation or
[SPEAKER_03]: how do they apply in the human area?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying that with a bias one
way or the other, just a point to keep in
[SPEAKER_03]: mind that that is something that's in the
minds of people on this issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are my conclusions?
You know, I think regulation should be
based on science and risk.
I think the regulatory situation right now
internationally is uncertain.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I think the existing laws are having
trouble keeping up with the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I would say that for the last 30
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll probably say for the next 30
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not unique to biotech.
[SPEAKER_03]: That there is going to be market
segmentation because some consumers will
[SPEAKER_03]: not want the edited products, whether or
not matter how beneficial they are and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the ethical reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be a small portion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how these techniques are used and what
products are developed will impact
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think in the end, if it's a
benefit for consumers, consumers adopt
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, what's the benefit for
consumers?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's a benefit out there that
consumers perceive as a benefit,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will fly off the shelf and nobody's
going to care about whether it's gene
[SPEAKER_03]: edited, genetically modified or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is to date a lot of this stuff
is more about the environment or the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers or others.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the end, transparency is going
to be crucial all around.
I think we've learned in this internet age
that we're in, in this immediate access to
[SPEAKER_03]: information age, that without
transparency, people are always going to
[SPEAKER_03]: question why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just going to automatically
make you start an uphill battle that you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to end there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I don't answer them, please feel
free to email me and I'll try to answer
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all for your time.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the examples we gave in various
countries were really based on the
process, not the product.
But Canada used to have one really based
on the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll answer that two ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the Canadian system is based
on novelty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would think it would treat gene
edited crops the same as a GMO crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's novel, if the product is novel,
then it would be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not novel, then your definition of
novel wouldn't be regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they would treat GM and GM and
gene edited the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the Canadian system isn't product
based, if I had a friend diagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not aware of them ever taking a GMO
and saying it's not novel and doesn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you look at what they've regulated
under that law, you took an end diagram of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that's been GMO has been
regulated in one or two other things that
[SPEAKER_03]: are not GMO regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So although it's a product based system,
it's hard to argue that it really is
[SPEAKER_03]: independent of process because they've
never exempted anything from it that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just a side on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My own take is that the product process is
not really a good one because we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at both.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing a risk assessment,
you don't just look at the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also look at the process that made
that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That informs the process, the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do a risk assessment of that
product?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as my example before, if you use CRISPR
and you don't add a gene that produces a
[SPEAKER_03]: protein, you don't need to do a risk
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you made a citrus greening one and
you do introduce a gene from peanuts,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you have who take the issue to look
at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that process, it's not just the
phenotype at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to look at that genotype in
addition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that does involve some process
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my regulatory system would have a
combination of the product and the process
[SPEAKER_03]: is not one or the other sold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions from Geneva?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll chat back to you in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else have any questions here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a comment maybe you can respond to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the whole argument about
this light switch is focused on process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of predicated on this human
instinct to treat anything that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: natural with suspicion or that's not well
established or conventional with
[SPEAKER_00]: suspicion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have sort of this aversion to new
things because we're just not sure if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me that also is sort of linked to,
in a sense, religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if it's natural, it's God-given
bounty, it's healthy and safe for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we somehow manipulate it,
it isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a way to sway public opinion
if it's so deeply grounded in that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: human instinct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody in this room knows that
a reader in a few generations could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a toxic sweet potato through
conventional means, natural reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then nature is full of all kinds of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so much of the focus on the
process, the knowledge of the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk inherent in the process,
comes from this deeply ingrained part of
[SPEAKER_00]: human nature that has an aversion to the
unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any chance of actually moving
something forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: So on one point I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some ways I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly we live with the concept that
things that are familiar to us,
we're comfortable with.
Things that are new or different,
we're less comfortable with.
And we always look at those with some
exceptions, whether that's natural,
unnatural, or that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so things that are novel and new,
we raise a hand.
Going back to your little two-year-old,
when you want to give them something,
[SPEAKER_03]: a two-year-old is always safe saying no.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always exchange their mind and say
yes later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But their initial reaction is to say no,
because they don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't want to be on the safe
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so human nature, I think, is initially
to say no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we do regulate things that are just
novel and new, because they're novel and
[SPEAKER_03]: new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually we hope they become familiar
and there's no need to regulate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that is just consumer
confidence and to let people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable with something, because they
don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you change that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, part of it, the agricultural
field, is making people more aware of how
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture, how food gets to their table,
where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the examples I give when I talk
about what is natural, and a talk I give
[SPEAKER_03]: is I give an example of fluo, a cross
between an apricot and a plum,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a total human invention.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't cross that sexually naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks.
You pick it from a tree.
It looks as natural as can be.
It's a piece of fruit.
It came from a tree.
It came from the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun was on it, water, not much else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet you and I know that it's the
farthest thing from natural, whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: natural means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully with education, we in real
life, people can begin to realize that
[SPEAKER_03]: there isn't this, while their instinct is
this big dichotomy or this big break
[SPEAKER_03]: between being natural and not natural,
the reality is in the biological world,
[SPEAKER_03]: that distinction doesn't exist and
everything is continual and therefore to
[SPEAKER_03]: feel more comfortable with things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you're always going to have
hesitations with anything that's due,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's biological or other kinds of
things, unless there's a major benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cell phones, everybody chokes you even
though it was new, because that's such a
[SPEAKER_03]: great benefit to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I go back to factorization,
which was a new technique that took a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time to be accepted by a lot of people
because it was unnatural.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it was unnatural, it had huge
safety benefits to people and eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: it became the norm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hope is that we can make some of
these become the norm.
[SPEAKER_03]: What 40 years ago was novel and new today
is considered mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do think the public does change over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They move out that far, but it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're at time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just hear some questions and then
we'll have Greg give my grand response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for the very wonderful
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question is about how do you think
the countries that are actually trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish policy frameworks, like the
GMOs, how in the presentation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: United Nations, how do you think they're
going to establish frameworks around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world in GMOs and how will they operate in
the T.E.?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm talking about the switch of
GMO or GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you make sure that at policy
levels, countries where people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to have the benefits of the
application of both technologies?
[SPEAKER_02]: In reference to what you were just saying,
I understand the public's hesitation with
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Science isn't always about this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come up with volumes of science
when we did the best we could,
[SPEAKER_02]: but science is not always, we come up with
products and they're not always
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the limelight, I mean, you can come
up with hundreds and hundreds of examples
[SPEAKER_02]: where we did the best we could at the
time, but there were unknown unknowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that speaks more to why are we
scared of some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it hasn't always worked for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do need some regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just religion or scared of
science, necessarily, but every once in a
[SPEAKER_02]: great while, we don't get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you address the question,
I want to check in with Geneva again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions in Geneva?
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions, thanks for asking.
Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to cover the second question first,
you're right, we have gotten something
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the public is willing to accept
mistakes when things are transparent and
people understand that science will not
get 100% correct all the time.
Some of the examples that I might give
where it really hurt the public is when
things have been hidden or people didn't
acknowledge some of those uncertainties or
[SPEAKER_03]: when things were bound to be problematic,
they didn't release that information,
[SPEAKER_03]: they held it back and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the public really becomes
very concerned about things in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I think the transparency
aspect is so key and critical to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think my view is a regulator or
the scientists can get it wrong,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if they were upfront about things,
the public will forgive them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they weren't upfront about it,
then they won't forgive it and it becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: a lasting kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my own view on it, but that's
obviously I forget the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Africa and for other countries,
if you don't have a regulatory system in
[SPEAKER_03]: place, so I think the ones I pointed out,
most of those laws and most of those
[SPEAKER_03]: definitions were done before gene editing
even existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're sort of applying an old law
to a new technique and we're getting gaps
[SPEAKER_03]: and ambiguities and not good fixes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody thought about when they made
those definitions that there would be this
[SPEAKER_03]: new technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing a law now, I think you
have to consider your definition and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can now understand these other techniques
and decide to include them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you're going to be conscious
whether to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you also have to realize even though
countries think that 10 years from now
[SPEAKER_03]: there's going to be something else new and
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're never going to be able to
predict what that is, but you don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to write your language in such a way that
you might not necessarily capture things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you might not want to capture in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to have some flexibility built
into that system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these definitions are pretty
inflexible.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are countries that write a
definition where they allow the regulator
[SPEAKER_03]: to exempt things and modify things through
regulation moving forward as techniques
[SPEAKER_03]: become more conventional, as people become
more comfortable, as a good regulatory
system should say, should put itself out
of business if after a while it's finding
[SPEAKER_03]: that everything is safe, it should be able
to deregulate those and do that through
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation without having to go back to a
parliament or Congress and do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we learn and we do better jobs
as we move forward.
