[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think it seems like potato week or
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks ago, one of my colleagues from
Potato Center, she was presenting and
[SPEAKER_00]: today I have an opportunity to talk to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am Awais Khan, working at Plant
Pathology section in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also, as Dan said, I am a new
faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started my position in October and maybe
some of these slides you might have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: during my interview presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the outline of my presentation is,
first I will briefly speak as Dan said and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has done a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be talking about my career so far
and then I have divided my presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: into two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First part is my work on abiotic stress
tolerance in potatoes and sweet potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: in Lima, Peru and then second part will be
my research and extension program at Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathology to look at mechanisms of
resistance in rosaceous fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as Dan said, I am from Pakistani side
of Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my bachelor degree in Plant Breeding
and Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I worked on castor oil plants,
safflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: After finishing my bachelor degree,
I went to University of GÃ¶ttingen in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany where I did my master degree
working on safflower, an oil seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I worked for ETH Zurich to work
on apples and there I worked on a
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial disease of apples called fire
blight and I will talk more about that
[SPEAKER_00]: work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I didn't stop my journey and I went to
University of York to work on a medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant called Artemisia Noa for my post-doc
and then later I came back to apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: rosaceous fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: In University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
where I worked on fire blight in apples
[SPEAKER_00]: and also I did some comparative genomics
in pear and other rosaceous fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2012, I think it was also October,
I joined International Potato Center as
[SPEAKER_00]: senior scientist to lead a global program
on adaptation in abiotic stress tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: in potatoes and sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, from October 2016, I am in
beautiful Geneva and actually these days
[SPEAKER_00]: and this week, last week, it's very nice
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can imagine, October, it was nice,
beautiful, fall colors and all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden, it was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, International Potato Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: International Potato Center is part of
CGIAR consortium and many of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about this consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This world's one of the biggest consortium
and there are 15 CGIAR centers globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some of you might know Simit
in Mexico working on wheat and maize,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas Erie in Philippines working on
rice and several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this similar way, International Potato
Center, the headquarter is in Lima,
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like other centers, the headquarter is
in Lima, Peru but there are several
[SPEAKER_00]: country offices and regional offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these regional offices are not only in
South America but also in other developed
[SPEAKER_00]: countries and for example, in Sub-Saharan
Africa, we had big office in Kenya,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nairobi, from where the operations in
different African countries were carried
[SPEAKER_00]: out and also in Delhi as well as in China,
in Beijing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said, the headquarter is in Lima,
Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potatoes, they originated in Andean
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Lake Titicaca between Peru and Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this country is very beautiful,
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has diverse environments from sea
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Pacific Sea, you can go up to
6,000 meters above sea level in the Andean
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potatoes can be grown along this whole
elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about sweet potatoes,
you can go to the other side on Amazonian
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest and you will see a lot of sweet
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's very interesting and interesting
country in terms of agroecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this slide is one of the key slide
which I want to make a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: point that headquarter of International
Potato Center is in Peru but you have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that country offices are in developing
countries and Sub-Saharan Africa are in
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Asia, are in South Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, potatoes, they are in Gene Bank in
Lima.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeding program is doing selections
in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of colonnally propagated
nature of these potatoes and sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, it's not easy to move this
material without cleaning and laborious
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplication and all those international
regulations to outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's very important to actually
evaluate them and to see what traits they
[SPEAKER_00]: have and how these traits are relevant to
the outside target countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, therefore it's very important to first
understand the target countries where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to send these clones or to have the
impact from the outside on these potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the level of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I was working in abiotic
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you have drought stress in Central
Asia, then you have to understand what is
[SPEAKER_00]: the drought stress in Central Asia when
the drought happens during the potato
[SPEAKER_00]: physiological growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on that, you select an
environment for your experiment in Peru so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you send this material to your
partners in developing countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very relevant or at least has some
relevance because sometimes you work with
[SPEAKER_00]: developing countries and partners and they
are not interested in research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interested in excellent clones,
the clones which can be released at
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have sent them some clones
which you don't know much about them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know about the performance,
then they will not be happy with you and
[SPEAKER_00]: this collaboration and future partnership
will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, therefore we were trying to first
characterize in depth the target
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where we are going to do the
experiment, where we are sending the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, the target stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on that, we were trying to
find the homologous environment in Peru to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing the same thing,
historical data on weather, on soil
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and all those features to find
these homologous environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, this is Southern
Peru, which is very dry, desert-like
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and also in highlands,
you can have the rains at certain points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to evaluate in these conditions,
it was very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we were trying to evaluate those
traits in depth in those experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: sites and evaluation of those clones
depends on the drought stress you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on, the abiotic stress you're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if I was working drought
stress, we were also looking at NDVI
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectance, chlorophyll content,
but also canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for canopy cover and also different
tools which we were using like
[SPEAKER_00]: thermographic images and so on,
we were trying to make evaluations so
[SPEAKER_00]: simple, the tools should be so simple that
if you're working with partners in
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries, they can also use
them with little technical expertise and
[SPEAKER_00]: also operational expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, at the harvest,
we were digging out the root system and
[SPEAKER_00]: also looking at the yield of potatoes and
then correlating these traits with the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits taken by different tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we were also interested
to increase the throughput and decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: the subjectivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were developing some methods using
drones and putting some sensors in these
[SPEAKER_00]: drones like Tetra-CAM multispectral
sensors, which we can take images in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drought experiment in three different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three different treatments, well water,
terminal drought, and also deficit
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these multispectral images were from
red, green to infrared spectral from 520
[SPEAKER_00]: to 950 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we were also looking
at metabolites, metabolite profiles of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants in these stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, for example, in a preliminary
experiment, you can see that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress-sensitive, drought-sensitive clone
and drought-tolerant clone, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds which show significant
difference between these two clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, proline, which is well
known, was showing significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were thinking to use near-infrared,
some easy methods to quantify them so that
[SPEAKER_00]: first, if we can find the metabolite with
these more technical methods, how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: use them in less technical methods in the
field in developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, if you're working on potato
and sweet potato and working on abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, if you don't look at roots,
and if you don't look at storage organ
[SPEAKER_00]: development, I think that is a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the young people, I will say that,
and I used to say, and I still believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to see another green
revolution, working on roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: underground traits is the way to go
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because above-ground traits have been
explored a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy to look at the traits
which are underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you do destructive sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of potential to be
explored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we started to do, we started to do
chevalomics like Jonathan Lynch says.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were digging out the plants and then
looking manual evaluations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in preliminary experiment,
we were able to establish that if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: root dry weight at 30 days in drought
condition, you have tuber dry weight at 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days highly correlated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means early root establishment could
be good indicative for later tuber yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gave us confidence, and we started
to look more in if we can do storage organ
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping in aeroponic system for
potatoes, or if we can do simple assay
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can let sprouts of potatoes to
make roots, where we can look at number of
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and also the elongation rate of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, there are three genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, six days, nine days,
14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can clearly see the difference in
the number of roots and also the speed
[SPEAKER_00]: they're progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things could be with the image
analysis software, as you can actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in these first few slides,
what I was trying to highlight that
[SPEAKER_00]: character is summarizing your target
environment, your experimental environment
[SPEAKER_00]: is the key, and the trait you're working
on is the fundamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have these two things
taken care of, then you can do genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be very relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For genetics, we had a mapping population,
not tetraploid potatoes, but diploid
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, simple genetics are simpler,
where we had a mapping population which
[SPEAKER_00]: was used to anchor genome sequence of
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a dense genetic map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used that mapping population to do
QTL mapping for drought stress in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and also in field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we identified several
QTLs for different drought related traits
[SPEAKER_00]: like NDVI and spod and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see from this figure is that
there are several traits which show
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity to specific environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you see QTLs in greenhouse,
but you don't see them in the field,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when you're working with
quantitative traits with minor effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will be very obvious for your traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some traits which were also
showing a consistency between greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also want to present you another
project which I had, and this project also
[SPEAKER_00]: shows you the complexity of the work which
could involve, and especially for colonial
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 370 clones from advanced
breeding population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project was funded by GIZ,
a German donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sent this to six locations,
and one partner in Germany was
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating for some other technical
aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these 370 clones were in all these
locations in three provinces of China,
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru, and also Kenya and Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get these clones in those environments,
it was one of the big hurdles,
[SPEAKER_00]: big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea was, and we were
actually, we collected weather data,
[SPEAKER_00]: soil data, and then the idea was that we
trained, and we actually trained these
[SPEAKER_00]: partners how to collect trade data for
drought evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were actually present in the sites
when the data was being collected,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we have reliable data,
the data goes back to the database,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have also genotyped these 370
clones to do marker trait association
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, and also to look at the extent
of G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project is ongoing, and there will
be very exciting results coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, I think, two, three slides for
sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research program was working on both
potatoes and sweet potatoes, and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: more funding for sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can imagine, from sweet
potato's importance for food security,
[SPEAKER_00]: health, and nutrition, many donors were
interested to fund this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to do abiotic stress research in sweet
potato, sweet potato was at a different
[SPEAKER_00]: stage compared to potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is, HECS applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other thing is, there are not many
research groups working on sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genomic and genetic resources were not
as advanced as you see for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this funding from Gates
Foundation, which is, this project is led
[SPEAKER_00]: by NCSU, North Carolina State University,
to develop genomic tools, which will later
[SPEAKER_00]: enable abiotic stress and biotic stress,
and nutrition quality research and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project had four, seven partners,
and from Boies-Thompson University,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have Lucas Muller for database,
and also Sangeun Fei.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the objectives, I was the lead for,
say, for four countries for this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working on genome sequencing,
and developing different populations for
[SPEAKER_00]: different objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we were developing
high throughput genotyping platform for
[SPEAKER_00]: HECS applied sweet potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also developing database with Lucas Muller
scope, and also tools for HECS applied
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping, like QTL mapping, genomic
selection methods, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this was proof of concept
objective, where we were actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping in multi-locational trials,
like you have a next gen Casaba project,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do QTL mapping and genomic selection in
this objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, which is very close to my heart,
was the training and capacity building for
[SPEAKER_00]: those partners in Sub-Saharan Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were doing webinars, web-based
courses, and also in-person training,
[SPEAKER_00]: short and also for PhD students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this project is making a lot of
progress now, and now I'm working here on
[SPEAKER_00]: apples, but this results are coming
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, genome sequence of
diploid-related multivac sweet potato is
[SPEAKER_00]: almost done, which is Sanjian Fei and
Robin Buell from Michigan State
[SPEAKER_00]: University, transcriptome sequence,
genome browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have very nice genetic map
algorithm developed, which is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: construct the map at HECS applied level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this paper is now in consideration for
publication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this slide maybe looks like closer to
the end, but I think this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing one has to think about when
you are putting a multi-location,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-year project with multiple partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have good system to put your
data in, there will be a lot of mess
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not be able to correlate
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think nowadays we collect so many
dimensions of our data, like transcriptome
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence, genome sequence, we have
metabolome, we have phenotyping,
[SPEAKER_00]: for so many traits, so setting up a
database is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was supervising database development
and tool development for database for
[SPEAKER_00]: potato center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is example from sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were not only looking at the tools
to collect the data, like smartphone apps
[SPEAKER_00]: and pocket PCs, but also the apps which
can be used to scan the barcodes and also
[SPEAKER_00]: then automatically you get an app in your
smart device where you can enter the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you plug it in with this central
database that it goes back there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you can relate different dimensions of
data and the environment data as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is again another very important
aspect when you are thinking of this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outreach and extension by this program
at HECS International Potato Center was
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily involved in training and capacity
building and outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say, I can divide into three
main categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: One category was building the capacity for
the partners who are part of your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they don't have the capacity to
do the experiment, you will not be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully complete your project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, in colonial crop,
if you're sending 370 clones to Ethiopia,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to see if they can multiply it,
they can keep it, they can propagation and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the cleaning of the material or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing and you have to help
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also when you're doing the drought
evaluation, you want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental design is coherent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also how the trade evaluation is being
done so that you want to make G by E
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you want to give or
one wants to give and we were doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: last year in February, we organized this
workshop in Peru, where we had colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: from James Hutton Institute giving
training to our national institutions in
[SPEAKER_00]: Peru for genomic editing, genome editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think building capacity of partners
of the people, the countries and
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions you're working in is very
important that when new tools come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are able to uptake them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sharing that you're well familiar
with this, that you share your results
[SPEAKER_00]: with the community, with wider community
who might not be part of your projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can give you excellent ideas for
research, as well as you can build new
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborations for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we organized first sweet potato and jam
genomics workshop at PAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was started last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I have so many collaborators
that I cannot list, you can imagine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of them are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to thank the team,
the excellent team I was able to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: at International Potato Center,
postdocs, research scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: research assistants, field workers,
and the people who were also waiting when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were harvesting that what could be
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take on the donkeys and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was quite dangerous sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I will finish my sweet
potato and potato part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will switch from palm the tear to
palm the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you must have realized my back
was hurting digging the potatoes and sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from October 2006, in plant pathology,
I'm setting up a research and extension
[SPEAKER_00]: program to look at mechanisms of disease
resistance in rosaceous fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, we think following four broad
categories for this research and extension
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first category I think we are putting
together different activities is
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding mechanisms of disease
resistance and characterizing mechanisms
[SPEAKER_00]: of pathogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also interested to look and develop
high throughput plant resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on these, develop tools for
accelerated and targeted development of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties with improved disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't think that I want to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with time, it will also get more
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will show you a few examples in the
next few slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I'm doing with time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I still have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the rose family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not good to pronounce rosaceous fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say rose family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to say rose family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rose family, I think most of you are
familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many fruits which are very close to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard apples, pear, peach,
plum, name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rose, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: They belong to this family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important from a commercial
point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also nutrition and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of its commercial importance,
genome sequence of several of them is
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many genomic resources are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: For many fruits in rose family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally, after China, US is the second in
apple production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in US, within US,
after Washington state, you have New York
[SPEAKER_00]: state and then Michigan state in apple
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I'm thinking that our
research and extension program will be
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on apples from rosaceous fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from plant pathology point of view,
these diseases, fire blight, apple scab,
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, and bitter rot, they are top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're important diseases for New York,
but also globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to focus on fire blight
and apple scab for this research and
[SPEAKER_00]: extension program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire blight caused by a bacteria called
ervinia myelovra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can infect apples and pear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can infect blossoms, shoots,
rootstocks, and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fire blight actually, it is easy to
recognize from symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see the plant which is infected
as burned by fire, dark tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first report of fire blight was also
from New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York in Hudson Valley in pear orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that was, I think, 1790s or late
1700s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, it has spread to almost
all apple producing regions with few
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we don't know what could be the
reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, in China, we don't have
reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Japan, we don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had at some point, but then there is no
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's another research question to
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, most of apple producing regions
have fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can kill the whole orchard within
weeks if you have aggressive strain
[SPEAKER_00]: present in your orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are control measures which have
been proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you can restrict the movement
of material from infected parts to
[SPEAKER_00]: non-infected areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been used in Europe a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural practices like pruning and
eradication of infected shoots and trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical use like antibiotics and copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological agents and host resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the host resistance, I think,
is one of the most sustainable and has
[SPEAKER_00]: greater impact on fire blight control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also very close to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the research program will be working
on host resistance heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is natural resistance in apples
against fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but most commercial sign and rootstock
cultivars, like Gala, Fuji, rootstocks
[SPEAKER_00]: like M9, M26, they're highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically, you can use this natural
resistance which is present in apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: breed it and have resistant apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in practical, it is not that easy
because of long juvenile phase of apples
[SPEAKER_00]: and cell phone compatibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you see it, and sometimes you
don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very sporadic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still have the inoculum in the
trees, but you will not see the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, markers such as selection,
developing the markers linked with trade,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then use them in breeding programs for
selection of seedlings is one of the ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to improve resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this slide, I think some of you have
seen it from my interview presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still didn't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that not only for apples and
rose seafoods, but in general for crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this could be a way to go forward
that you look at resistance mechanisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several ways to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do QTL mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do transcriptome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do several ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you have to look at
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pathogens, you can look at emergence
of new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at population dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One can look at mechanisms, how the
violence is caused by these pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on this information and this
information, then you are in a good
[SPEAKER_00]: position to develop resistance improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be either marker selection,
if you have candidates, genomic selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can do transgenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have option for that, or cisgenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also create novel
variations using genome editing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during my PhD, I did a QTL mapping
study where we infected the parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny of a mapping population and took
data after first, second, and third weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: after inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data we took is the infected shoot
and the total shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we calculated the percentage of
the infection and used that data for QTL
[SPEAKER_00]: mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, we also constructed the
genetic map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here what you see, a QTL explaining
38% of phenotypic variation was
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chromosome 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this QTL was not only statistical
ghost, but was validated in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this QTL is present, you can see
significantly less disease compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: when the QTL is absent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also a pedigree of this QTL was traced
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using the markers flanking,
the QTL was used in some other varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can see that if the QTL or the
flanking markers are present, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly less susceptible compared
to, they have less disease compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones which doesn't have the QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this robustness of this QTL
is heavily used in apple breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until now, there are more than 30 QTLs
which have been identified fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them have been validated,
some of them have not been validated,
[SPEAKER_00]: some have major effects, some has minor
effects, and some are from wild sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we are, and what as we have,
we also have a lot of markers from 1536 in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012 to 480K and EBS and dot sequencing
and several other options of markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at those two resources,
what I'm planning for this year is this
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third important component,
if you want to work with apples and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in Geneva, this could be one of the
best place to work with apples,
[SPEAKER_00]: beside those other resources I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a national apple collection in
Geneva, and also sign breeding program and
[SPEAKER_00]: also root stock breeding program in
Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got very, lucky to get this nine
populations from USDA collaborators and
[SPEAKER_00]: also from sign breeding and root stock
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grafted this on one standard root
stock, and then now these plants are in
[SPEAKER_00]: the greenhouse and the spouts are almost
getting showing, they're getting big now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also not sitting silent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are preparing the killer, the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are ready to infect them once the
shoots are big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing which I want to highlight,
which I learned also from the big projects
[SPEAKER_00]: from international potato center,
is proper labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple thing, but there could
be mix ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be later you have so many
dimensions of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are using, we are labeling all our
plants with barcodes and these barcodes
[SPEAKER_00]: are readable using a tablet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this tablet we have a field book
app, which is from Jesse Poland who was
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate from Cornell also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we can enter the data instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to write this on a paper
and then go back to the lab and do
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer this electronically again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a simple thing, but I think it
will be very helpful for us in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also another thing that one of the spots
of the population which was highlighted
[SPEAKER_00]: here in red, Jane O'Reilly, one of our
collaborators from USDA Kennesville and
[SPEAKER_00]: also Herbert Winkle, they shared some
phenotypic data on fire blight for three
[SPEAKER_00]: strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this data which was also in
field and greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking at the QTL map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to do QTL mapping for this
phenotypic data, the infection data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these three strands, WAEA273 and this
strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you quickly look at this heat map,
you can see that this strand seems very
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read this key, dark is 100%
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to this strand and this strand
for the same population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are expecting to have more than one
QTL segregating in this population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be strand specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very soon we will have some more
results to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm getting close to finish the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another very exciting project we
have started to do because being in Geneva
[SPEAKER_00]: again we have access to this big
collection of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This collection which is held by USDA in
Geneva, they have phenotypic data which is
[SPEAKER_00]: visual observation from one to five scale
for shoot blight, one being resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: five being highly susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look here, this is the
proportion of accessions in each species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every bar is a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these different colors are showing
proportion of each resistant or
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible class accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at these two highlighted
ones, which is Malus domestica here and
[SPEAKER_00]: Malus hevacei, the progenitor of apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just looking at the colors,
red being highly susceptible, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: that Malus domestica, domesticated apples
and Malus hevacei, the progenitor of
[SPEAKER_00]: apples, they have higher proportion of
accessions being susceptible compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the wild accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I had done actually evaluation in
my postdoc for a core collection which was
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping some of the accessions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data, although it's from field,
this data confirms that resistant are
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant here and susceptible are
susceptible here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, in a way, trust that a bit more
because of both greenhouse and this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that, we've done selection of
450 accessions to develop donor stock for
[SPEAKER_00]: novel strain specific and power spectrum
resistance for fire blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are five major QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be looking for the alleles
which are coupling with resistance in this
[SPEAKER_00]: 450 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we will be, we are hoping to
identify new alleles and new sources of
[SPEAKER_00]: future QTL studies and functional studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been also grafted and we are
now waiting for the plants to get enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough shoots so then we can kill
them or we can infect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also in collaboration with
several colleagues at USDA and Lance Carol
[SPEAKER_00]: Davidson for the Amplicon Sequencing
Markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also started to look at potential to
improve disease forecasting models.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can include genetics of resistance
in the forecasting model, can we improve
[SPEAKER_00]: that or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was also a good learning
exercise for me to look at New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we downloaded data from 51 stations for
this weather related parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my postdoc, she did multiple
co-inertia analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see based on this data from 51
stations, there are six different distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Island, Hudson Valley, Champlain
Valley, Finger Lakes, and also Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario and Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you see here is that,
for example, this is Finger Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also shows in this correlation heat
map some relation with other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to get historical data
for fire blight outbreaks to see that if
[SPEAKER_00]: this grouping based on weather parameters
and geography relates with the outbreaks
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will be able to actually
correlate this and get a better picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one slide showing that we are
also working with several other colleagues
[SPEAKER_00]: on different setting up several
preliminary experiments to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Sanjian Fei and Genaro Fazio,
we are working on looking at fire blight
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, which could be modulated by
Rootstock in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually today, I got a good news,
Matthew might be here or he's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got funding approval from ARDP for this
development of genome editing platform for
[SPEAKER_00]: apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this work will be done in
collaboration with Matthew Wilman from
[SPEAKER_00]: Transformation Facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with Larry Smart and some other
colleagues at Geneva in plant pathology
[SPEAKER_00]: and horticulture, we submitted a proposal
to develop high throughput phenotyping for
[SPEAKER_00]: fire blight in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we got funding, we will also start
working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to acknowledge
two of my post-docs who are brilliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent, and they are helping me to set
up the lab and also set up these
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the collaborators, which are
actually helping me to share their
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and also their knowledge on
different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is difficult to predict just what I
will say.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2014, there was a fire blight
outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, people were predicting that there
will be fire blight outbreak because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the weather and previous year in a column
buildup, but it was not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's not, there is sometimes
uncertainty to say and to predict,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are starting to tap into previous
historical data and also weather patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: and see, okay, if we can define and this
off prediction, if we can improve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, it is difficult for me
to say how, but varieties mostly they are
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inoculum is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is sweet potato auto or how is it
supported?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did you say you had deploying varieties
of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deployed relative of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still it's difficult to say that it's
the progenitor, but if you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogeny, it is one of the closest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why it's difficult for
sequencing also because of auto
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wheat is easy, three different genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, no, but we have interest
from also co-evolution point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the first report, I don't know,
I have to still dig more into the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature in that, but the first report
was in Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three native species from North
America and I think I don't have much
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but in the picture you saw based on
the field, field observations,
[SPEAKER_00]: those species, they show a high proportion
of resistant accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some interest to see that if
there is any kind of that this,
[SPEAKER_00]: first it was reported here, then maybe it
was transported outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to do that, sampling from those three
regions where these species are and then
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at genomics of that, yeah,
that's the interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, I'm using my startup
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
