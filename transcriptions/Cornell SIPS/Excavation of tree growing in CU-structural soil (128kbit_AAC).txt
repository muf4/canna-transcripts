[SPEAKER_00]: Over a period of seven years, we've been
observing terrific growth of these two
[SPEAKER_00]: London Plain trees growing in structural
soil, CU structural soil in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: For as long as we've been studying
structural soil, we've been very
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in how roots grow through this
new medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity here to actually
excavate the entire root system so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant this tree safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to do this because the trees
were planted under wires.
[SPEAKER_00]: This installation has about a 30 inch
depth of structural soil overlaid with a
[SPEAKER_00]: geotextile and then a sand setting bed
where pervious pavers are laid on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used an air excavation tool to safely
unearth the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see the roots in a quite a
strong growth pattern angrily moving
[SPEAKER_00]: around and through the structural soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots start at the surface but very
quickly move down in the profile going
[SPEAKER_00]: down to at least 24 inches into the tree
pit area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing both massive roots that tend
to go down, we might call those sinker
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, as well as large buttress roots
near the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we unearthed most of the root
system, we took it out of the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually transplanted it into a park.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree here was about a six inch caliper
tree and it had been planted about one and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half inches seven years earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been grown very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those roots were so deep we
actually had to break them to get the tree
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root mass that we took out of the
ground was about 13 feet long and about
[SPEAKER_00]: eight feet wide, so quite an extensive
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some massive roots, some really
strongly growing roots in the profile as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as quite a bit of fine root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some very interesting features of
how the roots move through the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly we saw some gravel that was
actually embedded in the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had actually grown around
encapsulating the stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again you can see some of the gravel
wedged in between the roots, roots growing
[SPEAKER_00]: right around those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a really good example of a
stone being encapsulated, actually a root
[SPEAKER_00]: growing around the stone, and it was
wedged in there quite tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As roots grow through structural soil,
they often get flattened and then proceed
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow normally again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This doesn't have any negative effect on
root function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw deformation, we saw
encapsulation, we saw a lot of deep root
[SPEAKER_00]: growth as well as roots that were up at
the top six inches below the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of evidence now that roots
can grow very, very well in structural
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and the hope is that as roots grow
deeper there'd be less potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: sidewalk heaving in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you you
