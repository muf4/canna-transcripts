[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everybody for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to talk about general
prediction, which we're talking here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe sugarcane is something we're
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of us that didn't see
sugarcane in the field yet, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugarcane, as you might know, is used for
producing sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another very common use of
sugarcane is to produce ethanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: both for human consumption and for cars
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens especially in Brazil,
which is the largest producer of sugarcane
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugarcane is grown in Brazil, the top
producer, followed by India and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite not being among the 10 most
planted crops in the world in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: area, it's the one that produces the most
in terms of total production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some more interesting facts about
sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a C4 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high polyploid species,
so it's actually the varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cones that we see in the field today,
they are hybrids from two polyploid
[SPEAKER_00]: species, saccharinococinidone and
saccharinococinium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also out-crossing, and it's a
commonly propagated crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to have some impacts on how
we manage the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's a perennial crop,
so harvest happens every year after a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing season, and then growers can get
an average of five harvests from each
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why to do genome selection for
sugarcane?
[SPEAKER_00]: So genome selection is being a tool that's
working very well with quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: traits, and those are the ones that are
interesting to sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also sugarcane has really long cycles,
actually being considered a cycle since
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that we do a cross until the time
that we can do a cross again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the traits that are
interesting are also quantitative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we went on to study how good
can genomes have and how action works for
[SPEAKER_00]: sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this overview of my presentation,
I'm going to start describing my data
[SPEAKER_00]: sets, both the molecular markers and the
field data, and then present the three
[SPEAKER_00]: main results that I have, which are
prediction for clones, prediction for
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, and then another way of looking
to the molecular markers in sugarcane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So field data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give an overview of the
breeding program in sugarcane in broad
[SPEAKER_00]: terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think the breeding program is some
selection stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with the first stage,
which is actually called a family stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: where families are planted together and
evaluated together for traits like bricks
[SPEAKER_00]: and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those families that are selected,
the plants that are selected are clonally
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated, and then we start having a
third stage, the initial plants are not
[SPEAKER_00]: only propagated, but then with larger
plots we can have a better phenotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this happens normally around two years
to move from one stage to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get to the third stage,
when we start having bigger plots where we
[SPEAKER_00]: can have measurements that we consider
important for selection like sucrose and
[SPEAKER_00]: weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see the performance of the
varieties in a better resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, here is still normally
on a single location, and then on the
[SPEAKER_00]: following stage, then there's further
multiplication where plants can be
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluated in different locations and
actually through many more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data that I'm using here comes from
CPC, as Mark mentioned, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugarcane Technology Center in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the overview of the headquarters
and also our breeding station that stays
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the north of Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some growing areas in Brazil,
the main growing areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go a little more in details
about my data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have data from two breeding cycles,
what I'm calling cycle 5 and 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: They follow the same scheme that I
described before, but on the third stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the actual phenotyping that I'm
going to describe on the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the following chapter, and then used on
the following ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the third stage, we got data that
were on all these traits, bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: all fiber and weight, and also sequencing
data from which we got SNP information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the molecular mark
information that we have come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: third stage, and we have two cycles to do
our analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just another statistics from these data
sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I'm showing the size of the families
in these third stage, and we see that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have some families that are pretty large,
but most of them are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be some imbalance in terms
of the families on the third stage due to
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take a look at the molecular
marker data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did sequencing for genotyping from
about 2,000 samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used the technology that uses some
probes to capture the locations in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genome that we are actually getting our
sequencing from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that, we got a raw data set
of more than 200,000 SNPs that later was
[SPEAKER_00]: further filtered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to a final data set with 55,000
markers in more than 1,700 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit more on the molecular marker
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in my initial analysis,
I'm going to consider the SNP information
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the presence or absence of the
lews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'm going to use a simple
representation where I get a distinction
[SPEAKER_00]: between the heterozygous state from the
homozygous state, only that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk more about the last
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the marker information,
we estimated a relationship from the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I'm going to show a broad view of
the relationship between the individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: based on a principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, actually, those three plots are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the colors that are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm showing here in the colors
are, first here, the cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the clones came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'm showing that there's no
particular difference between the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from the two certain cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, when I start putting
colors based on which female parent or
[SPEAKER_00]: male parent the clone came from,
you start to see a relation between the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors and the dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the structure that we can
see among those clones is more related to
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents that they came from,
then from the cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of makes sense when you see
how the parents were used in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some overlap between parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, even when the parents don't
overlap, they are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have pedigree information from
those clones that we use to estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships between the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm doing a comparison between
the marker relationships and the pedigree
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an overall correlation of 0.63,
not that high, between those estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are able to detect some outlier
clones that we decided to not use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: following analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they look like replicated
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's some mislabeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this comparison allowed us to do
this filtering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are 17 pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I'm going to show the first results
that are genome prediction for clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just explain what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we did a two-step analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step, we got blues based on the
raffinotip records.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then used those blues on the second
step as our raffinotip to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions together with the markers and
the pedigree information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using here only data from the stage
3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the linear models that are used
on the first step based on a point out
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had a term for the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we controlled for spatial
relationships between the plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a second stage, then you have the
linear model with two random effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's correlated using the
relationship derived from pedigrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: another from the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do a comparison later in
which I use one term or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's how we're doing our validation
of the predictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, there are going to be two
ways to compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in which I'm doing cross-validation
with clones from the cycle 05,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a larger data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so basically splitting the data
in 10 folds with six replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in another approach, we're going to
use the whole data set from cycle 05 to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the values from cycle 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, before showing the results,
I'm going to just present some broad-sense
[SPEAKER_00]: heritability estimates from the traits
that I'm considering here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to also use this to talk a
little more about the traits that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have the ones that I
mentioned, bricks, fiber, pole,
[SPEAKER_00]: and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were measured in some
combinations of conditions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a first harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a second harvest for the stage 3 data
set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have the two cycles that I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have two seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in both cases, half the population were
phenotyped on the beginning of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the early set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another half of the population in
the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the late season.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we have so little data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many combinations of the traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are basically considered as
individual traits in this analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the first results from crowds
validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, then we have the four traits,
bricks, fiber, pole, and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first and the second harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these bars, we have both early and
late traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that we have overall
prediction accuracy ranging from a little
[SPEAKER_00]: above 0.1 to close to 0.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is actually not a clear trend
between harvest 1 and harvest 2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: between early and late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot say that I can always predict
better for one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between the traits themselves,
in this particular case, there's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can see that fiber is a bit better
than weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this crowd validation, we're basically
separating the early and late sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another analysis that we can do is to
put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm showing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, by doing these, I increase
the training sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a larger population to do my
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can do prediction to both the
same individual sets, early or late,
[SPEAKER_00]: or then to predict them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, there was an increase of
prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is not a clear trend for all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in this case, it looks like
there was a big increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these predictions, I'm using both
the molecular marker and the degree in the
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have that full model with those two
random effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm comparing what I get when
predicting only using the molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: markers and then here only using the
pre-degree information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the dots here are the same
traits that I was showing on the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, the values are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accuracy is themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you see that there is a trend of
higher accuracies when using the markers
[SPEAKER_00]: in comparison to the pre-degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plot here, and this one,
basically the difference is that I include
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous result here with markers and
pre-degree and compare it with only the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look very similar, which means
that basically, what's driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in accuracy here is the
prediction from the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move to the other scheme of
validating the general prediction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm basically using the whole cycle
05 to predict the whole cycle 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we see a drop in prediction
accuracies for all of the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: In comparison to what we had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same idea here holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a clear trend between the
harvest and the early and late seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also include the early and late
seasons together for prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we get some cases,
especially here in fiber, where there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bump in the prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, it's actually a big
drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same comparison here now between
prediction using markers and pre-degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now then, it's not super clear a
distinction between.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a clear advantage for using
the markers in this comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some final remarks between these
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first paper that reported general
prediction surrogate was by Gui et al.
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had higher accuracies for
BRICS and stock number, which are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that we have in common here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I don't have stock number,
but stock number is reported to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: correlated to weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can trace a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, they had similar
heritability, but then higher accuracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is one important difference
between their study and this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the population composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in their study, they were using
varieties and clones derived from breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the main difference
between their study and this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we were doing a study based on
clones derived from an actual breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program during the selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that can be something to keep
in mind when thinking about implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: genome prediction in a breeding program
for a hurricane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some other comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regard to the prediction across
cycles, actually, we can see that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of GBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's not the best way to
compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expected to be a drop in the
prediction accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same way, here, it was interesting
to do this comparison, because it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like what we might observe when we
first deploy a hurricane in a breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program, if we also do the phenotyping of
the first selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you had multiple year data,
maybe could get some improvements in our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions and get a better clear view of
the trends with regard to the GBA that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with regard to whether to use
markers or the predegree for prediction,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could observe an advantage in doing
cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe this points to that if you used
these predictions to track the same
[SPEAKER_00]: families, then you would have a really
clear advantage for using the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we cannot do the prediction
for using the predegree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, move on to another topic,
which is focused on predicting parental
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'm using the same data set
as before, but instead of predicting the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone performance as I did, I'll look to
the parents that derived those clones in
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll estimate breeding values for them
and also the prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we're going to do a
single step analysis with all the records
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to put together data from
stage one and stage three.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, we're going to have a very
unbalanced data set in which we have
[SPEAKER_00]: parents that have from two to more than
200 records available in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the breeding values are going to be
derived from a very unbalanced data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because I don't have markers on
the parents for this data set,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the approach by Legara
2009, which used what we call the
[SPEAKER_00]: H-matrix, which is a combination between
the pedigree relationship matrix and the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker relationship matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it can expand some of the
marker information to the whole matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: using this approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a comparison here,
when I correlated the pedigree matrix to
[SPEAKER_00]: the H-matrix only on the set of clones
that don't have marker information,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting a correlation of 0.73.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remember before, we had a
correlation of 0.63.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still not super highly
correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of shows how one information
pushed the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my linear mix model.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of ladders here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I want to focus is on the term G,
which is the random effect for the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this random effect will use this
H-matrix that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, sometimes I'm going to use the
H-matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm going to use the pedigree
matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do prediction using the
H-matrix and then compare to the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: values derived from the A-matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I'm going to do prediction
across cycles again using all records from
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005 to form the training sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the parents that are only in
2006 as my validation data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have predictions in which
I'm using the pedigree matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pedigree relationships, the H-matrix,
and also an HW-matrix that I'm calling
[SPEAKER_00]: here in which I form the subset of the
data for which I have both marker and
[SPEAKER_00]: pedigree information with both matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in this case, there was a higher
prediction accuracy for weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, there was very little
increase for using the marker information
[SPEAKER_00]: and even a decrease when using weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another comparison that I did here was to
include in the observed data the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, which is kind of reusing the same
data that I'm using as training.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what brings the best estimates
for the breeding values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a big increase in
prediction accuracy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that actually the real
prediction accuracy that we might expect
[SPEAKER_00]: is not this high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be something here a little
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to show these results so to
have another information here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another comparison that we did was to look
to the parents and see if there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: full SIBs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we had a couple of families
in the parent's data set with an average
[SPEAKER_00]: of a bit more than five clones per family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did the same estimates of
correlation that we did before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now only looking to those full SIB
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we can still do a good
prediction for what weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a sharp decrease for breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tested actually the significance of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you might imagine, there might be a lot
of variation for this small number of
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the standard deviations here
are pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I do a t-test, it's not going to be
significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be interesting to do this
analysis again with a larger number of
[SPEAKER_00]: families or larger families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some remarks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, one interesting thing was
to use the progeny data to do our
[SPEAKER_00]: predictions in comparison to what we did
before, which was the data derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: the clones themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by doing that, we were able to
combine data from many states and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the mixed models allowed,
in spite of that, to analyze this very
[SPEAKER_00]: unbalanced data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a comparison between markers and
pedigree prediction, we can see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, we have probably a better use of
the marker information when you look to
[SPEAKER_00]: prediction within families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, in this analysis, we could use
this H matrix, which kind of makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to use two access information that
we might already have in the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program, but for which we don't have
marker information yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this last section, I'm going to talk
about something a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said in the beginning that shuriken
is a polyploid species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was only looking to the markers in a
very simple way, only looking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: presence or absence of the lius there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, we know that we might have
more information there because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this section, I'd like to explore a
bit more on the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a diagram that's very common to
see in shuriken presentations that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shows how the chromosomes in shuriken look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here, they're putting their colors
to each of the species that forms the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main thing that I'd like to
point here is that, yeah, we have many
[SPEAKER_00]: copies from each of the chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's polyploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we have like aneuploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different numbers of ploidy
levels for each chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, this might happen even
between clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I go to another clone, I should not
expect that these numbers for the same
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosomes to be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of makes things a bit
complicated here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm showing a bit more on detail
on what I mean by what's happening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might happen in shuriken,
not only the polyploid, but an
[SPEAKER_00]: autopolyploid, that we can observe markers
in higher dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might have things that we observe in
a diploid, like a single copy or absence,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also higher dosage of the alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, that's the kind of
difference that I'm missing in my previous
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that one question that we
might have is, OK, does it matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it matter, this dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might happen that after a dosage of
zero, it might compare to my traits of
[SPEAKER_00]: interest and increase the presence of the
allele in more copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might happen that it really matters
that as I get more higher dosage,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a higher impact on my trait,
or something crazy might happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, my point is if you don't
look to the dosage, we are not having the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to look to this.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it easy to look to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are reports in the literature
that explore this idea of looking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: marker information that you get from a
population and try to identify in sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: cane what's the dosage, even in the case
of alleles that appear in higher dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that it's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of cases that we kind of
don't see a clear result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here I'm kind of summarizing what
I think are the problems in looking to the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher dosage in sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing an analysis of markers
for dosage in sugar cane, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to know what's the dosage that we
have on a given locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the maximum dosage or the ploid
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know this information yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we could have an approach that
through the analysis gives this ploid
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is that sugar cane is a
highly heterozygous species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as other plants, we might observe a
lot of duplications of genes and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might happen that the signal that
we're observing here, I'm using signal to
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the molecular marker information that
we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be it, for instance, in our case,
the sequencing information from locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that signal to be really derived
from every single allele that we observe
[SPEAKER_00]: on the locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But due to heterozygosity, that might not
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you actually might get signal from more
than one loci together when we are
[SPEAKER_00]: clustering the sequencing information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some difficulties here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another is actually that we want the
signal information, the reads that we get
[SPEAKER_00]: from sequencing, in our case, to the
number of reads to be a function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, if we have narrow read
sequencing, that might be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to sampling errors, we might get a
different number of reads than what we
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect from the dosage inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do here is to try to
avoid some of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do an analysis that
simplifies how we look to the marker data,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to use the signal directly
without doing any of those fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: statistics analysis on the marker data in
which we find the dosage itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to show examples of this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to use that so we can test
this question that I made a few minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it to use the dosage
information when doing quantitative
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis in sugar cane?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a simpler analysis in which we
just look to the presence and absence of
[SPEAKER_00]: values, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't do better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to test the hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing is, OK, we do all these
analysis trying to find the dosage of,
[SPEAKER_00]: like as I showed in the literature,
of finding the dosage information from the
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe if we can test that the use of
this information is valuable, then it will
[SPEAKER_00]: give more incentives to follow on that
kind of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to do this through both
GWAS and genome prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building on the previous results,
we're going to do an analysis in which I
[SPEAKER_00]: have the markers on a simpler
representation, another in which that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't take into account the dosage
information, another that does,
[SPEAKER_00]: and compare the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'm going to reuse the
information that I got before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I'm going to explain what I mean
by another representation of the markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing in this table four data
points, four SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, I have read counts from both of
those alleles from these SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one case, for instance, I have read
counts from my reference allele,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not from my alternative allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my what I call discrete genotype or
discrete code, coding of the marker
[SPEAKER_00]: information, I'll assign a value,
let's say, zero to this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I have both alleles, I'm going to
say it's a one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I don't have one of the other
alleles, I'll say it's a two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what I did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this new approach, what I call a
continuous coding of the genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll basically get the ratio between the
read counts from the reference allele to
[SPEAKER_00]: the total number of reads that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will have something that's
continuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes from zero to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows me to distinguish cases
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assumption is that if I have a
higher dosage, I'll have higher read
[SPEAKER_00]: counts for that allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using this assumption, we use this
continuous genotype for the marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example of how that works in
the actual data that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm showing here one SNP and another
SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top, you have the continuous coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on bottom, the discrete coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the histograms from my
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had under discrete coding just the
values one and two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the continuous coding, these
values, that's the retrozygous,
[SPEAKER_00]: are in a range of values that go from zero
to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys here appear here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might be interesting because then
you get a higher resolution for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives access to information that
we didn't have before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing here one SNP that only had
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're working with a DPL,
this will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only have heterozygous individuals in our
proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ensure, can that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it happens in my data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I throw out markers like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a discrete analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between one and another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm going to do, I have two
matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: One I'm calling D from discrete and C from
continuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: With markers in both representations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the markers that are like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with extra markers that I didn't have
access to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had some samples that are replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did an analysis taking into account
that these are replicated and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared those two distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find an optimal read depth for
filtering these SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the optimal one is actually 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used some 50 just to not lose that many
SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still 50 to get basically a
non-significant difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using W, H is the D, C, and C2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a 50 analysis on the data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically the same, I'm showing here
the same stage three homes that I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that using discrete coding and
continuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we have 0.92 off diagonal
elements in those matrices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I look to the two matrices,
I actually have a lower correlation
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first you see kind of C is slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we have some extra
information that we didn't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to the actual tasks with this
tool coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do, so OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first the 50 plots from the draws
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, here I'm comparing the
continuous coding and the discrete coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a super clear difference
between them here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm showing that I might have more
significant loads on this side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do a Manhattan plot,
it becomes very messy, difficult to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: clear trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to compare actually the
continuous and discrete coding in a
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different manner, which is going
over a range of thresholds instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: using this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a range of thresholds, I count the
number of significant hits that I have for
[SPEAKER_00]: that threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here in this plot, I'm showing
the number of hits that we get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on red, I'm using the discrete coding
and on C, on green, using the continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a higher number of hits using
the continuous coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, actually, if you do this
analysis here, here I'm putting together C
[SPEAKER_00]: and C2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's there for the discrete coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more markers in this case for the
continuous coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this case, I just compare the C and
the D matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see we have a higher number of
hits in that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can look to both cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one case, we're getting more markers
due to the use of the C2 matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the markers that are not
polymarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if I just focus on the markers
that I have available already,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have an increase in the number of
hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to compare the modeling using
the linear model and the game model,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did the same range of thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I just checked from markers that
are not significant, so they're linear
[SPEAKER_00]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of them are significant for the
game modeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically because of the likelihood is not
directly comparable between both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see here an increase in the number of
hits, in 6% and 15% more in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of markers that we get from
only using linear modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also did general prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I used the G-blob modeling,
but also some other ways of modeling the
[SPEAKER_00]: data, RTHS, sport vector machines,
and random forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the results for genomic blob
in the four traits and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: matrixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's focus on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in most of the case, there are slight
improvements in using the continuous
[SPEAKER_00]: coding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when I use the C2 matrix,
I didn't show the numbers here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but my C2 matrix has only here we're
talking about around 50,000 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C2 matrix has 5,000 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have a high prediction
accuracy in comparison to the D matrix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not always, but in general,
there is a little increase in prediction
[SPEAKER_00]: accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: To include the other models for genome
prediction, I don't observe a real
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement between the different models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stick with the G-blob
results here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did a multi-kernel analysis to
combine the D matrix with the C2 random
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't, I'm not going to show
here, but it didn't improve much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some conclusions here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the use of this continuous coding
actually provided some gain in
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have more markers that were not fully
marked before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because of the relationships were
a little different, it looks like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting access to new information that we
didn't have before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual test in GWAS, we had more hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome prediction was about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not clear whether it was a real
improvement in accuracy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we can say that to use some
forms of dosage and coding in studies for
[SPEAKER_00]: shuriken might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we are actually
investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this study was, my PhD,
the whole program and the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything comes from CPC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had actually a lot of people there
that contributed to get the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine the field records and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Karine, Francisco, and Thiago,
they were directly involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing the framework for this
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also Michael Butterfield and William
Burkes, they were responsible for actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsoring everything here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to thank a lot of my special
committee, Mark, Jean-Luc, and Kim Vu,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially Mark, for accepting me here and
guiding through all those years and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting every step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'd like to thank all the sorrows
and the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They interacted a lot through those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I'm bringing this old picture because
I think I have some folks that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: here anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to especially mention Deniz
Eklemmer, Nick San Antonio, and Uch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear that we gave a lot of input
to my analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Running a little long, but I'll take a
question or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question about, so your
prediction between cycles, you talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about the common parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a subset that were used in both
cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if just from those original
predictions you did, if you ever look at
[SPEAKER_03]: the accuracy on the cycle you were
predicting just for the common parents,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you should be able to predict
within family better than just across the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're suggesting to use the parents
that I had in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to look at the accuracy, you used the
whole training population in the
[SPEAKER_03]: prediction, but then maybe you're
predicting so that when you correlate with
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole group, that's what you showed,
but just look in those common... I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually did that, just not showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a higher accuracy when I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super high, but yeah, it's higher
than that, significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have included that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a concern between when you look
at your dosage of an allele versus the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference in a read depth region?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking at a difference in whether
or not you have a read depth or whether or
[SPEAKER_02]: not you have a difference in dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, we would be looking to the
dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we actually have in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dosage, it's not the way it
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is we don't have access to that
information yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if we're gonna get a date.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to here actually not propose
that we should use the read depth as a
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still need to find a way to get
the actual dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I tried to do was to try to ask a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, is it worth it to look at that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually I had this question when
I got here and that's why all my initial
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis are based only on the presence or
absence of markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I went to do an actual dosage analysis,
probably I would be working with way fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: markers than I have now and actually it's
super complicated to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually not proposing to use this
kind of way, but can we still answer some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions by using another way to look at
the markers?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to cut this off, but we've got to
get back out there and harvest more.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking volunteers by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
you
