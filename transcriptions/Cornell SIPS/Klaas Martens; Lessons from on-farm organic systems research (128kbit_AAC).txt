[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Klaus, I'll turn it over to you and we'll
take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planned a little different direction,
but seeing what Matt has got, I threw that
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to do something more
complementary, but I do want to practice
[SPEAKER_00]: it with some observations that I've made
in general on farming systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, whenever we've had a major
pest problem, that could be a leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the perennials we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be an insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any type of a pest that it crops up in a
farming system can be seen as a problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, and that gives you a very
different solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the problem becomes, how do you kill
the pest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it can be seen as a symptom of the
direction that your system has gone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found more and more, and sometimes
it's not real apparent, but by introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the right new species to the system,
we can change the system so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't become the ideal host for what we
consider the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to digress a little bit because
we've got a perfect example that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: here at Cornell of this concept,
but it's with a little different crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's dry beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the early soil health tests came
out of this, where we were growing dry
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and then waiting five years and
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same disease complex that had been
in the roots of the dry beans was back,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost as if we hadn't rotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were blaming the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking for organic fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until Georgia Bowie took me aside once and
said, this problem is nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: your reactive stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with how you've been farming,
with what your system is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he explained was that we were
rotating to grasses and other legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other legumes were co-hosts to the
same set of problems that were in the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: bean roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, there were two problems
that were building up because of our lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the fungi, the pythium,
rhizoctonia, the fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other was pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which were opening up the roots and
creating a big highway for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens to move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever we had a wet spring,
in that situation, we had the roots rot
[SPEAKER_00]: off and a lousy crop of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: What George suggested was, why don't you
mix up your system a little?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring in some other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually the perfect slide for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the corn, we decided to shift gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: We frost seeded yellow mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow mustard has glucosinolates in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives off a cyanide gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bio-fumigates the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kills the pathogenic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also seems to get rid of the fungal
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a couple of years of changing
our system, our dry bean yields had gone
[SPEAKER_00]: from about 900 pounds to where we actually
had one field that produced 4,000 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of dark red kidneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On average, it doubled our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to add, and this would have been
early spring, we frost seeded,
[SPEAKER_00]: no tell, after corn in March, yellow
mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incorporated it in June when it was
time to plant the dry beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big concept here, I don't want to
belabor that particular practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to separate between systems
and practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a problem, and you described it
really well, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to have this mindset of I want to
add this really good practice to a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not compatible with the
system, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, we changed our system to
remove the reason that we had the buildup
[SPEAKER_00]: of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we try to create a system that
incorporates the rolled rye and the no
[SPEAKER_00]: tell, and again, this is a good example of
how do we reimagine the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're gaining quite a lot by
having more diversity in our farm by
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminating some of these pitfalls that
create pest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a piece of research that I
would love to see done here at Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: Penn State, or anywhere that they're
willing to do it, is I believe every
[SPEAKER_00]: species that we grow changes the soil and
makes it the ideal environment for some
[SPEAKER_00]: other species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it a terrible environment for
some, is probably neutral for others,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have this spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with herbicides, there's a
control spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to see some work done on how
these species interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put rye in to roll it,
my observation is that rye is either
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral or beneficial to soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely hazardous to some other
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, once I thought I had a great idea
and this was back when I first started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with Matt, of taking other
allelopathic species so that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the rye with no tell sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rye will literally kill sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most easily controlled
species for the effects that the rye has,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we call that allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're oversimplifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allelopathy is plant chemicals that are
given off by the roots, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: other modes of action that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant like rye that uses a lot of
nitrogen is also suppressing species that
[SPEAKER_00]: need a lot of available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every species has a group of microbes in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't have the right microbes in the
soil, then we're suppressing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's where we got in trouble growing
other legumes with dry beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were building up a lot of species in
the soil that made that soil not be a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy environment for the crop we were
trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this inner species type of research,
I think, could inform us in our no tell
[SPEAKER_00]: systems as to how do we use the cover
crops as a way to improve the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: for the intended crop, and then how do we
create it into a circle so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually optimizing the system,
using the right cover crops to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: desired conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few things that we've tried on the farm,
and I'm way out ahead of the science here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have to try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the high new things, the cake
observations, is we've noticed that if we
[SPEAKER_00]: put tillage radish in the fall with our
winter grains, that we actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: slight increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to two pounds of tillage radish put in
with winter wheat has given us an observed
[SPEAKER_00]: yield boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have noticed that when we've had
problems with the rolled rye, sometimes,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it improves soil structure,
if we've had really bad weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially bad weather when we
establish the rye, we've got some legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of not really great soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the planter not work as good,
makes it harder to get the seed placement
[SPEAKER_00]: where you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by putting the tillage radish in the
system, our theory is that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be penetrating the soil, loosening it up,
and actually mitigating possible legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the soil structure,
improving the soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's in at a population that helps
or is neutral to the rye, we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a better root situation for no
tilling into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen suggestions that maybe we should
be putting them in rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a really interesting
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm out ahead of where the
science is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to throw out ideas for Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drive him crazy with ideas before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I realize that it doesn't match up with
introducing Klaus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Klaus, can you just say a little bit about
where you're at and what you're farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Klaus Martens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're certified organic farmers for over
20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've farmed just an hour from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked very closely with Cornell
ever since, I can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the work that's been done
here, we've cooperated with and advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's been a very complimentary
thing, where observations made in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field are being tested here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finding that the research that is
being done, I'm going to put in a plug for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farming systems trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long-term organic farming systems
trial here was informed by what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening out on farmers' fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, it has been consistent
enough and has moved ahead far enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's going to start informing
what farmers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a real big benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been a synergy between
Cornell and the organic farmers in this
[SPEAKER_00]: region that has resulted in Cornell being
ahead of most of the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic research, but also the New
York farmers being ahead of farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: other parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talk at a lot of Midwestern meetings
where people come up and they're envious
[SPEAKER_00]: of us for living next to Cornell for the
kind of support we've gotten and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the research that has helped us
move ahead in our yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to drop that part of the talk
and go back to adaptive management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what you started
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go back to 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had planted 70 acres, which was a big
jump for us, of rye for roll down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, we were much drier
than Musgrave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three inches less rain during the
summer than Musgrave did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of a disaster in terms
of drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three inches of rain total from May
26 until the end of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had gone six weeks with under an
inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine what our no-till
soybeans look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually yielded only 200 pounds less
than the ones at Musgrave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could have done really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I did chicken out on our worst
field when I saw how dry it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided to harvest it as rye-ledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rye-ledge was a really profitable crop
because in the severe drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: forage prices doubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an adaptive management where
even though we had to change our plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were able to change it to something
more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, hindsight's 20-20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have done that with all of our.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of our fields, somebody had
grown hairy vetch once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a mixture of hairy vetch and
rye that was about 9,000 pounds per acre
[SPEAKER_00]: of dry matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff was over the hood of a big
tractor by about two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And imagine the forage that we could have
harvested on that instead of getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: piddly 900-pound crop of soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we followed that with,
and because this was our worst field,
[SPEAKER_00]: we knew that there wasn't enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't even plow that land that was
so dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we no-tilled sorghum sedan grass into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorghum sedan grass, it was a BMR sorghum
sedan, is able to tolerate much drier soil
[SPEAKER_00]: than soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually harvested our biggest and most
profitable crop off the poorest field
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had pulled a big crop of
chopped rye-ledge, and then we pulled two
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings of sorghum sedan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing you can get as much dry
matter as you do from a crop like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of adaptive management
really drives researchers crazy because it
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be replicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a seat-of-the-pants thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's opportunities that we can build
into a system like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by going from what would have been the
crimped rye to harvesting forage,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in sorghum sedan, we went back to
a winter grain, which made a good crop the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of those adaptive management
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another adaptive management tool,
and we've been talking with Aaron Silva in
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, is the system was developed at
about Route 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rye is crimped at the right time of
year to get the best soybean yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're at that latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really close to Route 90,
a little different latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about a 10-day discrepancy between
when you ought to be planting soybeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you ought to be rolling the rye to
terminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing in Wisconsin is just
planting the soybeans when it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant soybeans, and then crimping the rye
later when it's time to crimp the rye.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were coming into the severe
drought in 2016, we actually had plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: dry matter, and we crimped well before
amthesis to stop water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we had even the 900 pounds with
that really miserable drought was that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to stop much of the water loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we came back at about two weeks,
the soybeans were this high, and the rye
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting right back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took the crimper, and I tried
several different things, but we went in
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did no damage whatsoever to those
soybeans running over them, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: drilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were narrow rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't hurt them with the tires,
and we didn't hurt them with the crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to flatten and terminate
that rye going in the opposite direction a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple weeks later when it was amthesis
and it was time to terminate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just like to say that in our work here
with our different planting date research,
[SPEAKER_03]: four different planting dates in the
spring, our highest yields are always
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier than amthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're going in, we're getting
incomplete kill of the rye, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: Klaus is saying, and that's when we're
maximizing our soybean yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this idea of this threshold,
maximizing our biomass, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you say, that may work better south
of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're cutting into our growing season too
much, and we need to adapt so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: get that soybean in on time and just deal
with whatever we need to with the rye not
[SPEAKER_03]: being ready, either coming back and mowing
it again, or doing something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty consistent in our seeing
these higher yields earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of months ago, we brought in
somebody to do a program at our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about New York is too far
north, and all these advantages you have
[SPEAKER_00]: at Route 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this guy was growing organic,
no-till grains and vegetables in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be like being up north of
Toronto, far north of Toronto,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the latitude he was working at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed us some tools, some
techniques, and some ideas that were
[SPEAKER_00]: giving him extremely successful results,
far north of where it should be possible
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I met one of his classmates once.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been, he'd went to school in Germany,
and the professor was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till and saying organic no-till is very
successful talking about the Rodale
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but it can't possibly be done this
far north.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of these guys that you can
picture him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He popped out and said, well, I've been
doing it for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you love students that do that
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Jan Hendrik has done, he had
looked at what is it that tillage does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we achieve that without
tillage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those are really important
questions to frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of opens it up to more ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he was, his goal was actually to grow
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came up with the idea of transfer
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made some mental filters in his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were rules that he farmed within.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said one rule was, I'm not going to
import any organic matter from off the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within those rules, he would take cover
crop, like when you had the clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: if he didn't need it for mulch,
didn't need it for anything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would chop it and cover it to ferment
and would store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if he had beds, he would chop the cover
crop from between the beds and put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found that when you crimped and you
didn't have enough biomass to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds, you could bring in transfer mulch
to get up to the right amount of biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: and control the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing he found with the transfer
mulch, and this is the other thing tillage
[SPEAKER_00]: does, is it releases fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you till, you start a biological fire
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're burning up organic material and
releasing minerals that the crop that's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing hopefully needs at the right time
as when they're released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do tillage, that releases
these minerals not when the crop needs
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically recreational tillage and
you're putting stuff out there that either
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to leach into the water or the
weeds are going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the problems of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually increase weeds even though
it's a tool used to reduce weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started looking at how much mulch
does it take to control the weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, what composition of mulch do you
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What CN ratio?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what chop length?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what particle size?
[SPEAKER_00]: To release fertility in time with when the
crop needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those concepts really stretched my
thinking and he, along with these
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts, he said, well, let's look at
this crimper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use this, the organic matter
lasts the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a little discussion about the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, how about if I sharpen the
backside of those blades and put a hitch
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other end?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if he wanted the organic matter to
last as long as possible, he would run it
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he was in a hurry, if he wanted to warm
the ground up quicker and wanted it to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down faster, remember it's a cool,
damp environment where he is, he would run
[SPEAKER_00]: it in the other direction and it would
chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could speed up the degradation in
the breakdown by about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he got a machine that would,
actually it was a flail mower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little higher tech than the ones we
have here that would cut right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface and shred the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would increase the breakdown
speed by more than double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gave him some tools that he could
use to make those disadvantages that he
[SPEAKER_00]: had into advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason we can't be using those
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see some work done here
with what happens if we use this for
[SPEAKER_00]: chopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if we're crimping the second time
over, we ought to be cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be cutting the heads off late
enough so that we're not getting the grain
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm not giving you a whole lot of
answers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to throw out questions for
the researchers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're getting to the point
where we should probably shift gears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any questions for Klaus?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the major bottlenecks of
rolling is getting that time period right,
[SPEAKER_01]: not too early, not too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there efforts in plant breeding with
maybe widening that window?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that you don't need to go
into detail?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is a plant breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm involved in this legume cover crop
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also people are looking at cereal rye
and trying to look at earlier flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also looking at different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're looking at barley,
because it matures a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought we might really get in and deal
with it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just weren't getting as much wheat
suppression with that barley as we would
[SPEAKER_03]: with cereal rye.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are thinking about it and
approaching it in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding is one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we still have some work to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jan Hendrik was also using mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was doing prescriptions depending
on what you were going to plant afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it was going to be planted for
things that would be later or earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not just the mechanical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is work that's really compatible
with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the barriers to growers
implementing some of these practices is
[SPEAKER_02]: the cost of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've seen growers employ a mower
more expensive than the rotary mowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen people use the mowers as
mowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you done anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't run it with this on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't turn the PTO on, you just drag
it over the field.
Have you tried that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually tried coldemulcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done the mower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this was actually one of Jan Hendrik's
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he didn't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said a lot of farmers don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said just try things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coldemulcher did a great job for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this crimper isn't that expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till planters and drills can be rented.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good challenge for your
conservation district.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our county, the conservation district
had one for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are five of them in the area
that are for rent that farmers have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important to have the right
equipment, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try to do some of the work,
a planter, for example, in grain crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: corn and soybeans, you're trying to go in
with a standard planter that's not set up
[SPEAKER_03]: for no-till.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just going to be running into
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with a farmer who's got a brilliant
figure, and he drags it behind the row
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a neighbor who is a
brilliant no-tiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought an old single disc drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he waits until it rained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gets his cover crops to start as
nice as the people who spent $50,000 on a
[SPEAKER_00]: drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about a $1,500 machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he waited for conditions to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the soil was soft enough,
that single disc opened it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got a stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, Klaus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
