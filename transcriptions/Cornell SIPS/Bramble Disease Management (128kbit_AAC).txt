[SPEAKER_01]: As of raspberries, there's over 33 virus
and virus-like diseases reported on
[SPEAKER_01]: brambles worldwide and over 15 in North
America, but fortunately, only a few are
[SPEAKER_01]: common in eastern North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this presentation, I'll go over the
important features about virus diseases
[SPEAKER_01]: and discuss the virus diseases that I've
seen in Ontario, really just a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll provide information on how to confirm
a suspected virus disease and I'll end
[SPEAKER_01]: with information on how to control or
really prevent virus diseases on your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, what is a virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a virus is a microbe that can cause
disease, in this case, plant disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some viruses affect human health,
but it's important to know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses that affect plants do not infect
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses are quite different from the
fungal pathogens that cause many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bramble diseases we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, viruses are much smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only be seen with an electron
microscope and they're really just protein
[SPEAKER_01]: particles, not even cells, so they require
a living host and a cell in order to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and to multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses can move systemically in a plant,
so unfortunately, once infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant and all the plant parts
could carry virus particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike other plant pathogens, there are no
chemical controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because viruses live and multiply
inside plant cells, they disrupt plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cell processes, and this can cause many,
many different types of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the type of symptom that's expressed
by viruses depends not only on the virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can depend on the time of year,
the variety infected, and the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses present in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these symptoms include things like
crumbly fruit or yellow or spotting of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue, leaf curl, and low plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Virus diseases are often named after the
symptoms that they cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, raspberry bushy dwarf virus
is one of the viruses we'll be talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about virus disease is the
symptoms show up best in, tend to show up
[SPEAKER_01]: best in cooler weather, especially in the
spring and on newer growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the symptoms can disappear after a
while, but even if the symptoms on an
[SPEAKER_01]: infected plant go away, the plant is still
infected with virus and can still spread
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses to other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes infected plants show no symptoms
at all, and when this is the case,
[SPEAKER_01]: we say that the virus is latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, virus symptoms are often
latent on wild or alternate hosts for the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the most serious symptoms
that virus diseases can cause in
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries, and we call this crumbly
fruit or crumbly berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another symptom is leaf model or leaf
yellowing, and you can see here the
[SPEAKER_01]: irregular pattern of yellow and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite typical of herbicide
injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another symptom of viruses,
a very unusual pattern of yellowing that's
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with a virus disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pattern, again, is very inconsistent
and it's very variable in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this symptom can come and go and is
more commonly seen in the initial stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of infection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this symptom of virus disease is known
as vein clearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks a lot like herbicide injury,
but this is a raspberry plant in my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: These symptoms show up year after year in
the spring, and then they fade away and
[SPEAKER_01]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it's a virus disease
because I've never used herbicides in my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the fruit from these plants is
very, very crumbly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the last thing I need to define before
I get more specific about raspberry virus
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases is what is a vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses do not multiply outside of the
plants that they live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unlike fungal diseases, they don't
produce spores that are carried in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wind or splashed by rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And virus diseases need help to move
around, and they need a wound to enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the agent that spreads a virus disease
is what we call the vector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some virus diseases are spread by insects,
most commonly aphids and leafhoppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: or other pests with piercing, sucking
mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some viruses are spread by pollen or seed,
and these are very difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other viruses can be spread by
mechanical transmission that takes place
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's grafting or budding done on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are nematodes, particularly the
dagger nematode, that can spread viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now raspberry virus diseases are generally
classified by the type of vector that
[SPEAKER_01]: spreads them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I'm going to talk about these
three raspberry virus diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry mosaic and leaf curl,
which are spread by aphids, the tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: ring spot virus, which is spread by dagger
nematodes, and the raspberry bushy dwarf
[SPEAKER_01]: virus that's spread by pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start with the aphid-borne viruses,
there are two aphid-borne viruses which
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to occur in Northeastern America.
[SPEAKER_01]: These virus diseases are really important
in the Pacific Northwest, where they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of raspberries, and where aphid
populations tend to be higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the raspberry mosaic virus is also
found in the Northeast, but personally
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen the leaf curl virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: These viruses are vectored by aphids,
particularly the large raspberry aphid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is common in the Northeast,
but not abundant, and the small raspberry
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid, which hasn't actually been reported
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only hosts for both the aphids and
these virus diseases are raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this fact is very important when it
comes to controlling this virus disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: or aphid-borne viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now raspberry mosaic virus is really a
complex of different virus diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're all spread by the large
raspberry aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talk about raspberry mosaic or
the raspberry mosaic complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This disease shows up very often in black
raspberries, which are the most
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: In black raspberries, mosaic can cause tip
necrosis or dieback, leaf model,
[SPEAKER_01]: and reduced vigor and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: In red raspberries, which are less
susceptible, you may not see any symptoms
[SPEAKER_01]: unless there are two or more viruses in
the plant, two or more different viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, you'll get symptoms which
resemble leaf model or yellows,
[SPEAKER_01]: and definitely a decline in plant vigor
and small or crumbly fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disease is also present in wild
raspberries and often symptomless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So problems occur when aphids are spread
from symptomless hosts, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: wild raspberries in the nearby woods or
bush, and they bring the virus to your
[SPEAKER_01]: previously healthy planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the symptoms of mosaic virus in
black raspberries is tip necrosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growing tip blackens and bends and
dries up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another symptom of mosaic virus would
be this leaf model.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the yellowish spots on a
darker background, and this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: symptom is more easy to see in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant in this picture was not
confirmed as having a virus disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanted to show it to you as
something that could be a virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you see this leaf
puckering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's the arrow, the deep kind of
puckering and yellow modeling on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to control mosaic virus, and these are
the virus diseases that are spread by
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids, you really need to prevent the
aphids from moving from infected plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: non-infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, start new raspberry plantings
with disease-free stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means grown in a plant propagation
program that uses virus-free nuclear stock
[SPEAKER_01]: and tests for viruses throughout the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secondly, it's important to isolate
new raspberry plantings from wild hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should also separate black raspberries
from red raspberry plantings and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: because red raspberries could have the
virus but not have symptoms, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: more likely to spread the disease to
susceptible black raspberry plantings
[SPEAKER_01]: nearby before you even know you have the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: A minimum separation distance is about 500
feet, but a thousand feet or more would be
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: These distances are not foolproof,
but they are greater than the distance an
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid is likely to fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that aphids also spread in
prevailing winds and air currents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so if possible, you should think about
this when you're laying out a new
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be surprised to know that spraying
insecticides to control aphids is not
[SPEAKER_01]: really that useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because aphids can spread the
virus more quickly than they would be
[SPEAKER_01]: killed by an insecticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few examples when you might
want to control aphids to control viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll explain these later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, many raspberry varieties are
resistant to the large raspberry aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is particularly true of varieties
that are grown in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this aphid resistance is an important
way to control the spread of virus
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to find some examples of
aphid-resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the older cultivars like Newberg
and Latham are definitely susceptible to
[SPEAKER_01]: the large raspberry aphid, and so these
are very susceptible to mosaic virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas some other cultivars such as
Canby, Reveley, and Algonquin have this AG
[SPEAKER_01]: gene, which comes from a parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant breeders know how to breed for
varieties that have this AG gene and are
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore resistant to aphids and the
virus, but unfortunately, I couldn't find
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of information about this resistance
in some of our modern-day cultivars grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the next virus I'd like to talk
about, and this is the one that I see the
[SPEAKER_01]: most often, is the tomato ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attacks red raspberries and
blackberries, but not black raspberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently, and the symptoms can range
from none to severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spread by the dagger nematode,
so it's really only a problem in soils
[SPEAKER_01]: where dagger nematodes are found.
[SPEAKER_01]: In contrast to the mosaic virus,
however, which only occurs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry genus Rubus, tomato ringspot
virus can be found in over 35 different
[SPEAKER_01]: plant families, including strawberries,
apples, peaches, tomatoes, and many
[SPEAKER_01]: different broad-leaved weeds, so we're
going to have a different approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling this virus in raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the symptoms are variable,
a little unreliable for diagnosing this
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally associated with decline,
a crumbly fruit, a loss in productivity in
[SPEAKER_01]: infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in the onset of the disease,
you'll see distinct ring spots or foliage
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns on the primocane growth,
and these symptoms are known as shock
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms, and they show up early in the
infection or the year after infection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they may not show up again in infected
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another picture of crumbly
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was caused by the tomato
ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I see this virus most often
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the disease is spread by nematodes
from plant to plant, it does spread fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly in the field, infecting a few more
plants every year, generally up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: the row, because you're spreading
nematodes with your tillage equipment and
[SPEAKER_01]: farm equipment, and they're not moving
really quickly through a planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just another symptom of some of
the leaf pattern that I saw last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a field of Nova with tomato ringspot
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crumbly fruit that you've probably
seen, the fruit just breaks up when you
[SPEAKER_01]: pick it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to control tomato ringspot virus,
first of all, you need to start with
[SPEAKER_01]: disease-free planting stock, but the virus
could already be on your farm in one of
[SPEAKER_01]: its many weedy or alternate hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before planting raspberries,
you should sample soil for nematodes and
[SPEAKER_01]: control them if necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if dagger nematodes were present in
your soil samples, you would control them
[SPEAKER_01]: by soil fumigation, for example,
or growing an alternate crop for some
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see tomato ringspot virus the most in
planting sites, which were previously an
[SPEAKER_01]: orchard or pasture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure why, but these are
likely to have lots of the perennial
[SPEAKER_01]: broadleaved weeds that harbor tomato
ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So controlling weeds as well as the
nematodes can help reduce the incidence
[SPEAKER_01]: and spread of tomato ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the third virus is the raspberry bushy
dwarf virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vector for this is pollen from
infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this can be a very difficult virus to
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only attacks raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms again vary with the cultivar
in the season, and plants may or may not
[SPEAKER_01]: show symptoms each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a serious virus because it
causes crumbly berry in some cultivars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's associated with a decline in
productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the leaf symptoms we see
in the spring with raspberry bushy dwarf
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, I misdiagnosed this as
herbicide damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does look quite a lot like herbicide
injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another picture of raspberry bushy
dwarf on the Variety Qualicum.
[SPEAKER_01]: This irregular bleaching is less
consistent with herbicide injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a field of primocaine fruiting
varieties in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are infected with the raspberry bushy
dwarf virus, but the variety Autumn
[SPEAKER_01]: Britain on the left shows much more
distinct symptoms than the variety
[SPEAKER_01]: Caroline, which is on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, it's very difficult to control
raspberry bushy dwarf virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you should always start your
plantings with disease-free planting
[SPEAKER_01]: stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do see symptoms of this virus or
any of the other virus diseases,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should rogue out those plants if
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remove the infected plants and plants on
either side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few resistant cultivars to
raspberry bushy dwarf virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variety Chilcotin apparently is
resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a variety that's grown mostly in
the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very winter hardy in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are strains of the raspberry
bushy dwarf virus apparently, which can
[SPEAKER_01]: break through the genetic resistance of
these raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's always a little difficult to
diagnose virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to spend a bit of time on
that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there's a lot of symptoms
that can look like viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before you can be sure that you have a
virus or before you even test for viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should consider some of these other
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, past herbicide applications
would be good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should check out the nutritional
status of your crop with leaf and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis and scout for other insects and
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: This symptom is caused by herbicide from
glyphosate or Roundup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably seen it in raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: The symptoms show up the year after the
Roundup was applied or drifted onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the chlorosis and the yellowing and
the small stunted leaves could be
[SPEAKER_01]: mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: For virus diseases, potato leafhopper can
cause a leaf model or yellowing or leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: curl, particularly on the new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, a crop scout should find
evidence of leafhoppers on the lower leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tarnished plant bugs occasionally damage
the droplets when the fruit is sizing and
[SPEAKER_01]: the fruit can be deformed or poor
pollination, especially in the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: can result in crumbly or deformed fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen crumbly berry associated with
too low of a soil pH or inadequate crop
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some varieties are just weak necked
and tend to break up a little more easily
[SPEAKER_01]: than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if crumbly fruit predominates on a few
plants in your planting and more plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are affected every year, you should have
samples tested for virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you diagnose a virus disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need to use the services of a
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has greenhouse or lab facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two characteristic tests that are
done to test for viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most diagnostic labs will carry ELISA test
kits for the common virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you use an ELISA test, you need one
test for each known virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is the virus from the
infected tissue, to put it very simply,
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably not quite accurately,
the virus from infected tissue reacts in
[SPEAKER_01]: the presence of antibodies and added
enzymes, which are put in these little
[SPEAKER_01]: plates, in the little ELISA plates on your
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: More recently, PCR techniques or
polymerase chain reaction techniques are
[SPEAKER_01]: used to identify specific viruses or
groups of viruses by their genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: These tests are fairly expensive and
they're not done at many labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: PCR tests though can be used to detect
families or groups of viruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know the genetic code.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my whole point is really to identify
and confirm a virus disease, you need a
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnostic lab that is equipped to
diagnose the common diseases of brambles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a slide to show some of the labs
you could consider, depending which
[SPEAKER_01]: country you're in, to send some samples
for disease diagnosis or confirmation of a
[SPEAKER_01]: virus disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should pick a lab and then call first
to get the price list to find out what
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to cost, what viruses these
labs can test for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agdia is a very good lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's in Indiana, in the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well equipped to diagnose virus
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the website for Agdia has good
information about how viruses are
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a price list up there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other labs you might consider are,
if you're in Ontario, the Pest Diagnostic
[SPEAKER_01]: Clinic at the University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in New York, the Plant Disease
Diagnostic Clinic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's best to call ahead,
find out what virus kits they have on
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does get very difficult to ship
plant samples across the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in Canada, you need to use a
lab in Canada and the same in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use an American lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever lab you use, choose fresh
samples of plant tissue with symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that viruses are easiest to
detect in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the concentration or titer of the
virus in the tissue is highest then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at other times of the year,
you may be more likely to get false
[SPEAKER_01]: negative results and you should test again
the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my last few slides have to do
with controlling virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what you're trying to do is
prevent virus diseases from getting onto
[SPEAKER_01]: your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've said this already a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important things is to
start with clean planting stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't grow your own raspberries,
even though it may seem like an economical
[SPEAKER_01]: option at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A professional plant propagator will use
parent material that has been freed from
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses, usually through a combination of
heat treatment and tissue culture from the
[SPEAKER_01]: growing tip of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the screen house in New Liskard
where nuclear stock for Ontario plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see several features on this
building which are designed to keep virus
[SPEAKER_01]: vectors like aphids away.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's screened vents, double air locked
entrants and there's no weeds around the
[SPEAKER_01]: edges of this screen house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certified practices for nursery production
include growing plants in fumigated or
[SPEAKER_01]: nematode free soil, isolation from wild
hosts and regular scouting and pest
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your nursery growers, plant growers are
going to do a lot of extra steps to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the risk of viruses is very low
in their fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing you should do is try to
isolate raspberry plantings from virus
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know this isn't always practical,
but it should be in the back of your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And isolation slows the movement of aphids
from infested plantings to new plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really important for
controlling mosaic viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So separation from wild brambles,
older plantings and separating red
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries from blackberries is a rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third thing is to routinely identify
and remove infected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is known as roguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would scout for symptoms and remove
infected plants maybe twice a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this strategy can be effective when
less than 5 to 10 percent of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, if more than that is infected,
I guess you should remove the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: planting when it's no longer making money
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the one time you might control aphids
is before removing these infected plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from your planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a spray for aphids to kill the
aphids before you pull out the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: help prevent these aphids from flying on
to new uninfected plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already talked a bit about weed control
and nematode control as a strategy for
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling tomato ringspot virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember that many broadly believed
weeds are sources for this virus and that
[SPEAKER_01]: dagger nematodes have many hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I promised to talk a tiny bit
about aphid control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned it's not feasible to prevent
virus infection into new fields generally
[SPEAKER_01]: by controlling aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would have to spray far too frequently
and aphids can quickly transmit the
[SPEAKER_01]: disease to a raspberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spraying routinely for aphids is
something a plant propagator does,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not really something that's
practical on a field scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are a couple of times when
controlling aphids might be useful and
[SPEAKER_01]: this would be if you have an infested
planting and you want to reduce the rate
[SPEAKER_01]: of spread within that planting and the
other is when you're removing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, the references and
published literature on virus diseases of
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberry small fruit is somewhat dated.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the sources I used when
I was compiling this presentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but our knowledge of virus diseases is
changing, especially in the last decade
[SPEAKER_01]: and new techniques are being developed for
diagnosing virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that we all are going to
know a lot more about virus diseases in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future and in the years to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Pam.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one question from Tom Stevenson
about potato leafhopper and whether that's
[SPEAKER_04]: a concern for vectoring bramble virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not be a common vector of bramble
viruses that we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, there are some other
virus-like diseases, which I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss, known as phytoplasmas that are
vectored by leafhoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not common in the North East and
so it's not something I would be extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned about from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a caveat there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a caveat in that our knowledge
about the types of virus diseases and
[SPEAKER_01]: phytoplasmas is changing a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few people are working very hard in this
field and they're always discovering new
[SPEAKER_01]: virus diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Marvin has a question about the
importance of separating black and red
[SPEAKER_04]: raspberries and new plantings that are
established with virus-indexed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the assumption then is that you don't
have virus in your plantings and so do you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to separate them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to tell you the truth, I don't see a
lot of separation between red and black
[SPEAKER_01]: raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if there's a chance that
you're going to get mosaic virus from
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids from the woods or the bush or a lot
of wild brambles nearby, then the theory
[SPEAKER_01]: would be if you separated those from your
blacks, you would reduce the spread to the
[SPEAKER_01]: black raspberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the black raspberries are going to be
close to those wild sources too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good point, Marvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's one of those motherhood
recommendations that you would do if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could, but you might not always do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard that before, but I like
that description of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone else have any questions for
Pam while she's just finishing with the
[SPEAKER_04]: virus disease?
[SPEAKER_04]: No other questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know some folks don't like to type so
much, but I'll let you keep throwing up
[SPEAKER_04]: some questions while I change our
presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pam will be still here for the
remainder of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do think of something,
don't hesitate to just take your time and
[SPEAKER_04]: type it in there and that would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm going to introduce our second
speaker, who is Dr. Carrick Cox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cox has a program of tree fruit and
berry research and extension at Cornell
[SPEAKER_04]: University's New York State Agricultural
Experiment Station in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cox's program focuses on the chemical
management of fungal diseases of apple,
[SPEAKER_04]: stone fruit, and berries with specific
emphasis on the biology, ecology,
[SPEAKER_04]: mechanisms, and prevalence of fungicide
resistance in brown rot and apple scab.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he has been instrumental helping me,
certainly, and others in the extension
[SPEAKER_04]: field in New York with berry crop
diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I will turn off my speaker now and
turn it over to you, Carrick, and Pam,
[SPEAKER_04]: thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carrick, this is Laura.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think we're
having a problem with your audio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carrick, I'm sorry, this is Laura.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are having, I think, pretty severe,
I'm not hearing you at all, hardly,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other folks are saying that the audio
is cutting in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if I do high volume?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're good now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have your headset on?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hearing you now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you put your hands free, the little
toggle lock on?
That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can see because it's constantly
flickering.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't, and now it is on,
and now I do hear you, so hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like there's a slight lag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, why don't we move back to the
beginning of your presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were on a roll, and I couldn't hear
you at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to stop out and maybe,
now I'm not hearing you again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, I don't know why it's cutting
out on us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have had such good luck so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like I'm flickering, so let's go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say anything too terribly
important at this point, but we'll move on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the talk proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give a little bit of information
about understanding diseases of brambles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll talk about brambleroo
diseases and management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll look at root diseases in
2009 and some of the issues that seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be involved with a small fruit decline
this year, and what to do about diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: and root decline in 2010 given our
seasonal situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this talk is very much geared
so to the Northeastern United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, New York, where we've had some
very interesting weather, but I think some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those situations would also apply to
Canada, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we share a lot of the same overall
weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question in this section is
what are the difficulties root diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: present bramble producers in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they can be very frustrating in
established operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is that the most effective
management practices are preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting them in your already
established planting, this becomes a very
[SPEAKER_00]: big headache for producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even us extension people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, oftentimes they become parent after
the planting established.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone on several years and all of a
sudden they're beginning to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, unfortunately, the post planting
management practices when you're in these
[SPEAKER_00]: situations are less effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem to only really slow the
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, there is very little
one can do to cure the affected plants
[SPEAKER_00]: when the problem becomes fairly apparent
to both you and any extension person
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to visit your site as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very frustrating to
identifying diagnosed for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, these pathogens are soil
born, protected and hidden in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as Pam mentioned with the viruses,
these are things we're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to see very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not so much the fact that they
are small or microscopic, some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: very much so are, is that they are hidden
from view and we don't see them until
[SPEAKER_00]: they've already gone so far that there is
a point of no return for action in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of being a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the diagnostic symptoms are below
ground, which prevents recognition during
[SPEAKER_00]: a time when you might be able to take
action to save the planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, once the plant is dead,
it becomes a fungal decay free for all,
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing you or myself or any other
person visiting your farm from determining
[SPEAKER_00]: what actually is the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your key is to catch them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes, it's impossible for you to
find them early.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one good factor in all of this is that
the most common root diseases affect all
[SPEAKER_00]: berry crops and their management practices
are similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're not here specifically
for raspberries, a lot of the same stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about will apply to all small
fruit diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a diversified planting,
as I mentioned many of you might,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of what we'll talk about here will
be very applicable in all situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do a little bit of the
presentation on winter injury because in
[SPEAKER_00]: many cases, winter injury can mimic or
look like a root disease problem and be
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in brambles, winter injury is a
little different than in some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: small fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What usually occurs is winter injury
usually results from spring freezes in
[SPEAKER_00]: March and it usually kills the buds only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's less so due to winter
temperatures overall being just a cold
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need many days of lower than 20
degrees Fahrenheit before you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start killing primocanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the most part, when you see winter
injury, it may not necessarily be a root
[SPEAKER_00]: problem, but it may in fact look like a
root decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've read that may
cause trouble is if you do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent mulching, it could delay plant
hardening and then exacerbate winter
[SPEAKER_00]: injury problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not necessarily something you
can always be concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, in the case of winter injury,
any time a plant becomes stressed from
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, including root diseases or other
antibiotic factors like nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant is going to be more predisposed
to winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any time a plant gets stressed prior to
going dormant, you've just increased that
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of actually getting damage to
winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, that type of damage in the
form of primocane damage would be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more troublesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consequences, what will end up happening
is the plant will look reduced vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity, the fluorocanes will be the
most heavily influenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may break, but they may begin to
wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get death, but it's very
variety specific with very little specific
[SPEAKER_00]: information on the varieties that are most
impacted by winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnostic symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, as with other winter injury
symptoms and other small fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole plant may die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the case of raspberries and
brambles, what ends up happening is the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures warm, the fluorocanes will
appear to be wilt while the primocanes
[SPEAKER_00]: remain healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why this is, is that the buds on the
primocanes seem to be the most affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they burst into fluorocanes,
they'll begin to wilt due to damage
[SPEAKER_00]: vascular connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what one can see in these very small
pictures, one for my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diagnostic key is that you'll see a lot of
the newer fluorocanes looking rather
[SPEAKER_00]: weakened and injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: While the primocanes themselves look
fairly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can change the color to
something a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that they are dying at the tips and
all along that row while the primocanes
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves look quite fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's skip over a new slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canes can get killed to the ground,
but like I mentioned before, buds are the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary source of affected material when
it comes to winter injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't let it completely confuse you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that is interesting about winter
injury is that somewhat diagnostic,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will continue or will set up
new primocanes that stay healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if your plants are actually
suffering from a root disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will continue declining
throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: As will be more evident when we get right
down into the diseases themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more prevalent diseases in
small fruit and that for brambles as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a aquatic pathogen, which means it
basically lives as an underwater organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's dried out, it's simply just
surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it likes wet soils and
low-lying areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are all very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other interesting features of
Phytophthora is that it prefers cool
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and cool weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can be a problem if we have cool
springs and cool summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what will happen is you'll get some
stunting and chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You begin to see the chlorosis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the chlorosis just simply meaning
a yellow spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, wilt and death of plants in
patches as the soil begins to warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's a nice patch of really
wilting and dying plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to diagnose a raspberry,
let's say you're seeing wilt and death in
[SPEAKER_00]: patches and you're planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see whether or not it's
Phytophthora or something completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the wilting plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't pick a dead one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, once they're dead,
it becomes a fungal free for all and you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be able to tell what's actually
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dig it up, remove the soil from the root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have Phytophthora, you'll notice
that many of the fine roots and lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: roots will have rotted away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have all the nice bushy fine
root material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut through the crown and the large roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what you will see, if it's completely
white underneath, you're going to be fine
[SPEAKER_00]: like this piece here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you begin to see a reddish
chocolate brown portion with a sharply
[SPEAKER_00]: delineated white area, you will begin to
note that that is very suspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get these chocolate red brown
sections, but it will be sharply
[SPEAKER_00]: delineated with a white, a slightly white
section like right there at that margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very indicative of Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you might suspect that
you're planting had a Phytophthora problem
[SPEAKER_00]: and that those patches have dying plants
was indeed due to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, wet spots and low lying areas
are also going to be dead giveaways as
[SPEAKER_00]: well or suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to consider is that once your
plant gets killed by Phytophthora,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Phytophthora infected propagules
are going to hang out in that dead tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of them will get into the soil
and remain dormant until you have those
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures of cool weather and water and
will cause infections in later seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have those planting that was
killed or destroyed by Phytophthora and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you remove the plants, bear in mind
that those propagules are still going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be waiting for you the next time you
replant and they can last for quite some
[SPEAKER_00]: time, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, select a site with a
well-drained soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use raised beds if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something I always see in
raspberry production, but if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, it would be something that would
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, since it's an aquatic
pathogen, as much irrigation, artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can avoid, would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could minimize the water,
that is the key to managing Phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: root rot, at least culturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, select an appropriate variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are differences in resistance among
raspberry varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they are not often well-known and
would be best served by looking in your
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery catalog for which varieties claim
to have some form of resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how large or minute it may
be, and picking one like that if you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a planting with a lot of
low-lying spots and potential wet spots or
[SPEAKER_00]: a field that's historically more wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things you can do chemically to
manage Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, these are only going to work with
good cultural management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to grow these things
hydroponically, it won't matter how much
[SPEAKER_00]: fungicide you spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora, if it's present,
will still overwhelm the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the materials is called methanoxum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called red mill gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually involves an autumn soil
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there is a strong propensity for
fungicide resistance development to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are some newer,
softer materials that are actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: effective against Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliette, profite, phosetrol, these are
phosphorous acid biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: These you can apply in early spring and
late summer to the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do do a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, they were used for a while
to manage sudden oak death in California
[SPEAKER_00]: with aerial applications and fairly
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually a good alternative to
the hard core fungicide if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'd like to change gears and move to
the next disease that one can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vascular disease, meaning that it
ruins the vascular tissue and is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up causing a wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever the vascular tissue is hampered,
you can expect that plants will begin the
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pathogen on many hosts,
including a lot of weeds and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, it's the black raspberries
that are usually most heavily impacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to a lot of literature,
I've seen the red and the purple appear as
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole to be less susceptible to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, but I would not exclude them
from having the possibility of getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fortunate thing is this has some
distinct above ground symptoms and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is easy to identify in not only
in brambles, but other small fruit crops
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when it disrupts vascular
function, it's kind of like not giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be stunted, wilt, and you can kill
or verticillium can kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms and diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will end up happening first is the
young canes will wilt first from the base
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petioles will remain attached and the
older leaves will look scorched.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the older leaves down
here at the base of this cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, they are sort of crispy,
torn up, and messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, some of the younger leaves at the
top are, you can still see, are green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's a more severe situation
where everything is scorched at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the older leaves are pretty much
ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: They almost look burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you can also find in cases
of severely infected canes, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: bluish spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might notice that this spot is a
little pale brown or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this area here is a little more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bluish indications may be an
indication of verticillium infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't necessarily the best picture of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, black raspberries have
bluish casts to their cane, which makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look for spots, and there are better
pictures, but very few on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: show this situation very carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got better in strawberry,
but this can be something to look for.
Management.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you do about verticillium wilt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this is a difficult one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pathogen can survive in soils after
weeds and vegetables for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a resistant structure called a
sclerotia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hide out in the soil waiting for
you to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: After purchasing a tomato, a field planted
to tomato, eggplant, peppers, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you plant after many of these hosts,
there is a possibility that you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it may not always be practical
to wait three years, but it's something to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider if you have a planting declining
and it was planted after one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including things like stone fruit trees,
which are rather strange, but may be
[SPEAKER_00]: present in a diversified farm in the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Pam mentioned on many instances,
it's very important to use verticillium
[SPEAKER_00]: free planting stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your planting stock has a little blue
splotches throughout on your black
[SPEAKER_00]: raspberries, it's maybe you not want to
use that one or consider that there could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a problem with it before planting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, there's no complete
resistance, not like flat out immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, the red and purple
raspberries appear to be less susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're coming in after one of these
other crops, you may want to consider a
[SPEAKER_00]: red or a purple raspberry variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fumigate, but fumigation has
become impractical in recent years due to
[SPEAKER_00]: cost and many of the legislative
guidelines under which it must occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that's done that often
and it's something I believe that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should get away from doing for
environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk briefly about crown soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the other diseases that one
may find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vascular tumor disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what's happening in this case
is a soil-borne bacterial pathogen is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing tumor-like growths on a root
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it will disrupt the vascular
function, causing the plants to appear to
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get stunting, wilting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to be as productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, if you get one of
these, it will predispose you for winter
[SPEAKER_00]: injury because the things occur at the
crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the type of winter injury occurring at
the crown is not something that one wishes
[SPEAKER_00]: to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, these are sometimes fairly
easy to find if they actually occur at the
[SPEAKER_00]: crown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's two pictures from the berry
diagnostic key.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to find or determine whether you
have this problem, look at the base of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canes and crowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, dig up a root system if you
don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what will happen is on the lower
crowns and stems and roots, one will find
[SPEAKER_00]: these tumor-like growths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can highlight that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a dark color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eventually will get old and the
bacteria will be released as they decay
[SPEAKER_00]: and enter into the soil again,
which causes problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in these instances, there your little
tumor-like growths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that's the cause of the
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, as I mentioned before, they will
disintegrate sometimes after they are
[SPEAKER_00]: formed over the course of heading into
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they release the bacteria into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to keep in mind is this is a
common disease problem in stone fruit and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially grapes in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crown gall and grapes is fairly prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're planting in land after one
of these two situations, there's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility that you could be planting in
the soils that have this bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if you see planting stock with
galls or odd growths on the roots or
[SPEAKER_00]: crowns, don't use it by all means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, take care after planting after stone
fruit and other grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're finding old root systems with
galls and bumps on it, you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider planting somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, avoid practices that
injure the crown and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this bacterium does is it's in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any injury near the crown and roots
that occurs in contact with the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if the bacterium was present,
can be the site of the gall formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, in that one picture we showed a
while back of the raspberry crown,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was probably some sort of injury
that caused the bacteria to infect and
[SPEAKER_00]: begin its tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opposite situation is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even winter injury and insects can wound
sufficiently to cause an infection for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even a little bit of winter injury and
insect pressure, if it's too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: can predispose you to this disease if you
have soil with the bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, with crown gall,
there's not much you can do chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to be very careful in how
you set up your plantings and the planting
[SPEAKER_00]: stock you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, I'd like to quickly talk
a little bit about root diseases,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, or some of the things that we had
run into or possible problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions being is what role did root
diseases play in plant decline in the 2009
[SPEAKER_00]: season?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't look like many of you
experienced this, thank goodness,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a lot of it in diversified
planting, so I thought it pertinent to
[SPEAKER_00]: address.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we do to prepare for root
diseases and plant decline in 2007?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they commonly index for crown gall and
small fruit nurseries?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a fairly rare disease,
and you don't see it that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that any nursery that saw
the diagnostic symptoms of it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the soil, much less so in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants would likely be clean
unless they were bringing it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated soil, and I imagine that they
would spot and not even sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if they specifically do
it, but I imagine by just common quality
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, they would see it and remove
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a lot of reports of small fruit
decline, especially in strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some in brambles and raspberries as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, these all happened in the
late season, and in many cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: decline progressed to a point where it was
difficult to confirm root disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we did find several indications
of verticillium wilt and phytophthora and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, winter injury, so that was
somewhat surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last three years of my appointment,
we've seen very few instances of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 2009 was especially a bad year for
becoming aware of these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the spring was fairly dry and
cool, not too unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the June-July months was really
wet, a lot of rain, many inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: rainfall, and the temperatures were cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've noted for monitoring weather for
other diseases, it was an extremely cold
[SPEAKER_00]: summer, and many of you probably realize
this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have cold conditions and a lot of
water, it might have made a very favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: situation for phytophthora, and it may be
that in many cases... Yes, according...
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe I'll answer that question
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're almost done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many instances, if you have cool
conditions and wetter, a lot of wetness,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will run into problems with
phytophthora, and this may explain what
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do to prepare?
[SPEAKER_00]: The conditions were very favorable for
root disease in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a lot of high levels of
inoculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you didn't have any root disease
decline last year, the situation may be
[SPEAKER_00]: prepped for having enough inoculum such
that if the conditions exist, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get a root disease problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you thought you had decline in 2009 or
had a lot of wet spots or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: unthrifty plants and it was in a wet spot,
some of those situations that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive for phytophthora, you may want
to consider putting on a spring
[SPEAKER_00]: application of a phosphorous acid product
as a preventative measure for managing
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora in potentially affected
fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a head start on it,
you will be able to potentially manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the disease begins to show up later in
the season, and you can finally see it
[SPEAKER_00]: without digging it up, it's usually too
late to do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year it may be pertinent to use a
preventative application of a phosphorous
[SPEAKER_00]: acid product if you have fields in which
would or could develop a phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low lying, wet fields, or fields with a
lot of wet spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you went through the last 2009 even
without a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there could be increased winter
injury in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your raspberries had a lot of
foliar diseases towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, you know, even things like leaf
spots and rust and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: anthracnose, this may have predisposed you
for winter injury as you enter dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is make sure that your
plantings are well insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring, scout frequently for the
signs of declining plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use this handout to determine
whether or not you have a winter injury
[SPEAKER_00]: issue or potentially a root disease
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can recognize the cause of this
early, you can take action to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, many of the diseases you can't do
much about, such as verticillium and crown
[SPEAKER_00]: gall, but these are less likely to have
simply emerged over the course of two
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this would allow you to get a handle
on things such as phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, looks like we already have a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a primocane is mowed down in the winter
and the canes get broken by the mower,
[SPEAKER_00]: will this increase susceptibility to crown
gall?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bacterium is present in the soil,
mowing would be an excellent way to injure
[SPEAKER_00]: your canes to provide a source of
infection for the crown gall bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you've been mowing for many
years and have never seen it, then it is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely the crown gall bacterium is not in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Karik, I was wondering if you had any
opinion about Actinovate as a preventative
[SPEAKER_04]: approach to verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used Actinovate in other cropping
systems, particularly on tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a considerable measurable
success in getting it to manage diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: that are also fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very hesitant to recommend any
fungicide used for verticillium wilt
[SPEAKER_00]: because usually the pathogens in the soil
and the Actinovate just bring it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could in theory drench it if
it is in coordinates with a label,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I imagine getting it through the soil
to the plant, to the site where the
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium would be is kind of a stretch
with any fungicide, including Actinovate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a soft product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see some of these others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can Phytophthora root rot kill a plant
within one season?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine if it got going,
you could lose an entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will look wilted, unthrifty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may or may not die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how robust your planting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a long-established planting,
it may be able to outlast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the Phytophthora is going to be
there waiting for it next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mode of action for the phosphorous
acid products involves the phosphite ion
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually directly lethal to the
Phytophthora pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there has been a lot of work to look
at the phosphorous acid and the phosphite
[SPEAKER_00]: ions effect on other fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't appear to have a strong effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phytophthora is not actually a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a aquatic organism in an entirely
different kingdom, but it seems to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to the phosphite ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a product like Alliette has to go
through several breakdown steps in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, while the newer phosphorous acid
products can kind of skip the middleman of
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown and go straight to the ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the ion becoming available,
it seems to be what damages the
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Stevenson has a question about whether
or not nursery is commonly indexed for
[SPEAKER_04]: crown gall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that's something that they're
aware of and would see, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if they specifically have an indexing
program for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it would be something that would
show up as a catch-all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt they would think, oh, no,
my raspberry has nitrogen-fixing root
[SPEAKER_00]: nodules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that's something that would flag
very easily in a quality control
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, and it's mostly in the soil,
not necessarily, you know, it can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants, but I imagine they're growing
their plants in very clean soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless it was a really sloppy
operation, I imagine they would catch
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know of any that have a
specific crown gall indexing program.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Alan Baker has a question about
fall red raspberries that bloomed and set
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit buds, but in mid-October had a
killing freeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have any idea if that will have
any effect on the season's production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if the buds are, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Marvin's microphones are probably
not on, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Alan, those must be like a
heritage, a primocane berry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a killing freeze is not good,
but I think here's Marvin and Jeff typing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I would think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shouldn't be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff has a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Setbacks or separation of crops if it's a
mixed vegetable and berry farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would keep my, obviously the
peppers seem to be the poster child for
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as long as you don't plant
them immediately after peppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any of those other vets, or tomato,
I think you'll probably be fine in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of worrying about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, phytophthora can get in all those
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a phytophthora problem in a
field and you're planting next to it with
[SPEAKER_00]: your raspberries, that could be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'd want to do is make sure that
water doesn't drain from the infected
[SPEAKER_00]: field to the field of your raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will carry the phytophthora.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, that would be the,
if you can separate them by water source,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can eliminate a lot of the disease
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you don't plant in the same area
where you've had a problem in a vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we usually recommend like a three-year
rotational separation using, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: unrelated crops or a cover crop or
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is indeed what is on the
verticillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommends for many places, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wait three years, even after stone
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certain weed crops, if you have a
heavy weed, infestation, it can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pigweed and horse nettle,
some of those others.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of them, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple more people typing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke over again, how much is too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're starting to see flooding
or if you can pick up the soil and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a lot of moisture on your hands,
that may be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if your plants are wilting from
drought, you need to irrigate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Testing farm
[SPEAKER_03]: Karek, did we lose you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking at Jeff's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we test pond water's use for
irrigation for phytophthora?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone does that
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you'll see it in there so
much unless you have a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora other areas in your
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would necessarily be a
good use of your time necessarily to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to test that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best use of your time would be to see
declining plants and quickly pull them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and look and see if there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or take a healthy plant that's near your
irrigation and make sure it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: those nice chocolate areas with delineated
up against white tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that extra plant as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you folks think of a couple more
questions for Dr. Cox, and thank you,
[SPEAKER_04]: Karek, so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, there's a little bit more time
that if you do think of some questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's lay them out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of more poll questions
that I'd like to introduce just quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to open it up and ask everybody
to please vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's 34 of us logged on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a grower, I'd love it if you
could join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Armed with the handout of this
presentation, knowledge of my own
[SPEAKER_04]: operation, and abundant free time,
I could probably determine the cause of a
[SPEAKER_04]: bramble decline, could definitely
determine the cause of decline,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably couldn't determine the cause,
and still couldn't identify the cause nor
[SPEAKER_04]: what to do about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to get some feedback from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that handout that Dr. Cox mentioned is
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download it onto your computer,
and we'll give folks a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had about 20 growers or 22
growers that were present.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to see that many folks voting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pam Fisher is still with us,
so if anybody has any virus questions,
[SPEAKER_04]: please type those in.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can address them now as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 17 people, a couple more folks maybe
if they could vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess not, so I'm going to close this
poll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have one other, hold on,
I just got a locked in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One other pod to poll to ask you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully people can see this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to make it bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if people thought this was
helpful to the management.
[SPEAKER_04]: The presentation, helpful to your
management of bramble viruses on your
[SPEAKER_04]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we could get about 17 or 18 people
to vote, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys very much for participating
in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank unless, oops, there might
be somebody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there is another question for Pam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is puckering of leaves more associated
with viruses versus other diseases,
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam or possibly even Carrick?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you guys could weigh in on that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, go ahead, Pam, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may just probably be killing some of the
faster growing cells, some cells remain
[SPEAKER_00]: growing while the younger ones are being
killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes a misshapen development on the
areas in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what viruses do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kill cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some are more impacted than
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam, you have an idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not hearing her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bungi rot things, so they don't
necessarily cause stunted individual cell
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, something's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I didn't have my mic on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think if you're trying to compare
them to leaf diseases, then there are
[SPEAKER_01]: things that cause puckering, like cold
temperature damage or mechanical damage
[SPEAKER_01]: that just makes the leaf grow more quickly
in some parts than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of the other fungal diseases that
attack raspberries, I don't think they
[SPEAKER_01]: work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are great answers to that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little trickier.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to encourage, if you do have
any other questions, now's the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to draw your attention one more
time to these handouts that you can upload
[SPEAKER_04]: onto your own computer in the file share
box.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this concludes our bramble
disease management webinar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to draw your attention to our
final bramble and the entire Cornell Berry
[SPEAKER_04]: webinar series.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be held on Wednesday, February
17th.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the bramble insect management
webinar.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Dr. Don Johnson from the
University of Arkansas talking to us,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as Dr. Hannah Barak from North
Carolina State University.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're very happy to have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really appreciate everybody logging
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to just encourage you folks,
if you do not get the email from me the
[SPEAKER_04]: day before, please don't hesitate to
either call me or email me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll make sure it gets sent,
the connection information gets sent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something is happening in the last couple
of rounds with the bulk email to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are not getting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And mark it on your calendar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't see it, don't hesitate to
contact me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll send it individually to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I appreciate, again, our speaker's
time and expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you all for logging on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
