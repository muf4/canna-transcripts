[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Thanks, Larry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to start out by introducing the
people in my group that have actually been
[SPEAKER_14]: working with hemp diseases.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll tell you what I think about hemp
diseases.
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, Jamie Cummings is here,
who has been with my program for a number
[SPEAKER_14]: of years.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's now with the IPM program,
but kind of got us started on some of our
[SPEAKER_14]: hemp work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kevin, you want to raise your hand there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Kevin Myers.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now Jen Starr is my research and
extension support specialist.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I'd really like you to know is
when you're out in your hemp fields and
[SPEAKER_14]: you're finding things you think may be
diseases, if you notice something,
[SPEAKER_14]: say something, let us know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Get in contact with one of us,
and we'd like to diagnose the problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like any other new crop, there are a set
of pests, insects, weeds, diseases that
[SPEAKER_14]: will be eventually a problem in the
production of that crop.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, this is the second year out
with this new crop in New York State,
[SPEAKER_14]: unless you go way back.
[SPEAKER_14]: It might have been grown previously.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in recent history, it's all new to us.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that includes the plant pathologists
that are working on this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So with our one year of experience last
year under our belt, we saw about a dozen
[SPEAKER_14]: different microbial organisms that we
found that caused disease on hemp.
[SPEAKER_14]: And these vary everything from things that
cause a rotting in the root system that
[SPEAKER_14]: can affect the seedling establishment of
the crop, to things that cause a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: fungi that cause spots on leaves,
of lighting on leaves.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we saw things also in the buds,
in the heads, the flower parts,
[SPEAKER_14]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Very often we found something we would
call gray mold, the botrytis, a fungal
[SPEAKER_14]: problem, infesting the buds.
[SPEAKER_14]: But by and large, the message is that most
of the industrial hemp that we've seen has
[SPEAKER_14]: been pretty darn healthy.
[SPEAKER_14]: As you may know, and you're gonna hear
more about today, there are different
[SPEAKER_14]: classes and uses of industrial hemp from
the CBD types to the grain types to the
[SPEAKER_14]: fiber types, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're gonna hear about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's a lot of different genetics
out there in these fields.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure Larry and others are gonna
talk about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that means there's a lot of diversity
in the crop that brings about a
[SPEAKER_14]: corresponding diversity in the microbes
that cause disease.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're definitely seeing in some of the
CBD types more of a susceptibility to some
[SPEAKER_14]: of the leaf spot pathogens, for instance.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not going to try to clutter your
minds with a lot of Latin names of
[SPEAKER_14]: microbes today.
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, what I'd like to leave you
knowing is that we're trying to get an
[SPEAKER_14]: early handle on these things eventually.
[SPEAKER_14]: What we'd like to see is working with
Larry is to try to make selections in
[SPEAKER_14]: these different classes where he's doing
the breeding and seeing if we can't
[SPEAKER_14]: increase the level of natural genetic
disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which would be our first line of defense.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're all aware and you will hear
from others here today that because of its
[SPEAKER_14]: status as a non-crop officially at this
point, there are none of the FIFRA labeled
[SPEAKER_14]: materials for control of pests.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that includes diseases, even things
like seed treatments that Alan's gonna
[SPEAKER_14]: talk to you a little bit more about.
[SPEAKER_14]: But eventually we hope as the
classification of this crop moves along
[SPEAKER_14]: from the federal government to kind of
keep up with what's going on at the state
[SPEAKER_14]: level that we will be starting to look at
different kinds of pest management
[SPEAKER_14]: materials including synthetic chemicals as
well as organically approved materials for
[SPEAKER_14]: organic production.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now the best thing we can do is
start out with some sound cultural
[SPEAKER_14]: practices.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you'll hear this over and over
again today, rotation is our greatest
[SPEAKER_14]: friend.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's less likely to be disease impact
if you grow in sequence fairly unrelated
[SPEAKER_14]: crops.
[SPEAKER_14]: So hemp being a broadleaf crop,
probably its best rotational crop partners
[SPEAKER_14]: would be things like small grain cereals
and corn, the grasses, the monocots.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some commonality in some of the
pests, especially across some other
[SPEAKER_14]: broadleaf crops.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna learn more about that as we
go.
[SPEAKER_14]: But one of the biggest problems we have is
white mold.
[SPEAKER_14]: And anybody that grows soybeans or
vegetables is well acquainted with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so a rotation with soybeans or some of
the more susceptible vegetable crops is
[SPEAKER_14]: probably not the greatest choice because
of susceptibility to white mold.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're learning other connections like
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the disease organisms some of the
bundled leaf spots are very specific to a
[SPEAKER_14]: particular species of plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's not so much of a problem
there, the rotational sequence of crops.
[SPEAKER_14]: But looking at variation in the varieties
and the cultivars of industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_14]: some are gonna be more susceptible than
others.
[SPEAKER_14]: So as we go along and working with Larry
and his program, I think we're gonna learn
[SPEAKER_14]: more and more about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, my message to you here today is
if you see something that appears that
[SPEAKER_14]: might be disease, we're in the business of
diagnosing that and trying to get a handle
[SPEAKER_14]: on it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd love to work with you.
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.
A
[SPEAKER_13]: couple minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions for Gary?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we have a laboratory in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know, maybe we can put that on
your website too.
[SPEAKER_14]: That might be the easiest thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just put more diagnosis of plant
diseases.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can put that on the website.
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, my email is gcetree.cornell
.edu.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that's probably the best thing
we could do is put something on the
[SPEAKER_14]: general Cornell hemp website.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be glad to give you a card too today.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the question here is,
do we have a listing of varieties and by
[SPEAKER_14]: diseases about relative susceptibilities?
[SPEAKER_14]: And quite honestly, we're so early into
that cycle of trying to understand that,
[SPEAKER_14]: that we kind of have a shopping list of
things we have seen.
[SPEAKER_14]: But to partition it out that finely,
we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, this is a very dry,
warm, early part of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see how that ends up.
[SPEAKER_14]: But up to this point in the growing
season, there has not been an intensity of
[SPEAKER_14]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had very hard to find any at all.
[SPEAKER_14]: So good news bad news.
[SPEAKER_14]: But last year, we catalogued quite a few
different pathogens.
[SPEAKER_14]: As far as which ones are going to become
really severe.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's still a lot of guesswork.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not really an extensive world
literature on this, interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're very much in the learning mode
here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So question is a good one about if we used
any kind of inhibitors, natural products,
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever, the soil biome itself.
[SPEAKER_14]: The short answer is no.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's a lot of possibilities
there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But with the learning curve, we're here
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: But those are some of our aspirations as
we move along with this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I might point out that this,
I'm sure Larry will, that we're not in
[SPEAKER_14]: this by ourselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are 35 other states.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question was referring to
connecting with the State Department of
[SPEAKER_14]: Environmental Conservation.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are in quick communication with the
DEC.
[SPEAKER_14]: But really, even above that, there are no
EPA permits.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no national permits for use of
any of these plant disease control
[SPEAKER_14]: materials.
[SPEAKER_14]: So even before it got to state regulatory,
there's nothing allowed.
[SPEAKER_14]: Now there are some things that are on the
grass list that are used for food
[SPEAKER_14]: processing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe you're going to deal with that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe Alan can talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are some materials that might be
useful in certain things.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in general, we don't really have any
tools in our arsenal right now for disease
[SPEAKER_14]: or insect control.
Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, maybe we can talk about that a little
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be here.
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I want to make sure I got in
a little bit late.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you came in late, this is the handout
that I'm going to be going through.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's extra copies up here if anybody
needs those.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of eating grits.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just raise your hand if you'd still like
to have a handout in this, if there's some
[SPEAKER_15]: people in the back.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm based here at the Hague Experiment
Station.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm getting used to saying that right
now as we've been at the New York State
[SPEAKER_15]: Hague Experiment Station for the past 130
or so years.
[SPEAKER_15]: But my area is in seed science and
technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my nature of my program, but also my
own interest, is kind of to work with new
[SPEAKER_15]: crops, especially those that are going to
have really a benefit for New York State.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that they have this really one
that fits into that, where there's many
[SPEAKER_15]: seed challenges.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is really a new crop, as Gary talked
about in his presentation.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some things we kind of expect.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some things that we simply haven't
ever worked on.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't look up somebody else's work to
really know that much.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're really trying to establish some
really sound science, that applied science
[SPEAKER_15]: can be translated into outreach and
extension to benefit our New York
[SPEAKER_15]: agricultural community.
[SPEAKER_15]: If we kind of, how did we get here?
[SPEAKER_15]: If we look at the 2014 farming bill,
it allowed states to go ahead and to work
[SPEAKER_15]: on research on hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: Several states have done this.
[SPEAKER_15]: New York really got into this in a big way
last year, and even bigger way this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: I contacted Ag and Market, and we're
looking at 3,200 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: That are planned to be grown here in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_15]: This side of the Mississippi, some of the
major states, Kentucky, North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_15]: and then you go to the mountain states of
Colorado, the largest in Oregon and the
[SPEAKER_15]: west coast.
[SPEAKER_15]: So quite a substantial industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also learned a lot from other
countries, in particular our neighbors to
[SPEAKER_15]: the north.
[SPEAKER_15]: Canada has over 110,000 acres,
so more of a mature industry there.
[SPEAKER_15]: There we can rely on for seed companies,
for getting plant materials as far as seed
[SPEAKER_15]: sources.
[SPEAKER_15]: So in your picture, probably if you've
already been growing hemp, you know what
[SPEAKER_15]: the seeds look like.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you actually put a seed on top of the
crop, this is about the actual size of the
[SPEAKER_15]: seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just one of the commercial lots
that was used extensively last year in
[SPEAKER_15]: some of the farmer trials called ANTA.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did not adulterate the photo there
on the left.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just a huge range of seed sizes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're working with any other
crops, if you work with field crops or
[SPEAKER_15]: vegetable crops, you know the seed
companies have done a much better job of
[SPEAKER_15]: sorting seeds by size.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's have the first thing is that we
deal with a regular shaped seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've done enough work with those small
seeds, they're really just produce front
[SPEAKER_15]: plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're really just really good.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're kind of just there, part of the
seed count, but they're really not that
[SPEAKER_15]: productive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, starting off with those small
seeds, my goal in working with Gary's
[SPEAKER_15]: program is we're trying to be proactive in
looking at seed treatments for the future.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the 2018 farm bill, as we look at that
one, if all goes well, hemp should be
[SPEAKER_15]: exempted from the DEA, which is really
going to open up a floodgate for having it
[SPEAKER_15]: being grown just as much as any other
vegetable or field crop.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would also allow pesticides.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to be proactive in that and
looking ahead.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you working in the vegetable or
specialty crops area are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_15]: IR4.
[SPEAKER_15]: IR4 works with university partners and
others to foster the registration of
[SPEAKER_15]: materials, both chemical and biological
organic.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so IR4 already has a program.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're allowed to work with hemp.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a program now at NC State on weed
control.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're kind of trying to get our
foot in the door for next year,
[SPEAKER_15]: for 2019.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one part of that is besides the
different materials that we'd be applying,
[SPEAKER_15]: either chemical or bio pesticides,
is how we're going to apply that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So my laboratory has done a lot in that
area.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we use our standard kind of a slurry
technique, that's what the grain is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're getting materials on the seed
and the color, but you can see a lot in
[SPEAKER_15]: the uniform.
[SPEAKER_15]: So try to spend some time kind of
upgrading the seed technology.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so now we can see with the proper use
of different seed coating materials,
[SPEAKER_15]: we can get a very uniform end product.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really what we can lead to as
we're going to be moving into that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, kind of working to try to establish
ourselves with the IR4 and work with that
[SPEAKER_15]: entity for many years.
Again, looking at chemical seed treatment
for direct seeding, but also to look at
bio pesticides.
Organic materials.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of next year's
presentation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, just kind of looking ahead for
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to change gears now into seed
testing, seed quality management.
[SPEAKER_15]: Standardized testing procedures are in
place.
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been in place for many years,
as it is for other crops, field crops,
[SPEAKER_15]: using a roll towel test.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're looking at two samples of hemp,
and these are from testing samples.
[SPEAKER_15]: We had 23 seed bottles.
[SPEAKER_15]: That are being used with field soils this
year.
[SPEAKER_15]: And my laboratory did both germination and
the purity.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll talk about the purity in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you can look at that photo,
you can see the ones on the left.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very poor germination, lack of uniformity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the photo turned out pretty well,
but there's just a lot of mold growth,
[SPEAKER_15]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there can be actually internal
soil-borne pathogen soil-borne diseases
[SPEAKER_15]: within the seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it's going to kind of
proliferate.
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, kind of another need for having
effective seed treatment in control there.
[SPEAKER_15]: What we'd like to do is have what looks
like the roll towel on the right-hand
[SPEAKER_15]: side, with very uniform seedling,
high germination potential.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's go over to the second page of the
handout.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are already AOSCA, which is the
official certification agency for the US,
[SPEAKER_15]: already has this minimum established
standard for what the seed bottles look
[SPEAKER_15]: like.
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one you always think about is
germination.
[SPEAKER_15]: So the minimum germination has to be 80%
higher.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other aspects are what we
call purgatives.
[SPEAKER_15]: One pure seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: The inner material, which is just broken
seeds, other trash material, other crop
[SPEAKER_15]: seeds can be present, wheat seeds,
any of those, would distract from having
[SPEAKER_15]: pure seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are already thresholds
established there.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we're looking at here are those 23
seed lots.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've ranked those from high to low
germination.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see, we're all over the board
as far as germination percentage.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those germinations, again, using 80% as a
threshold, we only have a little over 50%
[SPEAKER_15]: of the seed lot would even pass
certification standards to be planted as
[SPEAKER_15]: we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have a few other areas over here
that are highlighted in red on the purity
[SPEAKER_15]: side.
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, the other crop seeds exceed the
certification standards, other wheat seeds
[SPEAKER_15]: that are present.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we just took these seed lots as
representative, we only have a little over
[SPEAKER_15]: 40% of the seed lots would even pass.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this industry, which is somewhat better
than the underground industry,
[SPEAKER_15]: really needs to raise itself up just to
put itself to have, to make certification
[SPEAKER_15]: standards.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's kind of one of my take home
lessons here is that the seed quality can
[SPEAKER_15]: be good with that because that has to be
poor seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you have other crop seeds,
inner material, wheat seeds, that you open
[SPEAKER_15]: up that bag of seeds when they're there,
that is really something that seed
[SPEAKER_15]: companies can easily clean out with seed
conditioning equipment.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we really need to have really improved
seed lot to really improve the standards
[SPEAKER_15]: of potential for this crop.
So at this time, I'll just open it up if
anybody has questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I publish it on purposes because some
of you are CBD people.
[SPEAKER_15]: All these varieties are for fiber or for
grain.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've not done the testing aspect on the
CBD variety because of limited seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to promise that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is another big issue.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes sir, you have a question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so basically what are our standards
that we use?
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is official standards for seed
testing adopted by the acronym called the
[SPEAKER_15]: AOSA, the Association of Official Seed
Analysts.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the same type of a criteria that our
state seed testing laboratory would use in
[SPEAKER_15]: Albany as well as other states.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are criteria as far as
temperature in which to seed the test,
[SPEAKER_15]: the duration of the test, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're really providing prescribed
methods that we're following as far as
[SPEAKER_15]: what this germination and the period of
test are done.
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk more about this if you have
other questions.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, they're already established.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_15]: So as far as what I would call an
industrial crop for fiber or for grain,
[SPEAKER_15]: we may have for next season as early as
next season.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, that's very optimistic that we have
some of these materials that's already
[SPEAKER_15]: used on field crops.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it would be more of a seed treatment
rather than a field.
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't think of like a seed pellet and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're really just looking at a small
amount of the active materials.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, they could be biological in nature.
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, both the organic grower and the
conventional grower could use those.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where the chemical type, which would be
just for conventional type of production.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the way it is in crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, it's the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: We gotta get the 2018 Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gonna have to go through where hemp
is exempted.
[SPEAKER_15]: That will open things up.
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, what Gary and I are trying to
strategize is try to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of going on this year.
[SPEAKER_15]: What is feminine seed and how are they
doing it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Why isn't it working?
[SPEAKER_15]: For those of you involved in CBD
production, you have an option.
[SPEAKER_15]: It depends on what the seed company is
providing is feminine seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: You want our feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, is you want to have the plants
that you are producing only to produce
[SPEAKER_15]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: You do not want to have those produce male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hemp seeds are naturally what we call
dioecious.
[SPEAKER_15]: Means they have, there's male plants and
female plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: What we want for just the flower
production, where the CBD production would
[SPEAKER_15]: be the highest, is those that only produce
female flowers, as we have harvested yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: The feminized seed part of that is a
particular method that needs to be done
[SPEAKER_15]: during the seed production to produce
those feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where you're using different materials,
silver materials, things like that to
[SPEAKER_15]: change the sex expression.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, think of it in our own
chromosomes with XX and XY.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hemp is the same type of plant species
with XX being female, XY being male.
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, is you need to have XX pollen
to produce the seeds, to produce the
[SPEAKER_15]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a rather specialized company.
[SPEAKER_15]: These seeds are extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you working in them could be a
dollar or so per seed.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an expensive type of an operation,
but one that you would have that high
[SPEAKER_15]: level of very, very high quality.
[SPEAKER_15]: High level of female plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: The other way is if you do not have that,
or if the procedure is during seed
[SPEAKER_15]: production, still gives you some males.
[SPEAKER_15]: Those males are really going to have to be
grossed out during the seed production
[SPEAKER_15]: time, during the crop production time,
so you're not having that source of male
[SPEAKER_15]: pollen present there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_15]: Larry, you want to jump in here?
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say that some of the grant
funding that we have from New York State
[SPEAKER_13]: is to facilitate certified seed
production.
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeds are a big issue because federally,
the DEA still considers it illegal to move
[SPEAKER_13]: live seed across state lines.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a strong disincentive for
companies to invest in seed production
[SPEAKER_13]: when it is federally illegal for them to
sell across state lines.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the ANAVA Spending Act concluded
language that said that the federal
[SPEAKER_13]: government could not expend any funds to
intercept that movement, but the DEA still
[SPEAKER_13]: considers it illegal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when companies are doing their due
diligence, their lawyers tell them that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it has been a challenge for us to work
with seed companies to overcome that
[SPEAKER_13]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me also say that New York State is not
necessarily the best environment for
[SPEAKER_13]: production of disease-free seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when those restrictions are lifted,
we may well see an intensification of seed
[SPEAKER_13]: production in those states that have
optimum climate for producing disease-free
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds, mainly in Oregon, Washington,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another disincentive for New
York seed companies to produce seed here.
[SPEAKER_13]: All that being said, we had a company
committed to producing certified seed here
[SPEAKER_13]: at New York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was International Hemp Solutions.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was committed to produce certified seed
at the Oliver Chesky, one of our best
[SPEAKER_13]: health and marketing last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, it took us maybe more than
eight weeks to get that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Took us two and a half months to get the
seed imported from Poland.
[SPEAKER_13]: The first lot was contaminated and did not
get by the senators because the second lot
[SPEAKER_13]: was coming right from the breeding
institute in Poland.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that seed is now sitting in our freezer
here and is ready for next year.
[SPEAKER_13]: So next year we should have production of
certified the Oliver Chesky here at New
[SPEAKER_13]: York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question is, are there companies
that are producing seed in New York State?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, there are no companies right now
producing seed within New York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: New York State Ag and Markets has adopted
the AOSCA Seed Certification Standards,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's the American Organization of Seed
Certifying Agencies.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we now have a framework for certified
seed and putting a label on that seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: By next year we will have certified seed
production in New York State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a requirement to use certified
seed?
[SPEAKER_13]: There is not a requirement to use
certified seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: One more quick question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys working at all with the
medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_13]: So at Cornell University we do not work on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: So no, we are not working with the medical
marijuana companies.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to pass it off to Tim Sweeney.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can answer some of your questions and
give an overview of the current status of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pilot program in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tim Sweeney.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a policy analyst at Ag and Markets and
I have the privilege of overseeing a bunch
[SPEAKER_16]: of these at the hemp program.
[SPEAKER_16]: How many, just out of curiosity,
how many here are not currently involved
[SPEAKER_16]: in the program but are hoping to apply?
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think I need to run through the
entire process.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you all want to come up and talk to me
afterward I can give you the broader view.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll just do a quick synopsis right
now.
[SPEAKER_16]: As we mentioned previously, we have about
3,200 acres that could be planted in New
[SPEAKER_16]: York State approved for planting.
[SPEAKER_16]: If everyone is approved, plant it to the
extent that they apply for.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have about 3,200 acres.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have 136, I believe, growers,
research partners registered with us,
[SPEAKER_16]: authorized by us, and 28 process.
[SPEAKER_16]: We continue to take applications on a
rolling basis for people that are
[SPEAKER_16]: interested in growing for food.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not, however, able to take any
applications with regard to CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because this is a research project,
we have a lot of CBD applications come in
[SPEAKER_16]: in the past, in the first few years,
this year particularly.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have stopped taking CBD applications
to allow us to get a handle on the CBD
[SPEAKER_16]: world and to better sell it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have just established guidelines for
regulating CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are, as I said, we are still taking
applications for growers.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, given the lateness of the season,
it would probably be advisable if you
[SPEAKER_16]: wanted to apply for a permit to wait until
later in the year and apply because it is
[SPEAKER_16]: a three year permit so you wouldn't want
to waste the first year of it and not be
[SPEAKER_16]: able to get anything in the ground this
year.
[SPEAKER_16]: With regard to getting seed, as many of
you might know, if you want to get seed
[SPEAKER_16]: from an international source, you have to
come through us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We hold the DEA import permit.
[SPEAKER_16]: You would submit your request through us.
[SPEAKER_16]: You make all your arrangements with your
seed company.
[SPEAKER_16]: You submit a request to us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We then file the DEA paperwork.
[SPEAKER_16]: They send us the import permits.
[SPEAKER_16]: We then give them to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: You give them to the seed company.
[SPEAKER_16]: And your seed has to come to Albany.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to take possession of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to come to Albany.
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to pick it up in Albany.
[SPEAKER_16]: We try to get around this.
[SPEAKER_16]: We ask the DEA to allow us to meet
shipments at farms.
[SPEAKER_16]: That just is the way it is for now.
[SPEAKER_16]: As also was mentioned earlier,
there is pending federal legislation,
[SPEAKER_16]: federal farm bill.
[SPEAKER_16]: If the farm bill passes, and this is a big
if, with the language that is included in
[SPEAKER_16]: the Senate version, this program is likely
to change quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: In that, we may not be required to make
you submit a research question to us.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would take it out of the realm of
research.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would treat it more like a regular
agricultural crop.
[SPEAKER_16]: However, you would still have to come
through us.
[SPEAKER_16]: We will still be regulated.
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, if the law passes as written,
we will have to submit our program to the
[SPEAKER_16]: federal government for their approval,
and then we would be running it under the
[SPEAKER_16]: guidelines that are approved by the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are still some changes to be made
in the future, we think, with regard to
[SPEAKER_16]: how the program is run.
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps it will require less on your part
with regard to coming up with a research
[SPEAKER_16]: program, but it will still be regulated.
[SPEAKER_16]: We will still likely have to come out on
tests to ensure that the THC levels are
[SPEAKER_16]: within the definition of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_16]: So having said all that, I know usually
whenever I'm at one of these events,
[SPEAKER_16]: there's lots of questions that can take up
lots of time, so I don't want to bore you
[SPEAKER_16]: with more stuff about the process,
and I can just take questions now,
Billy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, the question is, is there a fixed
rate for CBD licenses right now?
[SPEAKER_16]: There is not a fixed rate.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've just not been able to take,
the decision was made that we're not going
[SPEAKER_16]: to take any more for the time being.
[SPEAKER_16]: We expect that sometime in the future that
we will begin taking CBD applications
[SPEAKER_16]: again, however, we're not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it would be years,
but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_16]: I do not know the rules, but this is in
part, the question was, do I know the
[SPEAKER_16]: regulations with regard to shipping CBD
over state lines in tincture form or other
[SPEAKER_16]: products like that?
[SPEAKER_16]: This is where some of the issue lies with
regard to CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: We always advise people that they need to
get a good lawyer, a lawyer that works
[SPEAKER_16]: with cannabis issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: This environment is changing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_16]: The FDA recently approved a drug called
Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures in
[SPEAKER_16]: epileptic children, and CBD is a major
component of that, which now means that
[SPEAKER_16]: CBD perhaps will be looked at differently
by the federal government.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to see what the federal
government is going to do with regard to
[SPEAKER_16]: regulation of CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: The processing grant program is run
through Empire State Development.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a different agency.
[SPEAKER_16]: I do know that they did stop taking the
applications for the time being.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure when or if that will open up,
but I think once again, it was because
[SPEAKER_16]: many of those applications were related to
CBD, and we need to get a better handle on
[SPEAKER_16]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't yet got a, it would be out of
3200 or so, and we're not yet sure how
[SPEAKER_16]: many were planted.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're in the process of having our
horticulture inspectors go out to
[SPEAKER_16]: ground-truth what actually was planted,
and then of course they'll be back out at
[SPEAKER_16]: harvest time to take the samples that need
to be tested at our lab.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_16]: The vast majority is field.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question was, how do they sell CBD
flowers in a storage unit?
[SPEAKER_16]: That is not within our program.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not within our purview,
and that is a function of a lack of
[SPEAKER_16]: clarity with regard to the laws covering
CBD and other properties.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question was, can I talk more about
how the state program will change if the
[SPEAKER_16]: farm bill passes?
[SPEAKER_16]: It will require that we will submit our
program to the federal government for
[SPEAKER_16]: their approval.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would also, it would take CBD,
sorry, it would take industrial hemp out
[SPEAKER_16]: of the world of controlled substance,
which would make it less highly regulated
[SPEAKER_16]: on the federal side, but it would still
require us to do sampling and testing to
[SPEAKER_16]: ensure that the THC levels were within the
definition, and it would no longer,
[SPEAKER_16]: if it stays as it is, I believe,
there would no longer be a requirement
[SPEAKER_16]: that it be a research project,
and the restrictions with regard to
[SPEAKER_16]: commercialization would no longer be
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now, true commercialization of the
product according to federal law is not
[SPEAKER_16]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I understand.
[SPEAKER_16]: We still have to have a handle on it
because we would still have to know where
[SPEAKER_16]: everything is growing, and we need to
sample and test it, so yes.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, are the research license
renewable?
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, the research authorization,
it's good for three years, it's a $500
[SPEAKER_16]: permit fee, and then if your research
project is not completed at the end of the
[SPEAKER_16]: three years, you can apply to us for an
extension.
[SPEAKER_16]: We haven't yet had that happen because we
haven't had this.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, would the $500 fee remain
the same if the farm bill passes?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, if the farm bill does not
pass, would we cease what we're doing now
in the state?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we are pretty well on the
road to being an industrial hip state,
[SPEAKER_16]: and I believe that we would continue to
work under the current product.
That's a tough question.
That would be my best guess.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's assume there would be a continuation
of the existing farm bill.
[SPEAKER_13]: If marijuana is legalized in the state,
how would that affect?
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, if marijuana is legalized
in the state, how would that affect?
[SPEAKER_16]: The programs would be two very distinct
and discreet operations.
[SPEAKER_16]: There has been a work group formed by the
governor's office to address the
[SPEAKER_16]: development of an adult-use marijuana
program.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not sure where there might be
overlap.
[SPEAKER_16]: There may be some in the CBD world.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that work group is meeting today
for the first time, actually.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're very much in the formative
stages.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, are we still checking THC
level if the crop is being grown for
[SPEAKER_16]: $500,000?
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we are, because the potential is
there that it could go up, and you would
[SPEAKER_16]: end up having more.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be grown next year for the 2020
growing season.
Let's say that happens when the state
stands close.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, if seed was purchased in
New York State, would it still have to be
[SPEAKER_16]: picked up at our office in Albany?
[SPEAKER_16]: The only time that anyone needs to come to
get their seed in Albany is if it's seed
[SPEAKER_16]: that's been imported from another country,
pursuant to our DEA import permit.
[SPEAKER_16]: There is some gray area with regard to
federal law and various local enforcement
[SPEAKER_16]: authorities that you may meet along the
way on your trip from Colorado to Long
[SPEAKER_16]: Island.
[SPEAKER_16]: There is some risk.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when I mentioned that it is illegal to
move across state lines, but that federal
[SPEAKER_13]: agencies could not expend money to
intercept that, that does not preclude
[SPEAKER_13]: local law enforcement agencies from
spending money to intercept.
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been ignoring this side.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, if you're growing for CBD
and you've done your extraction process,
[SPEAKER_16]: well, you've grown your CBD crop,
it's sampled by our inspectors and tested
[SPEAKER_16]: by our lab, and it's within the 0.3%,
but then through the extraction process,
[SPEAKER_16]: you come out with a product that is above
the 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that then something that needs to be
destroyed or can it be diluted?
[SPEAKER_16]: That is an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is something that we are still
trying to get a handle on, and it is part
[SPEAKER_16]: of the reason why we are no longer at this
point taking the CBD application.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because if it's above 0.3 THC,
you're not within the parameters of the
[SPEAKER_16]: industrial hemp program.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Vermont may be at 1%, but they might
have gone rogue a little bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: We are held to the standard established by
the federal law and the state law.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are other states that are taking
a different approach, but we're here and
[SPEAKER_16]: we have to do what we're told.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, do I know how many acres
out of the 3,200 are dedicated to CBD?
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know the number of acres,
but I know that out of the first 100
[SPEAKER_16]: applications we got this growing season,
50 of them were CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it was 50% at that time.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have been taking moving fiber
applications continuously, but it's a high
[SPEAKER_16]: percentage that are dedicated to CBD.
[SPEAKER_16]: The question is, is there a taxation
element to the growing or the producing of
[SPEAKER_16]: the CBD products or any of the industrial
hemp?
[SPEAKER_16]: And no, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_16]: We do not have anything like that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And our agencies, we're strictly the ag
side of things, but there are no special
[SPEAKER_16]: tax programs associated with the program.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question is, from a grower
perspective, can you optimize production
[SPEAKER_13]: of CBD while maintaining legal limits on
THC?
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_13]: Stress can induce that pathway.
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have a lot of experience here at
Cornell in studying that, but we do have
[SPEAKER_13]: two trials now underway to start to
quantify CBD and THC production across a
[SPEAKER_13]: range of different cultural artists.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris Smart will be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also developmental stage is
critical.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cross-stress can induce THC.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of these things are critical
questions to address.
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of these require quick turnaround
testing labs, which we also do not have in
[SPEAKER_13]: New York State right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is a regulatory testing that will
be done in the food lab at Ag and Markets,
[SPEAKER_13]: but many of you growers want quick
turnaround tests for THC in the middle of
[SPEAKER_13]: the season so you can judge when you
should harvest so that you don't go pop.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is, again, an urgent need for
more reliable testing labs in the state.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have one more question for Tim,
and then we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that question is, are you accepting
applications for affiliated growers for
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD production from existing license
holders?
[SPEAKER_13]: So existing CBD license holders cannot
expand.
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick question.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank Tim again.
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been an incredible partnership
and collaboration with Ag and Markets and
[SPEAKER_13]: the legislature.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ag and Markets has never turned down a
request that I know of to come and speak
[SPEAKER_13]: to a public group like this.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have been very open in working with
us, wanting to develop a program based on
[SPEAKER_13]: the science, which I highly respect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, we're grateful for their
research funding.
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks, Tim.
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of those questions that folks
were asking are very challenging in our
[SPEAKER_13]: current legal landscape.
[SPEAKER_13]: I serve on the industrial hemp working
group, named by the commissioner of
[SPEAKER_13]: agriculture, Mike Barnhart, who's here,
also serves on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not sure there are other folks here on the
working group.
[SPEAKER_13]: But when the governor accepted the report
from the commissioner on health for
[SPEAKER_13]: proposing adult use marijuana here,
and the decriminalization of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_13]: that poses particular challenges for the
industrial hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're growing for CBD in
particular, if your plants go hot,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're considered marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: So perhaps you will be better off,
if you're a CBD producer, getting a
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana grow request.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we don't know what that program will
look like, whether we will have outdoor
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana production, and how that will
interact with our existing medical
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are very challenging questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, the state has been very prudent
in rolling out these programs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that they're doing it again
by putting the brakes on the CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: production right now until we can work out
the gold standard for regulation.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to move on.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie Crawford from Don Bynes program is
going to talk about our cultivar trials.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this year we had 32 entries in our
trials, while last year we had 17.
[SPEAKER_11]: So at almost a double, that's pretty
exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully it doesn't double again,
because we couldn't really handle that
[SPEAKER_11]: many entries.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if any of you folks are growing
varieties that you don't see on this list,
[SPEAKER_11]: please let us know, because I would be
really interested to know if there are
[SPEAKER_11]: green or fiber varieties in New York this
year that we haven't been testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: So from these lists you can see we got
varieties from Canada, from Serbia,
[SPEAKER_11]: from Ukraine, from Italy, from Poland,
also some from Oregon, things developed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some entries are pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: When the market started to expand,
there was sort of a variety grab of
[SPEAKER_11]: European varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: So United States companies have been
buying up exclusive rights to a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: European types.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one thing that we do have in our trials
is taiga.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a seed lot of taiga that we
purchased last year that we saved the seed
[SPEAKER_11]: from, and that was produced in Poland.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have taiga that was produced
in Kentucky last growing season.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have those two next to
each other.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will be really interesting to see
what the differences are, if any,
[SPEAKER_11]: just because of where the seed was grown.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we divided all of our entries up into
three trials this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a fiber trial, that's pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then we have a grain cultivar trial,
and then what we're calling dual purpose.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those were divided by time to
maturity.
[SPEAKER_11]: So based on the information given to us
from the seed companies, anything that was
[SPEAKER_11]: 110 days to maturity or less went into the
grain trial.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then more than 110 days went into the
dual purpose trial.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sad that you guys aren't able to
see the variety trials, because I think
[SPEAKER_11]: that really highlights the importance of
regional testing for the varieties,
[SPEAKER_11]: because we have two varieties in our grain
trial that are not flowering yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything else is about knee height and
starting to set seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those two varieties are still not
flowering.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then in our dual purpose trial,
we have three or four varieties that are
[SPEAKER_11]: also starting to set seed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was all just based on information
given to us from the seed companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that just highlights how important the
regional testing is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this year, we've got six different
locations for our trials.
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the front, you guys can see the map.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're growing some of the trial on Juana
Island this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have some good information for
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have two locations here in Geneva,
one in Ipika, and then one on our organic
[SPEAKER_11]: free-build farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for all the organic growers,
we hope to be able to provide some good
[SPEAKER_11]: information about that this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the last trial is in Chezy.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just about as far north as you can get
and still be in New York State.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'll be some good information,
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: People that we've worked with in Canada
have told us that varieties that are eight
[SPEAKER_11]: feet tall in Canada are only three feet
tall here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we'll get a little bit more
height in our Chezy trial than we do here
[SPEAKER_11]: or in locations.
[SPEAKER_11]: So our first trial we planted last year
was in, we planted it June 9th.
[SPEAKER_11]: June 9th was our first trial last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an exceptional planting.
[SPEAKER_11]: This year, everything that we planted was
within two weeks of that date.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the establishment wasn't, it was,
I mean, you guys know, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It was dry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a dry June and a dry early July
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we went and we took notes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just comparing this year's data to
last year's, we had, it's two feet.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Ipika, our trial is planted in the
field directly next door to the one we
[SPEAKER_11]: planted last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So everything should be the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was planted four days later.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you would think that would have that
much of an impact.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the height on average, the trial is
two feet shorter this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: Than last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's because we've had half the rain
that we've had last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the first month, so the first four
weeks after planting, we had less than two
[SPEAKER_11]: inches in Ipika.
[SPEAKER_11]: And last year we had closer to five
inches.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a really big difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I brought a plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a plant from our fiber trial
last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was actually taller.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see the top of it broke off.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to get fiber yields like
that this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just not going to happen because
everything is so much shorter.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have confidence that our grain yields
could still be very good.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plots filled in nicely.
[SPEAKER_11]: But our fiber, because of the drought,
is going to be, right now the plants are
[SPEAKER_11]: about as tall as me.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't think, and they're starting to
flower.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're not going to get to be like
this this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So one more thing I wanted to mention is
the seed cost.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're testing 32 varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of them cost just under $3 a
pound when you include shipping fees.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of them are over $30 a pound when
you include shipping fees.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we're just buying enough for our
trials, that may not be a big deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm sure when you folks are planting
many, many acres of it, that would add up
[SPEAKER_11]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know there's people doing economic
analysis of that as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we hope to provide that to you all as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see maybe you get a little bit
of a yield bump with something that you're
[SPEAKER_11]: paying $32 a pound for.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're not getting the yield,
if it doesn't make up that initial seed
[SPEAKER_11]: cost, that would be very important to
know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Harvest is coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't have any information about
that for this year.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are recording the maturity at
different times throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should be able to report on
flowering times for each of the different
[SPEAKER_11]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I was saying is that what we were
noticing is differences in our trials than
[SPEAKER_11]: what was in the company information.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't have that from one year to the
next.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll have that for this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the flowering time, because we're
covering almost 2 degrees latitude,
[SPEAKER_13]: the flowering time is taking different in
Long Island than it is in Chesapeake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, with the fiber, how much growth
does all that have to start to flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't stop.
[SPEAKER_11]: So from that point on, it's just the
flowering head that grows.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the part that would snap off easily and
would not be really useful for the fiber
[SPEAKER_11]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we harvested pretty quickly after
that.
Other questions?
[SPEAKER_11]: His question was, have we done any ready
trials?
[SPEAKER_11]: We attempted to rep some of our material
in Ithaca last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a learning process, I'll say.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did take stems out of each plot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we made little humidity things in the
greenhouse just out of plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we kept spraying to get it to spread
that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we do have some of that information
just on a few stems from each plot.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the field readiness, I think it's an
art.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to take some practice.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this year for our fiber trials,
we're working with Dr. Jared Nelson at
[SPEAKER_13]: SUNY New Paltz together with Jen Gilbert
Jenkins at Morrisville State College.
[SPEAKER_13]: So together, the three of us have defined
ready protocols that we're going to use
[SPEAKER_13]: for our fiber trials.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will field rep all of our fiber this
year, determine a weight of straw,
[SPEAKER_13]: which we didn't do last year for each
plot, and then share some of that material
[SPEAKER_13]: with Jared to do mechanical analysis on
the fiber.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'd be happy to share material with
other folks to analyze the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, we gave all of our border rows
to a gentleman who actually has his own
[SPEAKER_11]: pits.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so he water-redded it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he sent us some of the information
that he received.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it was his first time trying
it too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: He asked if we had published our grain
yield from last year.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not in a peer-reviewed publication
yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of those agronomy journals require
two years of data to publish it in a
[SPEAKER_13]: peer-reviewed journal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe we're waiting to get this
year's data.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have tables, certainly of our
graphs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see the ranges of yields in the
different locations based on different
[SPEAKER_11]: planting times.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's not, we'll get it on.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll make sure it's there.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or I'd be happy to email it to you
directly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, there was huge variation
depending on location.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some locations were just around 600 pounds
per acre.
[SPEAKER_11]: For the yield, so pretty low.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were things that had poor
establishment and then a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_11]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_13]: For this year or for last year?
[SPEAKER_13]: For both years.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's quite a range across different sites.
[SPEAKER_13]: And drainage classes as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the drainage classes and the soil
types were definitely on the handout from
[SPEAKER_11]: last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so those are on the website.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 17 plantings and we can certainly
add those to this year's for you guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie is the one who acquires all of our
seed for us.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: Our plantings went in probably 10 days
later than we would have liked.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, because we're waiting.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're waiting for five or six seed to come
to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that has been a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: My number one piece of advice for all of
you here is order your seed early.
[SPEAKER_13]: Try to get it in by February.
[SPEAKER_13]: Even from Canada.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keenan Stone is here from Uniseed.
[SPEAKER_13]: The delays in getting seed from Canada
into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: seem to be even worse this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: So order your seed early.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Matt Chartrand from Elson Shield's
group is going to talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling he's been done doing for insect
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name's Matt.
[SPEAKER_10]: As Larry said, I've been working with Dr.
Elson Shields this summer.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not here actually today.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been working to survey the insect
pests that are out in the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_10]: fields.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the best way to show you guys
is this brochure here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you don't have one, there's a couple
more up on the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically this whole summer what I've
been doing is going out to various farms.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been to 10 different counties so far
this season to sweep for insects and kind
[SPEAKER_10]: of get an idea of what's actually out
there in the fields and what may become an
[SPEAKER_10]: issue for growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the center three panels here,
you'll see there's three different insect
[SPEAKER_10]: pests that I highlighted.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first on the left is the French plant
bug.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is by far the highest population
pest.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's a little bit of information
that won't take too long for you with the
[SPEAKER_10]: feeding styles.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you want to learn more about the
French plant bug, there's a little bit on
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the center panel here we have
the European corn borer.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only seen this in one trial actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was down in Orange County.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the most devastating insect
I've seen so far.
[SPEAKER_10]: It only went after two plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it took, it went, it bored into the
stem of the plant, resulting in death of
[SPEAKER_10]: the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that grower had to take out those
two CBD products.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you can see, and as Gary was talking
about earlier, the disease and insects are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be like a working document
basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if the farmer sees something,
take a picture or collect it and feel free
[SPEAKER_10]: to send it along to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: My email is on this brochure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or just collect it and send that actual
physical sample to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how we heard about the European
corn borer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also we got the flea beetles,
which seem to be in pretty high
[SPEAKER_10]: population, as well as the far right panel
in the center.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the flea beetles basically are
vegetative feeders.
[SPEAKER_10]: They go after the leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: They give those pinhole kind of feeding
sides that are in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so not necessarily something that's
going to be harming your yield in the long
[SPEAKER_10]: run, but something to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on the center fold in here,
we have the Japanese beetle.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're a grower around here,
which many of you are out here,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know we have a lot of Japanese beetles
in this area.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the good news is I haven't seen
them growing out here too many head
[SPEAKER_10]: plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that one example below is an example
of what they can do.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it may be something to keep in mind for
the future years of growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you see a high Japanese beetle
population, it may be something to keep in
[SPEAKER_10]: mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then one last thing I just wanted to
mention.
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole project has been based on
insect pests.
[SPEAKER_10]: So insects that are actually harming the
plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been seeing a lot of natural
predators as well, which is a good sign.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're seeing these high levels of
pests out in the field, and it also
[SPEAKER_10]: contributes to the high number of
predators, that means that there actually
[SPEAKER_10]: may be a good sense of biocontrol in these
high beetles.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as we all know, there's nothing listed
for spraying as of right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be a continuing process
of learning what's out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're at the mercy of your help.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you see something, please feel free
to email it to us or let us know.
What proactive steps have you seen that
have been helpful in containing or keeping
pests in that bag?
Have you seen things that have just
methods that have been helpful?
[SPEAKER_10]: Proactive is just sort of a cost share
rather than a product or other reactive
element.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question is, what steps have been
taken to assure that you're trying to help
[SPEAKER_10]: reduce these pests levels?
[SPEAKER_10]: And just overall good agricultural
practices.
[SPEAKER_10]: Controlling weeds, keeping weeds low
because a lot of that's going to attract
[SPEAKER_10]: other pests that are going to be attracted
to your area.
[SPEAKER_10]: Natural rotation is a big one.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're growing in the same field
over and over again, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_10]: to switch it out because then you're going
to have the same populations of pests
[SPEAKER_10]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: From the Portland County area,
there's a lot of slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is that different from any of the
larger growers?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so the slugs and snails are a little
interesting in themselves because it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: technically in the insect category.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have been seeing in this audio one
at UCM, one thing that I have seen from
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the farmer's stuff and up to is
diatomaceous berry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a material that you can use
basically as a berry.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the slugs and the snails go over it,
it tears them up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's not necessarily a
chemical-based control, but that is
[SPEAKER_10]: something that you can use culturally.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, did you say disease?
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, so that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these don't have a lot of natural
predators, the ones that I've specifically
[SPEAKER_10]: highlighted here.
[SPEAKER_10]: The more of the things which makes sense
why I'm not seeing them in high
[SPEAKER_10]: populations because of the natural
predators would be things like thrips and
[SPEAKER_10]: aphids, more of the soft-bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of how these predators work is
they'll inject their eggs into the soft
[SPEAKER_10]: bodies and that will kill them.
[SPEAKER_10]: The inside is kind of like a parasite,
parasitoid, and then also just feeding on
[SPEAKER_10]: the insects themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Japanese beetle, as many of you
know, is pretty hardy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a hard exoskeleton, so it doesn't
have many natural predators.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so with these kind of things,
I think the long-term goal is to figure
[SPEAKER_10]: out ways to control it, whether in terms
of pesticides or other bio-controls that
[SPEAKER_10]: we can bring in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen any more or less issues with
greenhouse production?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the greenhouse production is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only seen two different trials that
I've been to for greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of flies, actually, the majority
of flies are just attracted to the plant
[SPEAKER_10]: itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not necessarily causing damage as
they're feeding on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_10]: but they're inducing, in a sense,
of trying to work in the grass with lots
[SPEAKER_10]: of flies in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the fungus nets?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so the fungus nets are actually,
I haven't seen them in high populations
[SPEAKER_10]: just because, I mean, the one greenhouse I
was in was a seed house or a transplant
[SPEAKER_10]: house, basically, so they're partying them
off, transplant outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fungus nets is something to keep
in mind, especially with consistent water,
[SPEAKER_10]: the skill of the fungus nets.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen any spider mites in the
field recently?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually have only seen one case of
spider mites, which is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as you all know, we're kind of getting
into the season where everything's
[SPEAKER_10]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from the work done in Colorado and
from the West, they see a high percentage
[SPEAKER_10]: of the spider mites coming after
flowering, especially in the female
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's something to keep in mind as the
research continues.
Thanks, Matt.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Matt is an intern funded by Cornell
Aquatic Extension and Cornell
[SPEAKER_13]: Undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to take this opportunity,
because of Matt's ties with CCE,
[SPEAKER_13]: to mention that we have a number of our
CCE camp team specialists here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe they could stand up.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mike Hunter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Katie O'Neill.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mike Stanier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mary Ulrich.
[SPEAKER_13]: Janice Degney.
[SPEAKER_13]: And John Hancher.
[SPEAKER_13]: John Hancher.
[SPEAKER_13]: We made copies of John Hancher.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and Jody Lader.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's been tremendous working with all
these folks.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you have problems, they can be
your first line of defense.
[SPEAKER_13]: So by all means, get their cards and get
their regional locations so they can help
[SPEAKER_00]: you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to talk about an experiment
that we're taking on to try to address,
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, one of the important issues that
faces hemp cultivation, especially as we
[SPEAKER_13]: move towards an adult use marijuana
program, if it's going to be outdoors
[SPEAKER_13]: here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Dave Williams at the University of
Kentucky, who is one of our primary
[SPEAKER_13]: academic researchers in hemp in the
country, shared with me this unpublished
[SPEAKER_13]: data that highlights the key issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is, if you are growing for CBD
production, there is a two to three-fold
[SPEAKER_13]: decrease in CBD concentration in the
flower shoots when the female flowers
[SPEAKER_13]: become pollinated.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is your profit rendering away when
your female plants are pollinated.
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems to be even worse on some of the
lower ground than the top flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question is, is it the same with THC?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Essentially, the entire pathway and I'm
not sure whether it's because of a
[SPEAKER_13]: decrease in the production of the
trichomes on those fishes or
[SPEAKER_13]: downregulation of the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the bottom line is, you want to
maintain, in a horticultural growth
[SPEAKER_13]: setting, you want to maintain your female
plants un-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a key question, I think,
that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a key question for my breeding
program, is whether we continue on in this
[SPEAKER_13]: horticultural setting in wide spacing from
transplants, female plants, planted with
[SPEAKER_13]: feminized seeds, which is incredibly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I have one grower tell me this is a
$20,000 per acre investment in seeds and
[SPEAKER_13]: labor.
[SPEAKER_13]: Zach is shaking his head.
[SPEAKER_13]: So harvesting those plants by hand and
growing them will add up to the cost,
[SPEAKER_13]: add up into the cost.
[SPEAKER_13]: The alternative is a more agricultural
system, in tight spacing, allowing those
[SPEAKER_13]: plants to get pollinated, perhaps
capturing a grain yield in addition to a
[SPEAKER_13]: CBD yield, mechanically harvested,
mechanically dried.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the alternative.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we can breed for cultivars
that produce even higher CBD.
[SPEAKER_13]: So last year, future of 75, one of our
full purpose grain and fiber cultivars,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll call it a triple purpose,
because it produced 2% CBD while also
[SPEAKER_13]: producing a reasonable grain.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's an issue that
fundamental cultivation issue that growers
[SPEAKER_13]: will address.
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope to breed cultivars that can make
their choice a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Industrial hemp is wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nate will come up and talk about some of
the bees that he's seen in field so far
[SPEAKER_13]: this year.
[SPEAKER_13]: But those bees that are attracted to the
male flowers are not attracted to the
[SPEAKER_13]: female flowers.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no after production.
[SPEAKER_13]: The wind is very, the pollen is very light
and dry.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's carried by the wind.
[SPEAKER_13]: In the Midwest, where there is a lot of
ditch weed, feral hemp is grown around in
[SPEAKER_13]: Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota,
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hemp pollen can be more than 30% of the
pollen that's trapped in late summer.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is a major issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: Fortunately, we do not have very much
feral hemp in New York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: We've collected from one feral population
in Fort Wayne.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard about a couple of others that I
will investigate here in the next month.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have very little feral hemp.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is not a major concern in New York
State.
[SPEAKER_13]: The major concern would be if your
neighbor across the street plants a grain
[SPEAKER_13]: and fiber field of a monaceous or a
dioecious variety that's going to produce
[SPEAKER_13]: a lot of pollen and you're directly
downwind with your CBD or in the future
[SPEAKER_13]: outdoor marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question is, how far will that pollen
move?
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are anecdotal stories of pollen
flowing from Morocco to Spain.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a critical issue for certified seed
production also.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can look to the AASCA standards and
the standards in Canada for certified seed
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the AASCA standards are a three
mile isolation zone in Canada,
[SPEAKER_13]: five kilometers.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no academic research on this
topic, very little.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's one paper by Ernie Small at
University of Toronto where they took
[SPEAKER_13]: glass slides coated with grease and
trapped pollen at various instances from
[SPEAKER_13]: hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that track has been the handout.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see that over 10 meters,
there is only 20% of the pollen rate
[SPEAKER_13]: compared to next to the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: At 400 meters, there is less than 1% of
the pollen that is produced at the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: What they did not do is test whether there
is sufficient pollen to pollinate those
[SPEAKER_13]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because even less than 1% of the total
pollen produced may be enough to get full
[SPEAKER_13]: seed sets.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we have done here, this is a
challenging experiment because of the size
[SPEAKER_13]: of our farm, we planted a three acre field
of anca over here in the rain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then planted female plants of three
different cultivars, proposed to be high
[SPEAKER_13]: CDE cultivars in microplots, one of them
right next to the anca field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it should get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in the four ornament directions
at 200 meters away and at 400 to 500
[SPEAKER_13]: meters away to the northwest and south.
[SPEAKER_13]: On the east side, we could only go 200
meters to our property line.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we jumped to 1500 meters to the east to
our next available planting spot.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will monitor those plants for signs
of pollination.
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the season, we will quantify
seed yield by plant as a measure of
[SPEAKER_13]: functional pollination.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will also extract cannabinoids and
quantify CBD production by plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this will give us sort of a dual
purpose experiment.
[SPEAKER_13]: We will get a lot of site information,
genotype by environment information on CBD
[SPEAKER_13]: production, because we've got nine
different sites here.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will also be able to verify Dave
Williams' data about the two to three fold
[SPEAKER_13]: drop of CBD production upon pollination.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's our first attempt.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know, the conditions here in
New York State with our topography,
[SPEAKER_13]: with our moist climate, let's speak,
compared to Oregon and Colorado,
[SPEAKER_13]: where they talk about 10 mile pollen
movement.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think our distances will be much shorter
than the potential distances in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_13]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we need replicated data to know.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll stop there and I think we have to
take any questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question is, the question is,
who is going to manage the geographic
[SPEAKER_13]: arrangement of fiber plantings,
grain and fiber plantings, versus CBD and
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially marijuana?
[SPEAKER_13]: The state ag and market has already said
that they will not regulate that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are not interested in imposing
regulated pollen exclusion zones to the
[SPEAKER_13]: preference of CBD producers over our grain
and fiber producers.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I would suggest is that meetings like
this, you get to know your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in my opinion, the best way to
regulate that is neighbor to neighbor.
[SPEAKER_13]: But sometimes that's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you may need to work it out through
other means.
[SPEAKER_13]: That may be talking about rotating fields,
varying distances, compensating someone
[SPEAKER_13]: not to plant in one field in preference
for another field.
[SPEAKER_13]: The ultimate assurance is to move your
plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question is, how much risk are you
for pollination in a hoop house,
[SPEAKER_13]: for example?
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is absolutely no data on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have to have a very small mesh.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you aware of that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a guy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, in terms of hoop house
production, we're really screened to keep
[SPEAKER_09]: out pollen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a bit about this that people are
looking for screens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And depending on the pathogen,
the pollen and the pathogen may be of
[SPEAKER_09]: similar sizes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know one vegetable grower who wants
to keep all pathogen spores out of his
[SPEAKER_09]: high tunnel hoop house.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he actually put HEPA filters on the
ends of the high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has been extremely effective.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he grows tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And tomatoes are really happy at 120
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're trying to grow HEP for CEBD
at 120 degrees Fahrenheit, chances are
[SPEAKER_09]: your THC levels are going to go through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that HEPA filters are the only
filter that's going to be effective in
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping pollen out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other questions?
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_13]: so I think the question is about its
isolation distances for certified seed
[SPEAKER_13]: production.
[SPEAKER_13]: So can you talk about how Canada regulates
isolation zones?
[SPEAKER_06]: So for certified seed production in Canada
for industrial hemp, we actually have
[SPEAKER_06]: three levels of isolation distances.
[SPEAKER_06]: The closest for just certified seed
production is one kilometer of the same
[SPEAKER_06]: variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a moderation cultivar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be five kilometers if there's
isolation between a moderation cultivar
[SPEAKER_06]: and a variation cultivar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be five kilometers isolation if
it's different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's the same cultivar but of a higher
pedigree, it could be, I think it's three
[SPEAKER_06]: kilometers isolation between those
different pedigrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you start from breeder seed,
you have breeder, foundation, registered,
[SPEAKER_06]: certified.
[SPEAKER_13]: Other questions?
So the
[SPEAKER_13]: question is, will we measure THC before
pollination and after pollination?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have not collected any samples yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is active pollen production in
our field.
[SPEAKER_13]: So our intention is, our hope is that some
of these microplots will not be pollinated
[SPEAKER_13]: by the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_13]: And those will be our measure of
non-pollinated plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the question is, could you recover from
a field that's gone off by pollinating it?
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know where you would, at the end
of the season, where you would all of a
[SPEAKER_13]: sudden get all this pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a good idea on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you had plants elsewhere that weren't
actively making pollen.
[SPEAKER_13]: One more question about pollination.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you, there's no data from it,
from Colorado, Oregon, California,
where?
[SPEAKER_13]: There are no publishing.
Not on papers, but just like talk to
growers about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, again, you talk to growers and
they'll say, you've got to be 10 miles
[SPEAKER_13]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not, I've only been doing this a
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not encountered anyone who has told
me, yeah, my field got pollinated and
[SPEAKER_13]: ruined.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just haven't, I haven't encountered
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of typos.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I have encountered is folks from
Europe who have said, I have my field
[SPEAKER_13]: here, my neighbor has his field over
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_13]: We are never crossed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my pleasure to introduce Dr. Heather
Gratt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Larry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anybody hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So given that Larry has told you all that
he does not need pollinators and in fact,
[SPEAKER_07]: probably suffer from pollen pollinators,
you might be wondering why I'm not here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because without pollinators, probably,
actually by show of hands, I would love to
[SPEAKER_07]: see how many of you have heard about
pollinator concerns, saving the bees,
[SPEAKER_07]: all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we're working on in our
African Colony lab down in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: We work on all kinds of beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've heard quite a bit about all of
the bees that are showing up in these
[SPEAKER_07]: industrial fields and trials.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided to come out and take a look
and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not because we think that having bees in
the field is a benefit to farmers per se,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we think it could actually get huge
benefits to the bees that are out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of research has been going on,
figuring out why we're treating so many
[SPEAKER_07]: kinds of bees, has identified lack of
pollen, lack of soil resources as a major
[SPEAKER_07]: key that are out there every day
pollinating your crops, but they're also
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for other things to eat when
strawberries aren't blooming, apples
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't blooming, squash isn't blooming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know that during the window,
when hemp is starting to flower,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's a period of time in New York State
where we have very few floral resources on
[SPEAKER_07]: the rampage.
[SPEAKER_07]: So potentially, as we grow this industry,
we're starting to add a huge resource for
[SPEAKER_07]: our wild bees back into the landscape.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Fred and I are doing this summer,
as things are starting to bloom,
[SPEAKER_07]: is to go out and survey in fields and
figure out which bees are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it may not be that your cells are
benefiting very much from having those
[SPEAKER_07]: bees there, but if you grow other crops,
if your neighbors are growing colony or
[SPEAKER_07]: turning crops, if you have an apple
orchard that's blooming in the spring,
[SPEAKER_07]: strawberries, raspberries, squash,
peeled tomatoes, any of these other crops,
[SPEAKER_07]: the same bees that we're seeing right now
in the hemp field are the bees that are
[SPEAKER_07]: the most affected.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by supporting them in a period of time
when there maybe isn't very many other
[SPEAKER_07]: coals floating around, we could actually
be contributing to supporting their
[SPEAKER_07]: propagation overall and have a long-term
statistical effect, not just for wild bees
[SPEAKER_07]: in general, but also for crop production
outside of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna hand it over to Nate,
and he's gonna tell you a little bit about
[SPEAKER_07]: the details of the project and the survey
that we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the main kind of motivation
behind the project is with this new huge
[SPEAKER_02]: surge of hemp in the U.S.
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it essentially going to be
affecting the bee communities we have here
[SPEAKER_02]: right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much you've seen so far that
hemp, or bees really do love hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Larry was saying, hemp has completely
been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp doesn't have extra floral nectaries,
so bees can't collect nectar from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only getting home.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen bees visiting male
flowers, so the bees are not pollinating
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have seen them go to hemp in mass,
like we've seen a lot of bees there,
[SPEAKER_02]: bumblebees, honeybees, and also a lot of
native bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've done is we have 10 farms
around Ithaca, Geneva, and Manitoba,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're gonna be visiting them three to
four times with bee master bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be collecting all the bees we
catch, bring them back to the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: and identify them as species, and then
we're gonna look at them in the crop
[SPEAKER_02]: network, like Heather was saying,
and see essentially where the bees that we
[SPEAKER_02]: see at each site overlap with other crops
in that landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also hopefully gonna be looking at
floral resources within the landscape to
[SPEAKER_02]: see essentially how much bees have in that
site, and whether that's important,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm counting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The handout has a couple photos of what it
looks like.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're really collecting huge amounts of
pollen from those male plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the list
[SPEAKER_07]: of projects progresses with your force of
crop that would be most beneficial to
[SPEAKER_07]: actually have hemp growing nearby in order
to get
to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, great question.
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is about what happens when
bees, particularly honeybees, because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're the ones that are producing all
the bees, are visiting these crops,
[SPEAKER_07]: collecting pollen, bringing it back to the
hive where it may mix in with honey,
[SPEAKER_07]: and so far we have no data on what that
means for those honey qualities.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's certainly lots of things that we
are tracking other bodies that are coming
[SPEAKER_07]: in, so we're worried a lot about
pesticides, that bees are picking up with
[SPEAKER_07]: four or five bees, given the current
regulatory depth of hemp, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_07]: worry about them bringing back pesticides,
pesticides, and other things back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: hive, but are they bringing in common bee
or PhD in pollen?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know, but they certainly don't
have to look at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's so much midweed in the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: There must be a lot.
Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have 72 hives on our property right
next to the hemp field, but we've really
[SPEAKER_12]: seen maybe two or three bees on hemp
plants.
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all avoiding it, basically.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know if any of your sites
actually have bees right next to the hemp
[SPEAKER_12]: field, or not?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're hearing about a scenario where
we have a lot of hives right next to a
[SPEAKER_07]: field of hemp.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nine acres.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine acres, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that we have been
noticing is when we're on really large
[SPEAKER_07]: fields, but even in the field of hemp
that's greater than three acres,
[SPEAKER_07]: we see many fewer bees per plant in those
kinds of scenarios.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's probably not that they're
avoiding a field so much, it's that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're going to delete it in the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we don't see them, as obviously we
would in a small trial, that's just a
[SPEAKER_07]: micro plot cranking where there's really a
ton of bees.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also probably a factor,
maybe your farm has something else that
[SPEAKER_07]: they like better nearby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Honey bees are social.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can recruit foragers into really high
quality forest areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, they might have something better right
now that they're going to, but that's not
[SPEAKER_07]: always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are in the long stretch,
gang.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if anyone does not have a handout,
Larry can give you one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like all the others, more or
less, but it says evaluation of industrial
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp cultivars for CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was really looking forward to having
folks up at our CBD trial this morning
[SPEAKER_09]: because, you know, when I started this a
couple years ago, I heard, oh,
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp can grow anywhere, hemp through
slabs, hemp, we got some plants that are
[SPEAKER_09]: downright dead.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm looking forward for you guys to
understand that, you know, there are
[SPEAKER_09]: places where hemp loves to grow and there
are places that hemp is really unhappy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, where we have one of our CBD
variety trials, if you look at the back of
[SPEAKER_09]: the sheet, you can see the list of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: The varieties that were planted were
started in the greenhouse because we
[SPEAKER_09]: wanted to ensure that we had germination
and plant establishment and actually
[SPEAKER_09]: Larry's lab did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The folks on the stairs over there,
team hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plants were then in storage pots
and planted into the fields and the dates
[SPEAKER_09]: were early July, July 6th in our intricate
trial and July 9th in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, when those were planted, we were just
at the end of the very dry period.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we had, they're on ready fed with drip
irrigation and plastic and we were
[SPEAKER_09]: irrigating now and then it started to
rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one end of the field that they're in
is just a wee bit lower than the other
[SPEAKER_09]: end.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the water drain that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the plants that had wet feet for an
extended period of time, even though they
[SPEAKER_09]: were on raised beds, some of them flat out
died.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them are extremely stunted.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you go down the field, when you get
that slight incline, the plants at the end
[SPEAKER_09]: that was just a big dryer are doing quite
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think it's really important to know
that that concept that you can plant it
[SPEAKER_09]: and it will grow is not always the case.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's an interesting trial to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason that we're doing the trial is
to answer some of the questions that many
[SPEAKER_09]: of you have asked in terms of what impacts
CBD levels and what impacts THC levels
[SPEAKER_09]: here in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're growing for CBD, you don't want
your plants to hit above that 0.3% THC
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have information from Colorado and
Oregon and Kentucky, but we don't have
[SPEAKER_09]: information on the stressors in New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, the plants that have now had
wet feet for much of their lives in the
[SPEAKER_09]: field, are they going to have a higher THC
or CBD content because of that blood
[SPEAKER_09]: stress?
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, to compare, we actually are growing
the ultra-rich CBD, the seven ultra-rich
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties from Nevada.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're growing those in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we want to do is compare the
yield as well as the CBD and the THC
[SPEAKER_09]: levels of the greenhouse grown plants to
those plants that were grown in the field.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for this year, we'll compare the
Ithaca tribes trial, the Geneva trial,
[SPEAKER_09]: and the greenhouse plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I saw some pictures that Jamie,
I think, showed that the plants in the
[SPEAKER_09]: field, you know, plant architecture is one
of the things that we're looking at in
[SPEAKER_09]: these varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in a heavy rain and wind down in the
Ithaca trial, was that last week,
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the plants actually snapped.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the stem was just not strong
enough to handle the foliage and the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: architecture that was above.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, what we're measuring on all of these
plants right now, we are measuring
[SPEAKER_09]: establishment.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if they die, we're measuring
plant architecture.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing that by counting the number of
nodes where leaves would come out of the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant and then the number of nodes that
have branches.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that gives you an idea of how branchy
the plant is.
[SPEAKER_09]: For some people, they're looking for a big
branchy plant that looks more like a
[SPEAKER_09]: Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for other folks, they want maybe a
single head.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, we want to be able to provide you
with, in New York, in our daylight,
[SPEAKER_09]: what is the plant going to look like?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really the goal of this study.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we'll have plant architecture.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have height.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the greenhouse, what are our
tallest plants now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Two meters?
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the fields, they're roughly the
same.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we have plant height as well as
architecture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what we'll have is not only CBD
levels, but we hope to have the whole
[SPEAKER_09]: panel of cannabidiol, cannabinoids
compounds, so that we can give you an idea
[SPEAKER_09]: of what is being produced under these
conditions, each of the conditions that we
[SPEAKER_09]: had our trials in.
[SPEAKER_09]: As we move forward, we hope to then be
able to compare.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next year, we hope to have some plants in
high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, our high tunnels are in a place
that gets rather wet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that will have to be modified.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be great to be able to give
you guys information on high tunnel
[SPEAKER_09]: production versus greenhouse production
versus field production.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we really hope to be able
to do with some of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as new cultivars come along,
new genetics in the plants, we hope to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to test, as Larry said, one of the
things you really want to be able to do
[SPEAKER_09]: with experiments like this is to test
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we can sort of on the fly understand
how stress conditions are modifying the
[SPEAKER_09]: secondary metabolites or CBDs in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, one of the things that my lab is doing
along those same lines is we're looking at
[SPEAKER_09]: the hemp microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you've heard of the human microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all have microbes on our skin and in
our stomach, and that affects many,
[SPEAKER_09]: many attributes of our health.
[SPEAKER_09]: The same exact thing is true in plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of my students, a PhD student,
Ali Kala, has looked last year at the
[SPEAKER_09]: microbiome of the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she has now, we think, identified sort
of the microbes that are on hemp,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and she looked at six different
locations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have sort of a core microbiome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's sort of a starting place in
terms of understanding what bacteria and
[SPEAKER_09]: fungi are on plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these aren't necessarily pests.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just present and interacting with
the plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's known from other systems that the
microbes on the plant can modify things
[SPEAKER_09]: like drought tolerance, flowering time,
and secondary metabolism, which could
[SPEAKER_09]: modify our CHC or CBD levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we really want to know what's there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Additionally, if there are beneficial
microbes that are being, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're associating with the roots of
plants, if we can identify some of those,
[SPEAKER_09]: then we can work with Al Taylor,
who is an expert at using things like that
[SPEAKER_09]: to actually enhance plant growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, those are some of the things that
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that Ali found that I thought
was absolutely fascinating was that in the
[SPEAKER_09]: microbes that are found on the flowers,
of the hemp plant, the most common
[SPEAKER_09]: microbes are those microbes that have
previously been reported from extreme
[SPEAKER_09]: environments, like hot springs and high
salt.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, there's something, you know,
the secondary metabolites in the flower of
[SPEAKER_09]: the plant that the microbes that associate
there are those that can handle extreme
[SPEAKER_09]: environments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, that's something that we'll be
looking into as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, were there other things about the
variety trial?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure, flowering time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're noting that both in the greenhouse
and in the field, and the field plants
[SPEAKER_09]: have flowered earlier than the greenhouse
plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have one plant, but it wasn't
planted after the field.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything was from seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there are some out of flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how many.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have, I think, four of them that are
part of auto-flowering.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that'll be included, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have the cultivars, or lines,
that still have not flowered.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we have both males and females in the
population, and as soon as we see a male,
[SPEAKER_09]: we cut that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are cultivars that have not
flowered yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't even know if the plants are male
or female.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the future, will you try varieties that
come from places that plants have wet
[SPEAKER_09]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_09]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the future, will we try varieties of
cultivars that can handle more rain?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can find those, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's going to be one of the
things that our breeding program that is
[SPEAKER_09]: led by Dr. Smart will look at.
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with the flowering time and
daylight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have artificial lighting in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so we do have artificial lighting in
the greenhouse, but it is not longer than
[SPEAKER_09]: the daylight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you want to add?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's one of the things that we hope
to get out of our high tunnel experiments
[SPEAKER_09]: next year, is can we manage more moisture
via high tunnel, and how does that compare
[SPEAKER_09]: to greenhouse production?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so the question is, did the dry
period at the beginning of the year cause
[SPEAKER_09]: excess stress on the plants causing them
to flower earlier compared to those in the
[SPEAKER_09]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a combination of the dry
at the beginning, followed by prolonged
[SPEAKER_09]: wetness that is added to stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk more about your harvesting
plan?
[SPEAKER_09]: Our harvesting plan, right, so how do we
decide when to harvest, and how do you
[SPEAKER_09]: decide when it's 20 days before our
harvest, so you can let Tim know?
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a lot of discussions on how are
we going to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, how are we going to do that,
how are we going to, and when it looks
[SPEAKER_09]: like they're going to get stressed,
and certainly we need to harvest before
[SPEAKER_09]: frost.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, that will be taken into account,
and my guess is that we'll probably,
[SPEAKER_09]: depending on the weather state,
sometime between mid to end of September,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then bank our 20 days on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I was talking about plant architecture
and height, and how do we take into
[SPEAKER_09]: account any pruning that might happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, we are not doing any pruning at
all.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are, of course, some leaves that
drop, but we're not doing any pruning for
[SPEAKER_09]: this particular trial.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in future trials, we'll be doing
pruning to make clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, for my part of the experiment,
I won't be doing pruning to make clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Larry can have thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the issue is the material transfer
agreements under which we obtained this
[SPEAKER_13]: material.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, if we are restricted against
cultivating it and propagating it from
[SPEAKER_13]: cuttings, we won't do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: For that material that we are allowed to
make cuttings, we will probably try to do
[SPEAKER_13]: that, and again, use that material for
breeding and cloning.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think I'll mention one more project
that we're working on, which is to,
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure many of you have seen the phylo
galaxy, if you haven't, you should go take
[SPEAKER_13]: a look at it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Phylos Biosciences, that's with a
P-H-N-Y-O-S, is a company based in
[SPEAKER_13]: Portland that will analyze the DNA of your
hemp or marijuana plant and compare it
[SPEAKER_13]: with everything else that they've got in
their database.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they have thousands of samples in
their database.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it's very cool to look at which
cultivars are related to one another
[SPEAKER_13]: genetically.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a 23andme or ancestry.com
analysis for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Phylos, P-H-Y-L-O-S.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a very cool web interface where
you can zoom through the phylo galaxy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we are trying to do the same thing for
the CBD cultivars that folks are growing
[SPEAKER_13]: in New York State.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have already collected small samples
from four different farms to extract DNA
[SPEAKER_13]: to do that type of genetic fingerprinting
analysis.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you see we're already up to 35
different names of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_13]: The question is, are those true to type?
[SPEAKER_13]: None of these were purchased under a
certified seed program that would verify
[SPEAKER_13]: that they are true to type.
[SPEAKER_13]: How related are they to one another?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there genetic differences between these
that would be of interest for us in our
[SPEAKER_13]: breeding program?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I know there are a number of growers
here I want to connect with where I
[SPEAKER_13]: haven't been able to sample yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're willing to help me go and collect
some small heat samples for DNA
[SPEAKER_13]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is something we hope to be able to
publish next year is when you buy a
[SPEAKER_13]: cascade or lichter or elytra from the
Crawford Brothers.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it really any different from buying
cherry wine or cherry blossom from
[SPEAKER_13]: Centennial Seed?
[SPEAKER_13]: Off the top of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I think that brings a formal
presentation to a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I'm really sorry we can't make it
out to the field, but I would like to open
[SPEAKER_13]: it up and give folks an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you need to take off, you can take off.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you have questions, I'd like to
open it up for a general question and
[SPEAKER_00]: answer session now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
you
