[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks, Neil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good afternoon, everyone,
and thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really means a great deal to
me that you would show up today to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about this presentation on the work that I
have been conducting over the past two
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I often get asked the question,
why would you work on a crop that is so
[SPEAKER_00]: small and, well, so meaningful?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first came into this,
I asked myself, where do I want to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: and where do I want to take this degree?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things that came to
mind was work with a traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse cultivated crop, such as
tomatoes or lettuce, and doing some work
[SPEAKER_00]: with lighting or production systems as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I became more introduced into New
York's greenhouse industry, I became so
[SPEAKER_00]: infatuated with just how many growers are
less than 10,000 square feet, about 85% to
[SPEAKER_00]: be exact, that I got this urge to help the
little guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Neil, my advisor, took me around
various operations, I began to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: trend in the cultivation of these
microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of these growers we visited,
let's call them Timothy Farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: started asking Neil and I questions about
these crops and the difficulty they were
[SPEAKER_00]: having in producing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we went to visit these subsequent
operations, days or weeks and months to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow, I began to notice that regardless
of experience or size, growers were
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling with reliably producing these
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became very apparent very quickly
that the source of this trouble stemmed
[SPEAKER_00]: from factors many of us often take for
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: In well-established crops, this being
simple production protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is where my work really began
and is well-defined in my thesis as two
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter one really focused on this idea of
establishing optimal cultural practices
[SPEAKER_00]: for the production of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were seed density, substrate depth,
fertilizer concentration, with nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: being the focal point for adjustment,
and air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I established optimal cultural
practices that resulted in reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, I started chapter two of my
research, which looked at the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: varying daily light integral and carbon
dioxide concentration on the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I really began and dive into
the work that I've been conducting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to step back for a moment and
define what microgreens truly are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most people know the difference
between sprouts, and baby leaf greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the best way to define a
microgreen is by sticking them right
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, a microgreen is just a vegetable
or herb harvested shortly after emergence
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first true leaf or leaves,
but prior to true leaf development and
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence of the cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the drivers for growers to
start producing these crops is their high
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: This falls in the range of roughly $65 to
$110 per kilogram of fresh weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be highly incentivizing for
growers as a supplementary income source.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, because their growing period only
goes between 10 to 20 days, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a protected cultivation crop
due to their sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with very little known about these
crops, there's only a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: publications primarily focusing on their
nutritional content and the effects of
[SPEAKER_00]: variations in light regimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the image on this slide is a prime
example of the variability you can find in
[SPEAKER_00]: microgreens, where this particular example
does not meet the attributes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: definition I just put forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you might be asking yourself,
what is the driver for this crop that is
[SPEAKER_00]: so small yet so expensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did not conduct any consumer
preference research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been numerous publications
across various social outlets praising the
[SPEAKER_00]: health-promoting benefits of microgreens
and the elegance that they impart on any
[SPEAKER_00]: dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, this article by NPR is one of the
most accurate representations of the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could find, serving as a healthy
side of science with your microgreen
[SPEAKER_00]: salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, experiments to establish the various
cultural practices on the growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, and days to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these crops were really targeted
towards the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this meant was that the experiments
that we wanted to devise needed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: obtainable by the average small-scale
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I pointed out earlier, these manifested
in treatments for seed density,
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate depth, fertilizer concentration,
and air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why this is important is
because when you purchase seed from a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company, the recommendations made by the
various seed companies vary widely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, these recommendations are not
species- or genus-specific, nor do they
[SPEAKER_00]: vary by seed size or plant growth habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you receive your seed in the mail,
the back of the package has a general
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptor recommending an average of 1.1
seeds per square centimeter of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: area and two temperature recommendations,
24 degrees C for germination and 16
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens if the grower's
temperatures are not within those
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about if the grower's media is
expensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whose isn't?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to get the best bang for
their buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: With many microgreens sold in the
containers in which they are grown in,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no room for poor stand
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over or under seeding can result in an
unappealing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these pictures here are just a small
subset of images that I have stored on my
[SPEAKER_00]: computer from growers who struggle with
reliably producing these crops simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't know where to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image on the top is from an aquaponics
operation that, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_00]: is struggling from seed density issues,
irregular development rates, and in
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous flats, extensive disease
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The image on the bottom is from an
operation that truly believed that
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing these crops was unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I initially started with 15 different
species, and through trials, I narrowed it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to three distinct species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are a number of reasons why I
chose three and only three, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily chosen due to their presence in
local markets, similarity in seed size and
[SPEAKER_00]: number of days from seeding to harvest,
and variability in sensory attributes.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there are upwards of 70 different
varieties to choose from, I chose only
[SPEAKER_00]: three based on limitations in experimental
design from a hardware standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you will see in my discussion of the
DLI and CO2 component in my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first parameter that I really
looked at was seed density.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you purchase a bag of seed from
Johnny's Seed, for example, they recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: an average of 1.1 seeds per square
centimeter of growing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I utilized this rate,
I noticed that it happened to result in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of unused media, which in turn
resulted in a relatively sparse canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the cost of substrate, seed,
and other input variables, I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: find that optimal density that resulted in
greatest growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I investigated five different seeding
densities, four of which corresponded to
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% increments in density above the
recommended rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was that population fresh
weight increased in a quadratic fashion
[SPEAKER_00]: for all three species as seed density
increased from 1.1 to 3.3 seeds per square
centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side, fresh weight per plant
decreased in a quadratic fashion for all
[SPEAKER_00]: three species as seed density increased
from 1.1 to 3.3 seeds per square
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something that we expected to
see due to competition for resources such
[SPEAKER_00]: as light and growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did not start to see this reduced
population yield component until 2.5 times
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommended seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something that we expected to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really great for growers because
it allows them to get the best bang for
[SPEAKER_00]: their buck and make the most out of their
bench space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though this factor of reduced
population or even though this fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: weight per plant decreased, that had no
noticeable effect on the maturity rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regardless of your density,
the crop is sitting on the bench for the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's best to utilize that space as
efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next factor we looked at was substrate
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I visited growers in the area,
I happened to notice that many of them
[SPEAKER_00]: only utilized a small fraction of the
volume of a standard 10 by 20 inch tray
[SPEAKER_00]: with substrate depths often as shallow as
only one to two centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the principle behind using less
substrate is feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's face it, these crops are
only growing for 10 to 20 days after which
[SPEAKER_00]: all those inputs are then composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But given these crops high density and
high competition for resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be using less substrate may be
counterproductive to their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a result, I looked at four
different substrate depths ranging from
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.8 to 5.8 centimeters per cell or roughly
86 to 278 cubic centimeters per cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response of fresh weight to increasing
substrate depth was positively quadratic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was really interesting was that there
was no statistical difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: species or their response to changes in
substrate depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this happens to be very convenient
because obtaining a substrate depth at
[SPEAKER_00]: container capacity, at a capacity at 4.3
centimeters, also happens to be roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as if you fill the container to
pot height using bag moisture content
[SPEAKER_00]: media and subsequently water in the
container capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this one line fits all response
was not reciprocated in dry weight where
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects of substrate depth was not
only linear but also varied by species
[SPEAKER_00]: with arugula having a 30% greater response
to increases in substrate depth than
[SPEAKER_00]: mizuna or mizuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was not uncommon though,
as the lack of collinearity between fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry weight, as you will see,
was also observed in other treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: a trend that was shared with other
literature regarding the relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: between fresh and dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is worth, however, noting that for
sales of microgreens, fresh weight is the
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred yield determinant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, greater weight is placed
on that parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the important observations
that was noted in this experiment was the
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency for either the lowest or highest
substrate depths to exhibit either rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture loss, as was the case with the
1.8 centimeter treatment, or excessive
[SPEAKER_00]: water holding capacity, as was the case
with the 5.8 centimeter treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that growers need to have a
stronger grasp on their irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling or if they already utilize
either of these two treatment levels to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid the potential of extensive crop
losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in greenhouse operations,
it is an undeniable fact that fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, regardless of its source,
be it organic or inorganic, is a required
[SPEAKER_00]: input for the successful growth of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, microgreens low short production
period does allow them to be produced in
[SPEAKER_00]: the absence of supplemental fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this trait is often to the
detriment of their production,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many growers interpret this as not
needing to fertilize, even if a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: source is on hand in the same greenhouse
or other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this experiment, I wanted to look at
the effects of fertilizer concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: using a constant liquid feed of 21,
2.2, 16.6 NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: At five nitrogen fertilizer
concentrations, 0, 50, 100, 150,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 200 milligrams nitrogen per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this experiment was designed to take
advantage of the constant liquid feed
[SPEAKER_00]: systems that are already in place in most
greenhouse operations and will be utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: at each irrigation interval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Results were nearly identical to that of
the only other publication on microgreen
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and very similar to that of
mature and comparable crops, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, where fresh weight increased in a
quadratic fashion as fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration increased from 0 to 200
milligrams nitrogen per liter,
[SPEAKER_00]: with reduced gains in fresh weight above
100 to 150 milligrams nitrogen per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this response also varied by species,
where arugula had a stronger response to
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in fertilizer concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: many operations only have one or two
fertilizer proportioning units,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it may be necessary to standardize with
a single fertilizer concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, dry weight also exhibited the same
species variation, however, under the
[SPEAKER_00]: influence of a positive linear model
instead of a quadratic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the images that the drastic
differences between the 0 and 200
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram nitrogen per liter treatment,
where the 0 milligram treatment had
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially less growth than the 200
milligram treatment, which in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: arugula produced an almost undesirable
proliferation of growth at the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment level, which could intrude on
surrounding cells, making harvest more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, depending on how we define protected
cultivation, the large variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: structures utilized to provide this
function vary considerably in their
[SPEAKER_00]: insulating properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: For small growers with more seasonal type
structures, increased heating costs can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence them to change their heating
point thresholds, reducing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can have a significant effect on
crop development rate amongst other
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: With microgreens, crop timing is crucial
to sales, as development rates are rapidly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing during this exponential growth
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: With most growers selling direct to the
consumer through farmers markets or
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant contracts, consistency in
quality and delivery times is fundamental
[SPEAKER_00]: to the success of the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this in mind, I investigated four
different temperature treatments and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of days to harvest of microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, 16, 20, and 22 degrees C were chosen
as 24-hour growing temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: where plants were started at germination
and grown through to harvest at each of
[SPEAKER_00]: the levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was that as temperatures
increased from 14 to 22 degrees C,
[SPEAKER_00]: days to harvest decreased in a linear
fashion, hastening production time by
[SPEAKER_00]: seven days for arugula, six days for
mizuna, and eight days for mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, being able to produce a crop six to
eight days faster is huge if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, it allows you to get in more
crop cycles per year, which could mean
[SPEAKER_00]: greater profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect of temperature control is
that regardless of your set point,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a consistent temperature allows for
greater control of crop timing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which permits a consistent, which allows,
helps with producing a consistent crop any
[SPEAKER_00]: day of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the image on the bottom left is very
telling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it shows crop development rates
for the 14, 16, and 20 degrees C
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments when the 22 degrees C treatment
was ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even though this work I investigated
establishes responses for the various
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters explored in this research,
I did not conduct a full factorial
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, it is unknown whether
interactions between parameters could have
[SPEAKER_00]: a substantial influence on the effects on
their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless of this fact, these results
may possess value to growers who wish to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate these responses into their
production protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, we can summarize
results, individually optimized results,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the expectation that interactions
would not drastically change the
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on my findings, initial parameters
may be to sow seed at a rate of 2.75 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: per square centimeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A growing area broadcasted over a
peat-like mix at a height of 4.3
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers could then fertilize at a rate of
150 milligrams of nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently grow the crop out in a
greenhouse at a 24-hour temperature of 22
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, these values are not set
in stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers do not have the luxury of
optimizing their growing environment for
[SPEAKER_00]: these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is perfectly all right,
because using the regression model,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are able to make predictions about
values that were not explicitly trialed in
[SPEAKER_00]: this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as the growers obtainable values
fall within the range of treatments
[SPEAKER_00]: explored in each experiment, they can have
a very good idea of the results that they
[SPEAKER_00]: may obtain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I established a small handful
of cultural practices that resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: marketable and consistent growth,
I wanted to look at other factors that
[SPEAKER_00]: resulted in increased growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of you sitting here today are
probably quite familiar with the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: climate we have here in Ithaca,
New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather is often gloomy, and in the
winter months, days are quite short,
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in less total accumulated light
per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to the human eye, this is more than
enough light to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for plants, these are very low daily
accumulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most species in this region
during this period are not actively
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesizing and are in a state of
dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is what a greenhouse permits us,
the ability to continue producing crops
[SPEAKER_00]: year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: But therein lies the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we are able to protect these
crops from the environment, the low levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of light during this period are often the
less likely limiting factor in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, some growers opt to
utilize supplemental lighting to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: their average daily photosynthetically
active radiation levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the graph on this page,
we have the average daily number of moles
[SPEAKER_00]: per square meter on the y-axis,
moles of light per square meter on the
[SPEAKER_00]: y-axis, and days of the year in Julian
days on the x-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plotted over the course of 13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see is that although total
daily accumulations are higher during the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer months, the total variability
across the year is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a nice summer day, we can get as
high as 65 moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also get as low as around 5
moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, during the winter, these values are
much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a nice day in winter, we can only
get about 15 moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a very cloudy day, we can get less
than one mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: To put this into perspective, a crop like
lettuce produces maximum growth at around
[SPEAKER_00]: 17 moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For microgreens, the tolerance to low
light is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also respond positively to
increased levels of light to about 18
[SPEAKER_00]: moles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issue arises that when you wish to
produce maximum growth on days when your
[SPEAKER_00]: natural light is less than 1 18th of its
potential, the vast majority of your
[SPEAKER_00]: growth is coming at the expense of
electrical energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, no matter how you work this,
the use of electricity to power electric
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to feed growth is an expensive
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we looked at total
daily accumulated light levels at four
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of 3, 6, 9, and 12 moles per square
meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under a full factorial experiment,
cross those with four CO2 concentrations
[SPEAKER_00]: of 400, 600, 800, and 1,000 parts per
million to see if light and CO2 had any
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on yields, morphology, days to
harvest, and secondary metabolite content
[SPEAKER_00]: of these microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first response we looked at was
fresh weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, the effects of increasing
DLI from 3 to 12 moles per square meter
[SPEAKER_00]: per day was species dependent,
where mizuna and mustard increased in a
[SPEAKER_00]: linear fashion, while arugula increased in
a quadratic fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, fresh weight for arugula was
also more responsive to changes in DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: between 3 and 9 moles per square meter per
day compared to mizuna and mustard,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were not significantly different
from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the importance of CO2 in plant growth
cannot be understated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequestering of carbon from atmospheric
carbon dioxide can significantly influence
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, and in some cases act as a buffer
to augment against lower daily
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulations of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is most important is that under the
correct conditions, CO2 can be a far more
[SPEAKER_00]: economical means of increasing yields as
compared to electricity for supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For microgreens, the effects of increasing
CO2 from 400 to 1,000 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: was linear for all three species with no
significant difference between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was also observed was that at lower
levels of light, for example, 6 moles
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to 9 moles, an elevated CO2
concentration of 1,000 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: resulted in equivalent or greater growth
than the higher light treatment at an
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient CO2 concentration of 400 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: For dry weight, the response of all three
species was linear, as DLI and CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: increased from 3 to 12 moles per square
meter per day and 400 to 1,000 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much like fresh weight, but to a lesser
degree, CO2 at 1,000 parts per million
[SPEAKER_00]: could be utilized to counteract reductions
of 3 moles at 400 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the image in this slide shows arugula
at two different image angles,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the top two images were taken at 3
moles, while the bottom two were taken at
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 moles, with CO2 concentrations of 400
to 1,000 ordered left to right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while CO2 has shown that it can have
a significantly positive impact on both
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh and dry weights, it did not appear
to have an effect on days to harvest of
[SPEAKER_00]: either mizuna, arugula, or mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For days to harvest, the only parameter
that had a significant effect was daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral, which responded in a
negative quadratic fashion for mizuna and
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard, and a negative linear fashion for
arugula, as DLI increased from 3 to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is really quite interesting,
because it adds a level of complexity,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the grower could then decide whether
increased yields or the rate of turnover
[SPEAKER_00]: is more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: in their operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if a grower has a contract
where they are required to produce trays
[SPEAKER_00]: that fall within a designated fresh weight
range, then it may make more sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to increase their daily light
integral to hasten production,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than increasing CO2 to simply
increase growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would allow the grower to meet their
designated fresh weight range while
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a crop more quickly,
which could mean that the grower would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to increase their production and get
paid more based on a higher volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the last response I'm going to talk
about was the production of total phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, phenolic compounds have been
overwhelmingly praised for the
[SPEAKER_00]: health-promoting benefits they impart on
the human body when ingested.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because, in plant-derived food
products, phenolic compounds constitute
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of antioxidants, which have
been linked to reductions in various
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic diseases, such as cancers and
cardiovascular diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the results that I obtained were
quite interesting, because they appear to
[SPEAKER_00]: support this populous idea that
microgreens are more nutritious than their
[SPEAKER_00]: mature counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all three species, total phenolic
content, represented in milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: gallic acid equivalents per 100 grams of
fresh weight tissue, increased in a linear
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion as DLI increased from 3 to 12
moles per square meter per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, there was a significant
interaction between DLI and CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the effects of DLI increased as CO2
concentrations increased from 400 to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CO2, on its own, did not have a
significant effect on total phenolics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the three species, arugula exhibited
the greatest total phenolic content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But was the least responsive to changes in
DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although my results showed, for example,
that arugula had about the same total
[SPEAKER_00]: phenolic content as its mature
counterparts at 105 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was obtained at just 12 moles per
square meter per day and 1,000 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast, mature arugula, with roughly
the same total phenolic content in
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting literature, was grown at a DLI
of over 20 moles per square meter per day
[SPEAKER_00]: at ambient CO2 concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this model does not permit an
extrapolation to values as high as 20
[SPEAKER_00]: moles, other supporting literature on the
response of microgreen phenolic content to
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in DLI have shown responses or
increases as high as 30 moles,
[SPEAKER_00]: while still seeing a positive response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue, however, is the variability in
the data, or the variability in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature, where total phenolic content
for the same species vary widely by
[SPEAKER_00]: publication and method of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, it is hard to draw a
definitive conclusion about the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of microgreens over their mature
counterparts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can say is that growers can
expect their microgreen arugula,
[SPEAKER_00]: mizuna, and mustard to have greater total
phenolic content if grown under a DLI of
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 moles in comparison to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most interesting conclusions
that was made that came out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: research was the very consistent tendency
for there to be no statistically
[SPEAKER_00]: significant difference between the
responses of mizuna and mustard,
[SPEAKER_00]: while both were consistently and
significantly different from arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could be due to the fact that mizuna
and mustard, although different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: are of the same genus, different from that
of arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least within the scope of this
research, it may be possible to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: mizuna and mustard as the same crop,
while separately optimizing parameters for
[SPEAKER_00]: arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the more recent trends in
agriculture is the production of crops
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, such as in vertical production
greenhouses or warehouse type plant
[SPEAKER_00]: factories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to dive too deep into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microgreens' low light requirements and
significant responses to the increases in
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 could make it a potential crop for
indoor production environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as in sole source lighting
facilities, which is inferior to a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional greenhouse within the
continental US from an energy standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you could ask, is this crop just a
fad?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it going to go away when the market
becomes saturated?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough to say, but with the first
publication conducted in 2004,
[SPEAKER_00]: this crop has only been increasing in
popularity, with new publications being
[SPEAKER_00]: added on what seems like a bimonthly
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, I'm inclined to say that
they are here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I would like to thank you for
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you, you know,
showing up for my work, and I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask if any of you have any questions at
this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
So, wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first question, so it's sort of
two-fold, but my first one is I found it
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting that the phenolic
content was greatest in arugula.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you mentioned that if you increase the
temperature, you can get them to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: By almost seven days, do you expect the
phenolic content to decrease, or is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Decrease under what light treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So under a?
[SPEAKER_02]: Decrease if it grows faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you modify the temperature and
it's growing faster, would you expect
[SPEAKER_02]: there to be any difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the phenolic content was a response
as a stress factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the crop gets more light,
and there's more photons of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it produces more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more of these secondary
metabolites as a response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing temperatures and growing
faster, I would probably say it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have an effect on the total amount of
phenolic accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the light and CO2 research,
those were grown at 24 degrees C,
[SPEAKER_00]: day and night temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a colder temperature,
I would say it probably wouldn't affect
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I didn't test that, so I can't
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, another question is,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so I know you said that the literature
is sort of inconclusive, and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: test the phenolic content in mature
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you taken the arugula
micro-granite and allowed it to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: mature, and then tested the phenolic
content to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in literature, that's one thing that is
lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have a lot of the work that
initially came out in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of the total phenolic content
in vitamin and carotenoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was people purchased these
micro-greens from consumers, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: tested these levels against purchased
mature equivalent crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that basis, you don't have an idea
of what the total DLI levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, CO2, humidity, all those
factors were unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody, to my knowledge, has actually
grown them side by side under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, under controlled conditions,
and then measured those values.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the next work that could be
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would the days-to-harvest decrease with
the air-temperature experiments that you
[SPEAKER_03]: ran?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see any negative impacts on crop
quality associated with the higher
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures than you were supposed to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any sort of tip-burn, I guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see these crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Erica's talking about is in
lettuce, we say that 17 moles is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: this target point for production,
because if you go over that, you start
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in tip-burn, which is related to
calcium and calcium uptake and
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's ways to combat that with
movement of air around the head of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in micro-greens, and even to my
knowledge, when the crops are very small,
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce crops, you don't see that tip-burn
when you really promote those high levels
[SPEAKER_00]: of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we didn't go any higher
than 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in most of the greenhouse situations,
as I was showing you in Ithaca,
[SPEAKER_00]: the variability in light levels is so high
that there weren't that many days where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're growing where the light inside the
greenhouse, which is lower than light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's outside anyways due to losses,
that those were high enough to impart any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of tip-burn effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short, we didn't see any.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of reduced quality effects,
at the highest temperature of 22 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: C, I did tend to see more disease
development at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be more due to just there
being, depending on which greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in, there are variations,
other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the chamber work that we did,
which was at 24 degrees C, or 23 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: C, actually, we had no disease
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a sterile environment,
not sterile, but a cleaner environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there better airflow around the crop
in the chamber rather than in the
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should go back to this, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually what I talked about
when I referenced the limitations in
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental design.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the hardware standpoint, we had the
three species of crops in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each chamber would have a different
airflow rate depending on the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purpose of the algorithms that run
with when to start dosing, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on the levels of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And inside these units, up here on this
little mass, there's a fan here that
[SPEAKER_00]: distributes the air around and tends to,
it has a variable fan rate that moves more
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly when there's higher CO2 levels
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a factor that's a level of
variability that's in the data that's
[SPEAKER_00]: unaccounted for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were talking about the
cultural practices, you kind of ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that a lot of growers don't have
the luxury of making sure all of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you went on to put it more
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important one that I would say
that they need to standardize is their
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be simply the most important
from a quality standpoint, from a
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducibility standpoint, which would
always go obviously back to the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: structure they're getting, whether it's a
single layer polyhouse that they use more
[SPEAKER_00]: for seasonal extension, or if it's a
double layer poly with insulated air
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier, or if it's a higher quality
single layer glass, they need to establish
[SPEAKER_00]: those temperature controls before anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next most important I would say would
be seed density, simply because when
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, I didn't give exact
recommendations or specifications on the
[SPEAKER_00]: variability by companies, but there are
companies out there, and I list this in my
[SPEAKER_00]: thesis, Johnny Seed is probably the
largest supplier of these crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of other newcomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it's Mountain Mist Company,
but they recommend what they say is one
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce of seed per 10 inch by 20 inch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, it's just unreasonable to
utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That much seed for that small of an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that growers need to
be aware of, is to not necessarily always
[SPEAKER_00]: follow those recommendations that are
given on the back of the bag, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: stated, regardless of what you buy,
if you buy beet seed, which you can fit
[SPEAKER_00]: five to seven different, seven arugula
seeds within that volume of a beet seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have the same exact seeding rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, got a question over here
first that you were asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a minor question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that through your graph,
that arugula, the optimal fertilization
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration was about 200 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimal, so from the statistical
model, the optimal is 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question was just because you made a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so it seems like the optimal
concentration was 200, but your
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation was to use 150 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, so the reason for that is this
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In picture A, this is arugula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is these cells,
there's 24 of these cells in an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to grow it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I grew it simply to have
replicates per tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers just simply fill up a shallow
tray with substrate to a certain height,
[SPEAKER_00]: broadcast the seed over the entire thing,
and then harvest it as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of producers that
grow it in these type of situations where
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a tray with 24 cells inside that
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they sell those individual cells
individually over the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they ship them out, and they take them
to farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is when you promote that
much fresh weight development and that
[SPEAKER_00]: much mass through fertilizer increases,
you start to get this to growth that just
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes completely overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is, as you can see there,
it folds over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an entirely a lodging
situation, because the stems are still
[SPEAKER_00]: intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they fold over on the other cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when you go in to separate them,
and all this is done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all hand harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going with scissors to separate those
cells, you all of a sudden have
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwined stems and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those leaves, especially at the higher
fertilizer concentrations, are very soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start to get torn tissue and
bruising of the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you harvest a crop like
this at 100 milligrams or 150,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have as much of that intrusion
cell to cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, you can separate them much
more easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you do get more fresh
weight growth and dry weight growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: arugula at that 200, it's not worth that
trade-off of losing that amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the interesting things is part
of this reduction, it may not have been
[SPEAKER_00]: completely quadratic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there is that reduction in
yield by losing product through harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could have certainly influenced that
quadratic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't really get away from that
unless you produce them in cells
[SPEAKER_00]: separated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a personal consumer production
standpoint, I'd like to address just the
[SPEAKER_04]: media options that we might have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you suggest a feed-light mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd understand that for production,
systemizing production and making it
[SPEAKER_04]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've seen all kinds of various mats
and sheets and fiber-based products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you just talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to this picture because this is
two good examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top image is produced on a burlap
sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was they floated that over
an aquaponics pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have that essentially on,
I can't remember the exact mechanism that
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to float it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how they did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seeded it on this burlap sack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this grower here, this was a standard,
I think this was a standard peat-light
[SPEAKER_00]: type mix that they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, and there's been a lot of
research actually, different producers
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work that's been done in terms
of just simply from a light, when they
[SPEAKER_00]: look at different qualities or quantity of
light, they utilize these growing mats
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of the peat-light mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are advantages in controllability
between these because what I use is LM111,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a standard, typical commercial
type peat-light mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does have a starting charge in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are aware of what the nutritional
content of that is to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus these mats, they come with no
starting charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are pretty inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their cation exchange capacity is often
quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows a lot of that individual
control if you're doing a hydroponic-type
[SPEAKER_00]: float environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of yield variation, the
difference in the literature depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have seen equivalent or
greater growth with these mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they utilize a standard peat-light
mix, but they don't specify, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: say what level they used or the depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is the fiber-type mats,
not this particularly, but there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber mats that are wood-based pulps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they compress into a mat and you open
it up, you stick it in the flat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it hydrates itself, and it rises to about
a centimeter tall at full saturation
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done very minor trials with them,
not experiencing the best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to hold water for excessively
long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seedlings in general are very
susceptible to damping off disease issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tended to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also liked the ability to utilize one
substrate across just about all your
[SPEAKER_00]: different crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult, you know,
if you are ordering materials and you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, you don't want to be ordering 10
different substrates, different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a couple substrates from
different suppliers, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: redundancy so you don't have one supplier
goes under, you're not out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's an easy product to get a
hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many companies produce them versus those
mats, there's only a small handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Substrate per tray in this case actually
have the full numbers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total cost per square meter of
production utilizing this system for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed and substrate is $4 for arugula,
$5.41 for mizuna, and $6.47 for mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that varies primarily based on the
rate of what seed is going for at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, because that's pretty variable in
terms of when you check Johnny Seed or
[SPEAKER_00]: other seed companies, those prices vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you purchase one of those mats,
for example, just one tray and you get 6.6
[SPEAKER_00]: trays per square meter, just one tray,
the substrate for those different mats is
[SPEAKER_00]: about $1.60.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't reuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're done, you throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's versus it's about $0.40 or so
for the substrate per tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
