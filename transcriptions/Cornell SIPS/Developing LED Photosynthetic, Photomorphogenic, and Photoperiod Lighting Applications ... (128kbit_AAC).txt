[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Neil, for the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically today what I'm going to do
is I'm going to talk to you all about the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that we've been doing at Purdue with
LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our greenhouses at Purdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, our LEDs nice and glow
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of a floor culture,
and we can talk about other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: we tend to really focus on light quantity,
light quality, as well as light duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with each of these, we can manipulate
them to have our crops do specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with light quantity, we primarily use
high pressure sodium or metal halide lamps
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase the daylight integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: With light quality, we can use filters or
shading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with photo period, primarily
growers would use incandescent lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously those are being phased out of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately these are the responses that
we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have LEDs which we can use to
basically look at photosynthetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: photomorphogenic, as well as photoperiodic
light responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the primary areas of research
for me is lighting of young plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is primarily because when we
think of northern latitudes, this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we often see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see very low daily light integrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for propagators, they really want to
minimize the amount of time that those
[SPEAKER_00]: young plants are in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to optimize the quality and also
just reduce that timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of the photosynthetic daily
light integral outdoors in the north,
[SPEAKER_00]: we typically have anywhere from 5 to 20
moles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to produce a high quality young plant,
research has shown that we want to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: within the 10 to 12 mole range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we move within a greenhouse,
we can have further reductions of anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from 50% or less due to the structures,
the glazing material, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can ultimately have a daily light
integral within a greenhouse during peak
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation of anywhere from 1 to 5 moles,
which is quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically two maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the average
greenhouse daily light integral in
[SPEAKER_00]: February.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is when we're propagating a lot of
cuttings and also growing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the average greenhouse daily
light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in the north,
there's a large benefit in terms of using
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting to get that target
DLI of 10 to 12 moles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been doing research with rooting
of cuttings for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is work that we looked at using high
pressure sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, when you increase that
daily light integral, you obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that root dry mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with more branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ultimately can get that cutting out
of the production house much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at northern latitudes,
especially like, say, New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan, daily light integrals in this
range are not uncommon during that time
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work done at Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that here what they've
done is they basically have looked at when
[SPEAKER_00]: to use high pressure sodium lighting,
whether it's early on or later on in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plug production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the effects of obviously
providing supplemental light during three
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, it reduces the time to
produce that plug, but also increases the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at biomass production,
it's very cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that root dry mass increases
with increasing daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, each species responds
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that photosynthesis also increases
as we would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, what we're looking at is
this is that stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start to see that as daily
light integral increases, photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads me to the first study that
we're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some work that my former graduate
student, Chris Curry, worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically wanted to look at
supplemental lighting using various
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we basically looked at
LEDs where we had 100% red light and no
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had increasing amounts of blue
light from anywhere from 15% to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had our control, which was our
high pressure sodium lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we provided 70 micromoles of light for
16 hours each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our spectral quality for the
various LEDs and, of course, the high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see our different peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our high pressure sodium and
our increasing amount of blue light from
[SPEAKER_00]: zero all the way up to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the one thing that you notice
between both the impatiens and the petunia
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of above and below ground
biomass?
[SPEAKER_01]: They look pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were virtually no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it depends on who you're
talking with, whether that's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also looked at photosynthesis for
the three species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, we had the same
photosynthetic rates under high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium lamps or under 100% red or with
increasing amounts of blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is then we grew the plants
under a common environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took them out of propagation and we
placed them into a greenhouse with 20
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius and a target daily light
integral of 10 to 12 moles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finished them to see if there were
any residual effects of basically
[SPEAKER_00]: propagating them under high pressure
sodium lamps or LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we did not see any difference
in time to flower, height at flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes below the first flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, some of the conclusions that we
were able to make from this study is that
[SPEAKER_00]: there were very few statistical
differences among the cuttings when we
[SPEAKER_00]: used various sources of supplemental
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there were few differences
among flowering plant responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were no beneficial or detrimental
effects of using LEDs for vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our next study, we wanted to basically
look at seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think of a cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get a cutting, it obviously
comes from either Central or South America
[SPEAKER_00]: or Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cutting spends about a week in
the greenhouse forming callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's in the greenhouse anywhere
from two to three weeks more.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have a seedling, that seedling,
we place it under lights right after
[SPEAKER_00]: germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the greenhouse anywhere from
three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically had similar lights,
so 100% red, 85% red, 15% blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the 70 and 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had different LEDs that we used in this
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we increased our light intensity to
100 micromoles for 16 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's our spectral distribution
for the various LEDs, as well as the high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used a wide variety of bedding
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically the top 10 bedding
plants that are produced in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to present to you today the
petunia just because of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the seedlings, we definitely saw
a dramatic difference between those that
[SPEAKER_00]: were produced under LEDs versus the high
pressure sodium lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here what we're looking at is the stem
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with plugs, we want them to be nice and
compact because one grower is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce them, place them in a box,
and ship them to another grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want these plugs to be nice and
compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that under high pressure
sodium lamps, they were much more taller
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we used blue light, we tended to
have even more compact seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at stem caliper,
there were basically no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of stem caliper, we want a
sturdy seedling that's going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: withstand transportation, not break in
that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of root dry mass, obviously root
dry mass is important because if those
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings root faster, they're going to be
rooted into that plug tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were basically not a whole lot of
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference were between the 85
percent red, 15 percent blue, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70-30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with shoot dry mass, not a lot of
difference as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we wanted to grow these plants
out in a common environment, see if there
[SPEAKER_00]: were any residual effects of the
supplemental lighting during propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, they pretty much
all flowered at very similar times,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there were no statistical differences
as well as the height at flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found that plug quality was similar,
whether the seedlings were growing under
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lamps or under LEDs,
or in some instances, they were of better
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the finished plant quality was not
significantly influenced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this led to the next study where
there's been an interest by U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: growers of producing plugs indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look at whether we could
produce a high-quality bedding plant
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling indoors using sole-source
lighting versus producing a plug in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we maintained a
23-degree constant day and night
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, and we wanted to achieve a
daily light integral of about 10.5 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the greenhouse, we wanted to achieve
that with sunlight plus supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, and in the grow chamber,
we wanted to achieve that just with
[SPEAKER_00]: sole-source LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the different treatments that
we had in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a no supplemental lighting
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided we didn't, obviously in the
two previous studies, we didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that when I talked
to growers, I obviously have an extension
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment, they often don't realize the
benefits of using supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to really show them that there
are differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of our supplemental
lighting treatments, those lights were on
[SPEAKER_00]: for 16 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provided 70 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a high-pressure sodium lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also used plasma lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had one LED treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had one that had 88% red and 12%
blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the grow chambers, we looked at two
light qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the same as in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had another treatment that had
18% more blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our various treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had our high-pressure sodium,
our greenhouse LEDs, and then our plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here are two sole-source
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a multi-layer production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our spectral distribution for the
various light treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was probably, in terms of the
studies that we did with young plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can definitely see that there are some
major differences between the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced in the greenhouse,
so the ambient high-pressure sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma, and then this supplemental LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the differences between those
that were produced in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the ones that were produced under
sole-source LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the data a little closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those that were produced under plasma
lamps were quite elongated compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other supplemental lighting treatments,
as well as under sole-source lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that the relative
chlorophyll content, so we basically used
[SPEAKER_00]: a spad meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you provided supplemental light or
sole-source light, we definitely saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: the relative chlorophyll content
increased, but a big increase under
[SPEAKER_00]: sole-source lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of leaf area, leaf area increased
when you provided, obviously, more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of root dry mass, as we would
expect, compared to the ambient control,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the one thing I forgot to mention is
the ambient treatment, we had about six
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half moles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was obviously from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were providing an additional
four moles from the supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw an increase in terms of our root
dry mass, but the highest occurred under
[SPEAKER_00]: sole-source lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had an increase in shoot dry
mass, but it was relatively similar
[SPEAKER_00]: between the various lighting treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we finished the crop under a
common environment to see if there were
[SPEAKER_00]: any residual effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is where we did see some
differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the differences that you see
is, obviously, petunias are a long-day
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, so they require long days in order
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under our ambient conditions in the
winter, after three weeks, they had not
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plasma lamps provide quite a bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that obviously helped in terms of time
to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high-pressure sodium, there is a
flower bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here, what we can see is that when we
had only 12% blue light, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were providing about 22 micromoles of
blue light, there was a delay in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a significant delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But work that's been done at Michigan
State has actually shown that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: blue light to basically use blue light
instead of far-red light to induce
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering responses in floriculture crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually going to do some more
work in this area this coming winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of time to flower,
you definitely see that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heighted flower, in terms of
horticulturally, those differences were
[SPEAKER_00]: not very significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found in this study that the quality
of bedding plant seedlings produced under
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting was similar or
greater to those grown under ambient
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the seedlings of the species that we
studied were of higher quality or similar
[SPEAKER_00]: quality when they were grown under sole
source lighting when we compared those to
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only two species where we found
that there was a difference in time to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower was impatiens and the petunia that
I showed you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that sole source lighting is
a viable option for growers who would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce bedding plant seedlings indoors
because they can obviously control the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters, not only the light,
but also temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and carbon dioxide, which is going to
produce uniform seedlings throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: peak production cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a study that we basically just
finished up a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just got the data from my
student a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Josh, well, there's two Josh's,
but Josh Garavak wanted to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: producing microgreens indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to basically look at both
light quantity as well as light quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had three species that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used basically a fiber hydroponic tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pad, and I'll show you a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our environmental set points were 21
during the day, 17 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we maintained a relative humidity
of 50 during the day and 60 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had a set point of 500 parts
per million CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the LEDs that we used in this
study, we used the same LEDs that I've
shown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you in the previous study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had an LED on this one that had far
red light, and then this one had green
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we achieved three target daily light
integrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically wanted to have a low DLI
and then increase that amount from 6 to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these lamps were on for 16 hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our various LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what they look like and
obviously what the microgreens look like
[SPEAKER_00]: under the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that when we have the green
and blue, you can actually see the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: color of the microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our spectral distribution for
the various treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, as you increase that intensity,
you see that the peaks also increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a little bit difficult for you
to see this from the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the one major difference that
you notice when you increase the daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I hear Bill basically said the answer
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you increase the amount of blue
light, we actually noticed this on
[SPEAKER_00]: geraniums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think of a zonal geranium and the
zonal part.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we increased that amount of blue
light, we saw an increase in anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're basically in the 11% to 12%
range in terms of blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with an increased daily light
integral, whether you had far red or green
[SPEAKER_00]: light, you definitely see an increase in
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a kohlrabi, a species that doesn't
necessarily show the red pigmentation or
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, we're basically looking at those
microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that under a low daily light
integral, it doesn't really matter in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the light quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you would expect, they're much more
elongated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really depends on the market,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some individuals might want microgreens
that are a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that increased daily light integral,
we see that they're much more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we see that expression of
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were all done at one temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we're looking at the hypocotyl
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got basically our three light
quantities and our increasing daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral from 6 to 18 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we increase our daily light
integral, the hypocotyl length decreases
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light we provide them,
the smaller the leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that a good or a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in terms of microgreens,
what is it that we're ultimately trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that might not necessarily be a
good thing, where we have a decrease in
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we have percent dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, increasing light quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an increase in dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of light quantity, there are
really no differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we're looking at the relative
chlorophyll content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, some slight increases with
increased daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, this is, I think, one of the
nice things is we looked at total
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can definitely see that with that
increased light quantity, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a difference in the total
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for the kohlrabi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we would have looked at the other
species that definitely has a darker
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage, we probably would have seen more
dramatic of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at total phenolics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were virtually no differences
between those different light quantities
[SPEAKER_00]: and light qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this leads us to another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Garrett Owen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been working on this for about a
year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we typically tend
to notice when we go to production
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, especially in March and
April, is you see a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hanging baskets,
and then obviously, crops growing below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, penicetum rubrum, purple fountain
grass, is a very popular ornamental grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems, however, is that
because growers have such low light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, and then you put hanging baskets
above them, you're really reducing that
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so often, these grasses are actually
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not very purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a closer look, and this is purple
fountain grass, but you wouldn't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were just looking at it in a garden
center or in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, color is a key component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers obviously buy purple fountain
grass because it's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to add some color into their
landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as when we think of red leaf
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, when you go into a greenhouse
and they're not providing supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: light, their red leaf lettuce is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of color, obviously,
it's attributed to chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: carotenoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is purple fountain grass that's been
cut back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown in a greenhouse, in a glass
glazed greenhouse, during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can obviously see the increased
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned before, with the
addition of blue light, we've noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can increase anthocyanin production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there had been some work
that had showed this previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought of a new concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically called end of production
supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say a grower produces their
lettuce or their penicetum under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions they always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they light the crop at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say anywhere from one to two
weeks before they're going to ship that
[SPEAKER_00]: crop out, they can increase the color,
enhance the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought of a way of quantifying this
by using a portable meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a meter that's often used in the
food industry to measure color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is with the penicetum is we
started off with plugs that were grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely see how light and
color they are, not much purple
[SPEAKER_00]: pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that for about 55 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to create the daily light
integral that we would have during peak
[SPEAKER_00]: production, which would be March,
April, we had a daily light integral of
[SPEAKER_00]: about six moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the daily light integral that we
would find under those hanging baskets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then basically placed the plants under
end of production lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to show you the different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our daily light integral basically from
the sun was close to nine moles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the various treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a photoperiodic control,
which gave us about four micromoles of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had a treatment where we had 100%
red, a combination of 50, 50 red and blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, our 88, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had 100% blue at 25,
50, or 100 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our spectral quality for the
various treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we're looking at the lettuce
grown under the 50, 50 red and blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% blue LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have the penicetum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually see the LEDs and how
the lettuce looks quite dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll show you what it actually looked
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are basically using that
colorometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the L star, the A star,
and the B star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that in just a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the L star is a measure of
lightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you get closer to zero, whatever
that meter is measuring is more towards
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the number increases towards 100,
it's more white.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of what we were looking for was
more of this red-green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a positive A star told us the pigments
were obviously more red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of B star, whether there was
a tendency of the pigments turning more
[SPEAKER_00]: blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took measurements on day one,
basically, when those plants were placed
[SPEAKER_00]: under end of production lighting,
and then at three, five, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: 14, and 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what our plants look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was about three weeks before a
grower would typically ship out the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to a garden center or retail greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are our initial measurements in
terms of the L star, A star, and B star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is after seven days of end of
production lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, again, the L star is a measure of
lightness from white to black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our control, you can see, was about
31.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a decrease in that number when
we had a combination of both red and blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light, as well as when we provided 100
micromoles of blue light alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we light the crop for yet another week,
we see that, obviously, the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously much darker in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see, again, a decrease in that L
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the A star?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a negative means green.
[SPEAKER_00]: A positive means blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we go from the control to a 50-50
combination of red and blue or 100
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles of blue, we obviously see that
number is more positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, visually, we can see that,
but we wanted to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we add another week, we see that
that number definitely increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the longer we have those plants under
that end of production, red or blue or
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% blue, we definitely saw a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here, we're looking at the B
star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a change from yellow to blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, control was 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that that number has decreased,
so we're becoming more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as we increase the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a visual close-up of,
this is after 21 days of end of production
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, and we're looking at individual
leaf blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 50-50 combination or the 100
micromoles of blue, we definitely see that
[SPEAKER_00]: those blades have colored up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really interesting thing is,
if you were to pick up, let's say we had
[SPEAKER_00]: two leaf blades that were like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to pick this one up,
it would be green underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really only those leaves that are
receiving that higher intensity of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light are actually, the anthocyanins are
increasing in those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a close-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 14 weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely see the difference
in terms of the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at a cultivar of geranium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a really dark foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called black velvet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see that 100 micromoles
of blue light or a combination of just
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% red or a combination of red and blue
definitely increases the pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanted to look at lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, red leaf lettuce
growers often have a challenge under low
[SPEAKER_00]: light conditions of actually having it be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all red leaf lettuce
cultivars, but you would not know that
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were obviously grown under a
low DLI of six moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we looked similar treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's the L star.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely see after seven days,
that number has decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, with the lettuce, five days was
enough to get it to go from basically
[SPEAKER_00]: green to a nice dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our A star.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely see that number has
increased quite a bit, as well as our B
[SPEAKER_00]: star.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our penicetum, we found that
anywhere from seven to 14 days of end of
[SPEAKER_00]: production lighting, whether we provided a
combination of red or blue light or one
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% blue light at 100 micromoles was
effective at increasing the pigmentation
[SPEAKER_00]: change in color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the red leaf lettuce,
five to seven days was enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, using the same two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last study that I'm going to talk
about today is basically looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: so obviously here we're looking at the
photoperiodic response is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greenhouse industry typically uses
incandescent bulbs to induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can obviously classify a lot of our
greenhouse floriculture crops as day
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral, short day, as well as long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to schedule these crops for
specific market dates, we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical things that growers will use
is either night interruption, so they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically will turn on these lamps from,
let's say, 10 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: to interrupt the night, and basically the
plants perceive a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can use day extension lighting,
where at sunset they'll turn on the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for a specific amount of time to provide a
long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are various treatments that
growers can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a poinsettia crop,
so they're using black out cloth to
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously provide a short day to induce
the crop in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or here they're using day extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said before, incandescent bulbs
have been used for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They emit a relatively low amount of red
light and a high amount of far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously far red light is what's needed
in order to induce flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very electrically inefficient,
only about 6% efficiency, short lifespan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and obviously they're being phased out of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are growers going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our next alternative is the compact
fluorescent lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem with these lamps is they
emit a high amount of red light and a
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively low amount of far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: With certain species like wave petunias,
which have a high response in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: light for a long day response,
it's delayed basically under compact
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescent lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The life of CFLs is also reduced by the
number of times that they're turned on and
[SPEAKER_00]: off, which can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they contain mercury,
which has some serious disposal issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: High pressure sodium lamps can also be
used for photoperiodic lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them for cyclical lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, they're energy intensive,
they're expensive, and they emit heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: With LEDs, as I've showed you,
we have different light qualities that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a longer operating life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spectra can be tailored based on
whatever response we're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's, as I showed you before,
a photomorphogenic response or a
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodic response.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are commercially available LED
lamps that are now on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does an incandescent bulb cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a four pack, I think you could
probably get them for about $2.
[SPEAKER_00]: CFL, not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are about $50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the life, they can last
many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the estimate is about 50,000
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, growers, in order to get
them to switch over to these, that's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we looked at a wide
variety of both long day and short day
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to, well, I'm getting ahead
of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically had an automatic blackout
curtain system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a nine hour base photo period,
which was from the sun, which was from 8
[SPEAKER_00]: AM to 4 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we provided high pressure sodium,
or increased the daily light integral with
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium lamps, which gave us
about 70 micromoles at plant height.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a common greenhouse environment for
bedding plant production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing that we wanted to look
at were the responses under low daily
[SPEAKER_00]: light integral versus high daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used day extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a 10 hour photo period of 13 or
16 hours, where basically the lamps were
[SPEAKER_00]: on for either 1, 4, or 7 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first lamp basically contained red
light, white light, and far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lamp only contained red and
white, so no far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that we had been hearing
from growers, especially growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: South or on the West Coast, was that they
could use this red and white lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, they would have a flower in
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where growers in the North would say that
they could not use these lamps,
[SPEAKER_00]: only these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the one thing in terms of using
far red light that I obviously told you
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits in terms of flowering,
but what's one of the negative drawbacks
[SPEAKER_00]: of far red?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a bad word in the greenhouse
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our photoperiodic lighting we
were providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to provide two micromoles of
photoperiodic light, because that's what a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower would typically provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had to use a screen over
these lamps, because our system is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we only place plants
where they would receive two micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: and not directly underneath those lamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our pansy crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we achieved a daily light
integral of about 6 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have our LEDs that had red,
white, and far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a long day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under a 10 hour photoperiod,
you see that it took 61 days to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we provided a 16 hour photoperiod,
we reduced that by nearly three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to schedule this crop
in the flower, obviously providing long
[SPEAKER_00]: days is going to reduce that time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about under just red and white light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see that there's basically
no statistical difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under a low daily light integral,
even though we were providing long days,
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop was delayed by quite a bit
compared to when we used far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the negative drawback of using
that far red light is there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in stem elongation when we
compared those crops that were grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: red, white, far red versus just red and
white light alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our petunia crop, relatively low
daily light integral under 6 moles of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that as you increase your
photoperiod, there's a reduction in time
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's that negative drawback
in terms of that stem elongation because
[SPEAKER_00]: of that far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under just red and white light,
the crop, whether it was grown under a
[SPEAKER_00]: short day or a long day, flowered
basically at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we see the difference in height,
and there's definitely differences between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a Snapdragon, again, a delay under
short days and a delay when we use just
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a red and white light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this coming summer, we're going to do
the work where we're going to look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher daily light integral and see if our
hypothesis is that growers in the South
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the West Coast, one of the reasons
they can use these red and white LEDs is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're getting enough far red light
because they have such a high daily light
[SPEAKER_00]: integral versus in the North.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, those height differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, what we're looking at is a short
day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So marigolds are a short day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a facultative short day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that when we grow them under
short days, they flower faster than under
[SPEAKER_00]: long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, obviously, they will flower
under long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have a daily light integral of
about 8 moles, and here, 15 moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there's not a lot of
difference in terms of the short days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are going to look at this with long
day plants this coming summer when we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really achieve these high daily light
integrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the conclusions from this study
is that under low DLI, low intensity LEDs
[SPEAKER_00]: with far red light, obviously,
they increase stem elongation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they hasten time to flower for long
day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under low DLI, the LEDs that did not have
far red light, obviously, there was
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced stem elongation, but there was a
delay in time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of growers in the North,
they can use these LEDs in lieu of,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, a compact fluorescent or an
incandescent, and they can have market
[SPEAKER_00]: ready plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's very species dependent in
terms of the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'd like to thank the
following organizations, companies for
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously funding, as well as for plant
material, fertilizers, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I think we have some time
for some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the question was, are T5 lamps
being used in greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_03]: And were you asking basically for the
photoperiodic lighting or for what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in any commercial capacity,
because the only place I see them is for
[SPEAKER_03]: house plants and home gardening and stuff.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a greenhouse, when we want to
provide whether it's supplemental or
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodic lighting, we want to get as
much sunlight as possible, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with a fixture for like a T5,
that's a lot of fixture where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically blocking out a lot of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the reasons why we
don't see them in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do see them in the same road
chambers or for indoor production of house
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The LED fixtures you showed in the last
experiment looked like they were Edison
[SPEAKER_05]: based, designed for 120 volt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we move to a future where we get
away from the backward compatibility,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can make them more affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's there you have your power regulation
circuitry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need one per bulb.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you just forget about the backward
compatibility, you can then design your
[SPEAKER_05]: LEDs to be optimal for cost and other
properties as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LEDs that I showed in the last
experiment, they're basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement for incandescent or compact
fluorescent, where they're a screw-in type
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb where all of the others, and low
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're basically made to replace those
lamps where the other lamps that I showed
[SPEAKER_00]: you right now, there are some lamps on the
market in terms of the supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting that are called a high pressure
sodium replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still, I would say,
a few years where it's going to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: while longer to get those HPS replacements
with a high intensity LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you done any work with analyzing the
purchase cost of the LEDs versus the HPS
[SPEAKER_02]: that were fluorescents in the case of
chamber lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, have we done any cost
comparison in terms of using high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium versus the LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were part of the USDA SCR grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's someone at Purdue who's
actually doing that component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully within this year,
we will have all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more difficult than we first
anticipated in terms of getting the data,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's basically getting the data
from all of the researchers to then look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the cost and how long does the grower
have to have the LEDs and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: In your last study, it seemed like stem
elongation and flowering response in
[SPEAKER_01]: long-day plants were closely coupled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if there's any way to break
that connection, perhaps by cyclic
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting of some sort, so that you're
giving, as you remember, at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: theory says that if the last light the
plant sees in a day, then if it's red,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the stems will stay short.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's far red, then the stems will
become longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if that also influences
for the period response as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, in our studies,
we use day extension lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of responses would we get
with night interruption lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Eric Runkle at Michigan State,
he is focusing on the night interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically a night interruption is four
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do cyclical lighting, which
obviously you can reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time that you light the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has found that four-hour night
interruption lights are much more compact
[SPEAKER_00]: than under day extension, as you would
expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Philips, I think the term you use
is production module.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Philips, I guess, has come up with some
recipes of red, blue LEDs that they think
[SPEAKER_02]: work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are those generally useful for lighting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a wide variety of plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: To what extent will there need to be
optimization for different crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the first studies that we did,
we had the 100% red, the 85, 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the 70, 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the various plant species,
we found that 85, 15 was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: combination when you took everything into
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the work that they had done in the
Netherlands came out with the ADA-12,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I showed you a lot of the,
and so that was a good, should I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a good combination of both red
and blue light that they found when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were looking primarily at vegetables in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a good combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the more blue light you had,
the more expensive the picture could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the psychological effect of these
weird colors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very good study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can get back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is low intensity, so it really
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are in a growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been shown at various places.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're under LEDs, some people
actually get ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this is in the walk-in
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into the chamber,
and let's say you're in there for even a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute, you walk out, and everything you
see is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in there for more than 15 minutes,
I feel nauseous when I come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lot of people that say the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is definitely a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are more of a red and white,
and those don't really bother your eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly as much as when you have the blue
light alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or excuse me, red and blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the addition of the green light or
phosphorus coating on the LEDs definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: helps out a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to be doing more studies
with white light, and I think for humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's definitely going to be a better
thing in terms of those of us that get
[SPEAKER_00]: nauseous under them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe instead of recruiting in grad
school, you should go to the dance clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question from here on the
hardware.
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked a little bit earlier about how
much more flexibility you have in the
[SPEAKER_04]: geometry of the layouts so that it doesn't
block light and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kinds of things might we expect in
terms of the geometry of where the lights
[SPEAKER_04]: are placed so you get the right light
distribution and they're not in the way
[SPEAKER_04]: for other things you're trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one thing with the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think of a high pressure sodium versus
an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a high pressure sodium, we tend to have
more of the light spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: With more LEDs, it's very directional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the LEDs that are on the
market, you have to have them relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the drought in order to get a
uniform light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the newer, higher intensity ones
that are quoted as the HBS replacement,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting better because they're
concentrating more LEDs in an area this
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can place them higher and you're
getting an increased uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I tell growers when
they ask me about supplemental light is
[SPEAKER_00]: they say wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really interested in the
technology, but I tell them if I were you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they still want to go into LEDs,
I tell them to look at the various.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many LEDs on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of claims that are sometimes
a little outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just tell them to do studies on their
own and see which one best fits their
[SPEAKER_04]: particular situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the white LEDs in rolls
embedded in this clear silicone-like
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not very expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty bright, very flexible,
literally, but also in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: installation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that one of the hardware
implementations you think we might see for
[SPEAKER_04]: supplemental lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing you need to think about
with LEDs is that the life of the LED is
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a greenhouse, especially where
we're in the mountains, it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have an effect on how long those
LEDs are going to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the method of cooling is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a system like that, they can be
relatively cheap, but you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to replace them quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure what sort of intensity
you would actually receive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're also taking the 20%, 25% loss.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first LEDs that I showed,
we had basically a fan on them to cool
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some instances, those LEDs use more
energy than the high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the method of cooling definitely
affects the energy usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's thank our speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
