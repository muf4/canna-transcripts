[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we are going to talk about toxic
metals in the soil and their effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk about why I started to study
metals in the soil, how toxic metals get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil, proposed experiments and
preliminary results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have studied toxic metals in the soil
and water for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago I got a call from a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a patient who was poisoned with
arsenic in organic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me to analyze soil for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A doctor was surprised to learn that soil
contaminated so many years ago could be
[SPEAKER_00]: made toxic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This case and other cases which was
promoted to me to study soil was
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a common contamination in soil
include?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lead, chromium, arsenic, zinc,
copper, mercury, nickel, silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of reason soil pollutes this
toxic metal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a result of industrial
activities like mine tailing, cold
[SPEAKER_00]: dorming, accident spew.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time it can be agricultural
practice, fertilize and pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: application, animal waste, wastewater
irrigation, sewage, sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we talk about sewage, sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is sludge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludge is sewage from wastewater treatment
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is sludge used in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reason is because it's very rich
material, phosphorus, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: total carbon, organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Example, here soil from sludge site after
40 years application and typical
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture in New York state soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 40 years in the soil which was
applied sludge, six times higher available
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and look at the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter times higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total nitrogen higher, total carbon
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good for agriculture like
fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time it's practical way to
dispose of sludge but sludge have very bad
[SPEAKER_00]: news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludge have very high concentration toxic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How government have deal with sludge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to early 97 there was no regulated
sludge disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1972 Congress direct the EPA to
regulate disposal in the sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: With only 1993 the EPA published
regulation of disposal of sludge,
[SPEAKER_00]: also known as Par-Pi-3, sludge of the
roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we talk about my study about sludge,
it was 1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we have to be concerned about present
toxic metal in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Accumulate in the soil is harmful for
human and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxic metal negatively affects soil health
and biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact the quality of produce grown in
its contaminated land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be cause chronicle problems in food
chain, blood, mitralogy, image,
[SPEAKER_00]: cardio, affect kidney, liver,
osteoporosis, the disease of the bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: arsenic, skin cancer, affect kidney,
central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't be concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metals remain in the soil long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expensive clean up of the soil
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use sludge as fertilizer make land less
suitable for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My study object is determine toxic metal
concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand how toxic metal I dissolve over
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evaluate toxic metal effect on the land
and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My study site is located in the Karnel
orchard, Gross Turb 66.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hole was contaminated 1978 with
sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sludge was dumped, one of the few
small sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1979 and 1985 the hill was flowed 20
centimeter deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: After 1995, crops no were grown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same field, maybe 10 yards away
from this spot where there was sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I brought in the lab, this is two
soil from one field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control soil has pH five, organic matter
3.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludge soil, pH around seven, organic
matter seven, two times higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see physical difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between sludge soil and the same field,
regular soil, where there was not applied
[SPEAKER_00]: sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I decided what is the sludge has,
they have toxic metal until today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is toxic metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sludge has toxic metal,
this is toxic metal mobile or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of plants are grown there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's impact for plant, the toxic metal in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, I propose study, the first goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's concentration of trace elements,
pH, salinity, texture, soil and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sequential extraction of the samples to
estimate amount metals, exchangeable plus
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble carbonate bond, strongly absorbed
residue metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: After, I would like to know leaching,
speed leaching of trace element because
[SPEAKER_00]: leaching is one of the methods recovery
soil from toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: My second goal is to analyze sludge soil
to measure soil health, microbial activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and productivity for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, I did total nitrogen,
mineral nitrogen, ammonium nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: active carbon, texture, organic matter,
soil respiration, biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: My third goal, to analyze of plants to
have invaded to contaminated site,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparative control site.
[SPEAKER_00]: To study, we look species plants in the
groin of the metal contamination area and
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plants adapt to toxic metals in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my result, total concentration of
metal in the sludge 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the sludge soil in the brown soil
in the greens, control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the yellow square, it's total
concentration metal in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see, look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon is very high in the sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, 700 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the nickels, 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper, 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let 155, but let it's a little bit
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you saw before the sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we have metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we see metal behavior in the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's maybe so safe and it's already passed
40 years and we can be, don't worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, I did sequential
extraction test to determine metal
[SPEAKER_00]: specification in sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this purpose, the first step I use
water, page seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second step was my defined organ,
page 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step three, melec three, page 2.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last step was acid digestion to
know residue metals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go look at the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Result for cadmium and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the here, cadmium in brown,
zinc in the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the, this is control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sludge soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data in the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see, control soil and sludge
soil, cadmium and zinc behave the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means, cadmium and zinc don't depend on
pH or modified organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it's very easy to move element to
using the metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can say dangerous element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go look at the copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The copper, control soil in the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludge soil in the brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the here, copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sludge soil, we have different
compare with control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the step two and step three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melec modified organ, pH 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melec three, pH two, 2.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see the more aggressive solution,
solution more break carbon bonds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more copper release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here organic metal all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's enough modified organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slide acidity solution to break
organic carbon bond and almost all copper
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go look at the result of the nickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control soil in purple, sludge soil in the
blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nickel around 50 ppm, I remind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction nickel in the soil,
it's a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mean nickel more connected with
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particular iron and manganese oxides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It behaves the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go result for lead for control soil
and sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Control soil in green, sludge soil in the
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sludge soil have high level organic metal
and high pH above 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see lead more aggressive solution,
but lead stay in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like a control soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mean organic metal and high
concentration phosphorus make lead
[SPEAKER_00]: insoluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the control soil,
what are the low phosphorus and very low
[SPEAKER_00]: organic metal lead release each one in the
second step, modified organ.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I decided, my question, between
available metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available metals, it's extraction water
plus modified organ plus mellic three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And available metals plus resduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resduce, it's the last after sequential
extraction, which is the soil left high
[SPEAKER_00]: deep digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's show which is kind of metal more
valuable, more mobile, more dangerous for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most mobile, it's cadmium and zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particular cadmium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means cadmium is the more dangerous
metals from all toxic metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's too heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I decided to estimate metal loses
from surface soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I calculate, I imitate in the lab
leaching of metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I calculate present leaching in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc in the soil 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the leaching only 0.2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many years will take it to remove zinc
from soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cadmium 0.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we talk about, cadmium a little bit
more faster than zinc, but the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go sum up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proposed study will be examined the
state dynamic and effect of the toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much soil 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My knowledge of this study would be the
first time to investigate this subject
[SPEAKER_00]: using modern analytical technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study will help understand how toxic
metals are dissolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If contaminated soil may be effectively
used for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I calculate like example zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 ppm is 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took bowl, special bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measure how many water.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I cover to keep this soil seven days
in this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after vacuum pump, I suck this water
and I'm running.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was the filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thinking paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soil water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not from filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water coming from special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like special cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have access to vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was larger than 1.5.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But filter doesn't touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is connection with pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was filter just not so put some hole
was in the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just covers the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the water can be very.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know that that is all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not only soil over the top,
but also it's probably down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were your solutions clear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they muddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear like green water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit not foggy, but it's not
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see, there may be some organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ICP was very nice and standard and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to work in the orchards and I'd
like to know what is the site that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you go to the orchard store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to this down, almost the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here different plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not growing grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing only big plants,
which is the plants root, maybe sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: three, five meters deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can see it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere one plant, it's like spas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to sign yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn into carnel and sign yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going from 266.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here sign yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn left, but it's almost across the
sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after 266, you're going to the vet
school and here orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit come downhill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know why the control soil had such
high lead concentrations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the source of the lead in the
control soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, what we talk about in my story,
in this story, 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And orchard was spray arsenic lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is lead coming from, because it
was orchard, 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is in my story was, because the
guy bought lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he bought lead from another guy,
and another guy, and another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 50s, there was orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchard spray arsenic lead from fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't know about this story,
and he started to grow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whole hospital in New Jersey was in
the people poisoned with mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was recent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
