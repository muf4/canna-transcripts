[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, we've got a couple of
Cornell folks, a bunch of Cornell folks
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle Wikings, our soil insect ecologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle will talk to us in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is May, so we're going to get into
this, but I want to say this is the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: mashup show, Carl, for the podcast
listeners and the people who watch the
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you see here, we are going to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to get an hour's worth of
information into 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to play this on half
speed to be able to keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we'll start with a good dog
picture, Miranda Robinson and Dakota,
[SPEAKER_00]: who made quite a splash at the Mitsubishi
Electric Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a Champions Tour event over at
TPC Sugarloaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like that dog was playing around
with everybody, walking around,
[SPEAKER_00]: had a pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love when the dogs get profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, M.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey putting barley to work, cutting
cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut 18 the other day for the turf grass
class.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is out in Seven Canyons in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking a lot about automation
a lot, and we're going to touch it,
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it or not, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put you on the spot a little
bit to ask you to speculate, but we start
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing to see every time you look up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week, the LPGA is playing out in
Ivins, Utah, the outside of St. George's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all mowed by these automated
mowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Black Desert Classic down
there in the high desert of southern Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the left, something simple that,
again, I would have appreciated this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: not having to cut 18 cups, is getting a
Dewalt drill on this automated cup cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle, you got to look into this for grub
sampling, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of all the years you've broken your
back just trying to break into this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like it's mounted on a skateboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a nice metal pallet because you
just turn the drill on, and you push it
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, above normal temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a warm week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places, almost 12 degrees above
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the season moved along quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are coming along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the New York metro area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting close to a lot of your soil
fungicide drenches for soil pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting near that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at that at Philly and likely near
that in the New York metropolitan area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, with that, we're starting to see the
real first spike where we're seeing some
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you, how are the plots going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times have you mowed so far this
year?
[SPEAKER_02]: We just put the first mow on tall fescue.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tall fescue is slower to green up and
to start growing than the adjacent mow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't perennial ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ryegrass has been probably for a week
and a half now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ready and going, but the tall fescue
lags behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: This model probably reflects more the tall
fescue growth, sort of slow, maybe even
[SPEAKER_02]: bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the ryegrass is probably in that
moderate, getting close to high right
[SPEAKER_02]: about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we like ryegrass for high
traffic areas in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what you want this time of
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little drier along the
southern coast down in Delmarva,
[SPEAKER_00]: Philly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There certainly had a deficit the last
week, but that's going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's going to get a little
bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get quite a bit of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up on the dollar spot risk
estimate going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting little blip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waiting for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all this moisture in the system
now and you're just waiting for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: warm weather to kick it from pink snow
mold into dollar spot world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good time to start to
see if you can wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this model click in and say go now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, Carl, you can save sprays by
holding off that first spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's going to be cool and
wet moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to maybe grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some pressure, but it is
something to consider when you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts on this, Carl?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the forecasting element is really
interesting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see this increase in the slope of the
line, whether it's our model or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Smith-Kerns, and that's related to
outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see that slope go up and then three
days out, four days out, it's cooling off
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's coming back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I go, maybe we can be a
little bit- That's not what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: here though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing that seven-day average.
[SPEAKER_02]: That green line is steadily growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that and I go, probably not time to
risk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, you've got the high value
turf you want to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we use these a lot of times for the
large area applications, your fairways and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weed control time and you can see the
ideal conditions are starting to build
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a few days from now in May 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see up the Hudson Valley and
certainly most of south of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania border with New York is good
to go on controlling these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see the pollinators risk
go up as well, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the setup for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that time of year where the lawn is
naturally flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a guy, our pollinator expert
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do a quick hit on the no-mo-may
since it's May 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about this a couple of years
now, Frank, but the idea is that we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to promote a beneficial habitat with this
no-mo-may, let the grass grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: let everything flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked the AIIUs, hey, draw me a picture
of what the public perceives are the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits of no-mo-may versus a traditional
lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those not watching, we got the
flowers, sunflowers, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in there, butterflies, bees on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's earthworms, there's a bunch of
stuff in the soil too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the traditional yard, there's a couple
ants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ants and worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle, you've done some research on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody thinks about the above-ground
insects, the butterflies and the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators, but you've looked at the
below-ground soil biota.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's running around in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you've looked at plots like a
no-mo-may plot and a traditional yard,
[SPEAKER_02]: is this the kind of thing you see or do
you see something different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it's the exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we're looking at a traditional
yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yards we're looking at are really
meant to be similar to a larger upstate
[SPEAKER_01]: New York lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: An acre or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, there's no inputs going into
the research plots we're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: other than mowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at everything from weekly
mowing all the way to an annual mow that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in fall, including no-mo-may as
one of our treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But comparing a weekly versus no-mo-may,
they don't really look like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Below-ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more smaller critters that
aren't shown on here that we're focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on like springtails, mites, and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Below-ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the focus, right, Carl,
is on the pollinators above-ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comments on that, Kyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover this a little bit,
but I want to get your two cents on not
[SPEAKER_00]: mowing for the month as a way of servicing
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got data, flowering data,
presence-absence of flowering pre-post
[SPEAKER_01]: mowing, and we've also got some data on
flower density five times throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: season for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do get a sense of a spike in May
when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens after that is some of
those no-mo-may plots end up having less
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering than all the other treatments
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some backfiring going on in the
plan, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some evidence that by not
mowing for a little while, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just probably a disturbance of
the canopy stuff as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to make it a habitat as well as
just a place where they feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the above-ground stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do see it show up in the flowering
presence that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see it also if you mow every two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not necessarily just a full month
of holding off on mowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's really what happens after
that for the remaining months where
[SPEAKER_01]: no-mo-may starts to look kind of raggedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look raggedy also by not flowering and
continually flowering throughout the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we think about pollinators,
we think about that consistency of feed
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the season, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the idea when this came
about, no-mo-may in Europe, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, this is a window of time when you
need to provide those pollen resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's necessarily the month
you would need it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't necessarily need flowers later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need it to line up with when
pollinators need those resources coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of overwintering and spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just seems so site-specific
depending on what flowering plants you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, it's like bindweed and a whole
bunch of other problematic things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of this is the social
aspect of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This sort of touches on your sort of view
of the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will consider it ethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will judge other people who
don't cut their grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole lot of sociological things
that I'm sure if I went anywhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, you could stir it right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to with this particular
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tool that I passed over about this
really just follows a couple of the common
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering weeds in the lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is something you tend to
think about more in the spring because we
[SPEAKER_00]: apply so many things in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We apply our pre-emergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply your early grub control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply your fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply your broadleaf weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on a lawn, you're potentially
making four applications of products at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time when the lawn will be likely
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that creates an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue is with rainfall coming,
man, the dumps with the heat feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting dumped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our runoff model looking at the
next bunch of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely a window in there
from the fourth to the seventh where you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really want to be applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And statewide on the sixth, except for the
northern reaches of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This puts us to let me look at my
calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This puts us into Tuesday, you know,
Monday, Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really, you know, you're starting your
week as a landscaping crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be very careful if you're
going out there in these regions where the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff risk is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember, this is a model,
right, Carl?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly wrong, but sometimes useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how would you internalize this if you
had a spray on this day in the areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: it was red?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: High slope areas near water bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we see red consistently for several
days and when you look at just a weather
[SPEAKER_02]: forecast on weather.com or whatever,
man, it's not going to be good to spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to lose not only that running
off into water bodies and causing water
[SPEAKER_02]: quality issues, but just effectiveness of
the spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're going to go out and treat
for a couple of days, you're going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and you're going to leave the
product where it's supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Monday is my spray day, I've got to
spray on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle, from your perspective, with maybe
the first ABW adult treatment we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get into here a little bit,
what would your thoughts be on,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I see peak adult activity,
but it's going to rain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I put that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that is exactly what we're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: with, I've put off an adulticide
application for a trial twice now because
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're just playing leapfrog in
between rain showers and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those adulticides, they've got to stay dry
for like at least 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't find a 12 hour window,
uh, you could be washing it off where it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's exactly what we're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to a number of
superintendents who are like, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I should wait longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're already delaying it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a little bit later is
better than a little bit early with these
[SPEAKER_01]: adulticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do them, but trying to
be surgical with them is so much harder
[SPEAKER_01]: when you've got chance of rain throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even expecting this and that,
and that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Kyle, here's the first quick hit for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came up the other day when we were
out at Delhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, somebody said, Hey, can I use my
Roomba mower or my autonomous mower to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with earthworm castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: What say you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen them drive over earthworm
casts before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they mow 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they basically say, what did he
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl, uh, 12 on no, no 16 on eight off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I'm, I'm curious about the,
the mechanism of the blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a razor blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not smashing like a real mower where
you're sort of getting the castings in
[SPEAKER_02]: between the reel and the bed knife.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a razor blade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we looked at the fairway over
there at Delhi, we don't see the smearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you get with the real mower on the
fairways and sort of, and Steve Kurt at
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuscarora was like, man, that,
that might be something useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I tell you, Carl, nobody's,
I'm sure somebody started this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be Steve and a bunch of us
standing out at Delhi coming up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, but I gotta tell you to a certain
extent, I'm, I'm just, I just want put a
[SPEAKER_00]: little brush, put like four or five little
things just to go to, to, to all you gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: do is knock it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think there was consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the blades will aware quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're hitting, I mean, these things
are really like old, you got to be old
[SPEAKER_00]: time to remember the old Wilkinson double
edged razor blades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That our fathers and grandfathers probably
shaved with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these things cut the grass
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kyle, here's our, that's our research
idea for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start, we'll start laying it out
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we have plenty of areas that have
worms and these are like related.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have them on every
fairway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have them on the fairways that,
uh, where you have these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we on the progress of preventing
this vertebrate damage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I let's, you know, everybody's talking to
me about grubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, every place I cut in,
even if it's not peeled back, I see a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: insect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know there's grubs everywhere,
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my sense is there's just grubs
everywhere that pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the populations have been pretty
good, but I don't have any trouble with
[SPEAKER_00]: those little buggers until these guys come
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we at with solving this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we thinking about playing Led Zeppelin
stairway to heaven?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was suggested many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we still want to try that,
but everything we've tried so far with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the skunks and raccoons just haven't
played ball with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, uh, don't show up for the concert
and they go elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's been the problem,
but yeah, trying to use something like
[SPEAKER_01]: soil vibration sound itself, or some kind
of a deterrent or mask on, on these
[SPEAKER_01]: populations of white grubs has been what
we've been trying to get at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, getting a captive population
that wants to behave and, and take part in
[SPEAKER_01]: your trial has been the main issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's like human subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you got to go through a whole
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you got to treat the
animals right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're to ABW.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so Kyle, Kyle and I were talking a
little bit before he got on Frank about,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, when we look at the degree
day triggers or the phenological
[SPEAKER_02]: indicators for when is peak adult
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who, who maybe don't know
what we're talking about here,
[SPEAKER_02]: annual bluegrass weevil, sort of the
almost the best time to get them when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all sort of synchronous and their
population is when they come out of
[SPEAKER_02]: overwintering and adults are moving
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some move early, some move late,
but there's sort of a curve that looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like what I got here, sort of a sign curve
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some peak and usually we think
110, 120 grown degree days or half green,
[SPEAKER_02]: half golden for Cynthia is when they hit
that peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and when I looked at the data just
yesterday, Oh man, it's about going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: about 110 degree days here in Ithaca
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I see half green, half gold there in
the for Cynthia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I checked this morning on weevil
track, which is a conglomerate of a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of research, like researchers like Kyle
taken scouting data and Kyle just says,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's, it's stage one peak adult
activity in Corning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Kyle, all of these things are lining up
the degree days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the phenological, you see it out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so right now on paper, it looks like,
Hey, everything's just a standard,
[SPEAKER_02]: typical traditional year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're seeing out when,
when you guys are doing your sampling at a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety of courses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've mostly been looking up on
courses up along Lake Ontario and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Southern tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it did not look like this
originally, you know, things really
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't lining up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had degree days advancing, uh,
at a certain pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we couldn't find weevils that seemed
to be the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really didn't look like what you'd
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were well past 50, uh, degree days
closer to 90, and we were still struggling
[SPEAKER_01]: to find adult weevils on some courses that
we knew had problems with them last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, things just seemed out of sync.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to for Cynthia,
you know, we found so many for Cynthia
[SPEAKER_01]: this year that had some kind of freeze
damage on them that there's very light,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, canopy on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what flowering that had, it was really
hard to assess much of what was going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just found really raggedy looking for
Cynthia and the ones that were,
[SPEAKER_01]: had a better canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't find a lot of consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some that had green already,
some that, you know, full gold looked kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that didn't seem to line up that well
either, but I'd say starting tail end of
[SPEAKER_01]: last week, we last week is about when we
hit one 10 to one 20, like you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: here, Carl, for most of the courses we
work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we started to see adult
activities seem like it was sinking up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say we're kind of at that peak
activity window in the Finger Lakes now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked back through our records and that
same window happened the first week of May
[SPEAKER_01]: last year too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as messy as things seemed coming out of
winter, we didn't know what was going on
[SPEAKER_01]: and nothing seemed to be lining up,
but it seems like it's maybe behaving a
[SPEAKER_01]: little better now with adult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't we heard Andy Wilson, our palette
director of agronomy at Beth Page talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about after all the years of keeping data,
he's basically got it nailed down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: same week every year for his larval,
his first larval application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the next questions for
you, Kyle, is we sort of best management
[SPEAKER_02]: practices, sort of to do the, you know,
you've called it the three step program.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do an adult early cause you know,
that's when they're all coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, when, when you first sort of
do the scouting and see the larvae,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you hit them with a larva side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of the first two components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think that as you go, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to some extent, it's like what's
the point I'm tender to not be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the, the, the, the, the,
the, the, the, the, the larva side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to go for the, therimination
on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been used to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, you know, the,
the, the, the, the larvae, the larvae,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larvae, the larvae, the larvae just
started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot of, there's a whole
bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: very effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kyle, you've looked into a couple
different treatment programs the last few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, a couple of which have no
adulticide early and just a larvicide and
[SPEAKER_02]: then another one later in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're finding that works pretty well,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe contrary to what we used to think
about, hey, you got to get that adult,
[SPEAKER_02]: adulticide down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work we've been doing, like a lot of
other turf entomologists and actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of other entomologists in general has
been looking at the new active
[SPEAKER_01]: isocyclosurine serum, what's going to be
planazoline from Syngenta.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Planazoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the chemical name.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Planazoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about this during the state park
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just started advertising it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that the attempt there was to
try and break this up into sort of a two
[SPEAKER_01]: stage window where you're not so dependent
on just going after adult, adulticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, move away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know, we did try some later
stage larvicides only, just one
[SPEAKER_01]: application, and it can be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did find that even as surgical as we
were trying to be with scouting and timing
[SPEAKER_01]: of everything, like really intense
scouting, we still had a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: more damage show up with that one than we
saw if we did go in with some kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier larvicide as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got significant knockdown of the
weevils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it really, if you put all the
eggs in that later, stage larvicide
[SPEAKER_01]: basket, it definitely does require really
careful scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's certainly some courses that
are really successful at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the scouting aspect is one thing you'll
say and all the other entomologists will
[SPEAKER_02]: say is you got to scout at your golf
course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each golf course is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding how many adults when you're
doing the soap flushes means peak is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, that's different course by course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I think of courses like the
Cornell golf course here, Kyle,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got different types of
overwintering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sites, some meadow areas out in the middle
of the open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the woodland areas,
very shady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see superintendents who will do
scouting in these two areas and apply at
[SPEAKER_02]: different times and specifically out and
say, hey, I got to, you know, maybe on
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday I'm going to have to go out in the
meadow areas because it's warmer and then
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a week later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this a best practice that you're
recommending to folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that kind of a stagger before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it starts to sink up a little bit
over time, but a narrow but we've seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: stagger like that where we were finding
them way out in the rough on one green
[SPEAKER_01]: around one green and on another.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were much closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it always relates to
how close the overwintering site was
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily, but we do see that,
especially if there's one green that's
[SPEAKER_01]: much more shaded than another that's
exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, back to like these really
narrow windows of time when everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get their tank mixes together
and just make one shot in spring for these
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen anybody considering trying
to break up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying to pick the date that
would be best for all of the spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've seen most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're definitely considering that
variability that we're seeing on the I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, I only know a handful that actually
go out and vacuum sample or do soap
[SPEAKER_01]: flushes to try and gauge that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're aware that there's variability
in the development of the adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just saw a paper the other day,
Kyle, looking at comparing scouting
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and actually concluded,
surprisingly, that the soap flush was
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the vacuum method,
depending on the height of the grass that
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw in that particular paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to go back to I think,
you know, the soap flushing that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been using at that page for the last
decade or 15 years continues to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: easy beasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a two and a half gallon jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You squirt some lemon joy continues to be
the the surfactant soap of choice to
[SPEAKER_00]: irritate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Must be something in the lemon chemical
that's irritating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about the overwintering
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you played around with this in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, listen, when I was when I
heard Carl say this overwintering thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it reminded me, man, only the old guys are
going to know what I'm talking about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry Nemchek, the old Ohio state,
the late Ohio state entomologist used to
[SPEAKER_00]: used to recommend walking in the woods
with the granular insecticide to kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the overwintering sites with
Dersban.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were probably in Dersban back then or
Diazonon or some some chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's where we've come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were so desperate for a really long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Pat Vittum spent her entire career
studying this one organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like we're making it into and
Ben proclaimed last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not even worried about this no
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so I want to hear about the over the
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's revisit the little bit of work
you've played around with in and
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting or messing around with
potentially meadow areas or overwintering
[SPEAKER_00]: sites that then would affect damage and
population the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll just mention first,
Dan Peck did some good work showing how
[SPEAKER_01]: far on average into those natural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: ABW seems to overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a pretty good depth in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it tapers off quickly,
but it would be a really hard amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: space to actually cover effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially because you almost have to make
the assumption that they're just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: all along those natural areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just surgically pick the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention the whole non-target effect
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we played around with it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just really curious how the way we
manage, especially grassy natural areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we manage those might influence how
well the weevils overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found you can't really improve
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really get better overwinter
mortality of the weevils.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can make it worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make them overwinter more
successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way to do that is leave all the
residue in there, like mow it and leave it
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting or just leave it tall standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting that residue out of the natural
areas makes that a lot more inhospitable
[SPEAKER_01]: of a habitat for the weevils to overwinter
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how common that practice
is, but taking the residue off of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a lot more violent temperature
spikes that happen in winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call it a best practice,
because if you really are embracing those
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, you want them to be as thin and
wispy as possible if there's any chance
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So harvesting the plant material is the
simplest way of mining the soil for the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that you have no other way of
getting rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I obviously don't want them to
leach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, listen, I want to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got three minutes and Albrecht
published his paper last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle, and you were talking a little bit
about it with the State Park guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a chance to talk about
this sort of idea where you go out on your
[SPEAKER_00]: own golf course and you sample some soil
and you make a nematode brew that you then
[SPEAKER_00]: apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys have found you get
persistence for whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to leave this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be providing some control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed this sort of conglomerate image
from the publication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I've thought about a lot
following up from Nelson Shields work in
[SPEAKER_01]: field corn and wasn't doing it quite this
way where they were more bringing it back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the lab and trying to sell their own
nematodes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that you can take a
population on site, rear it up and reapply
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a really cool paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it shows that we know that most
of these golf courses have some degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: insect pathogenic nematode populations on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to harness that and
re-release them and back out is really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how they tried it in the fairways
and in the rough, too, because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: super different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cheap to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The materials that Albert's showing here
are pretty inexpensive to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a very different system to
be able to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We played around with this a little bit in
sod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found, depending on the soil type,
you can get the nematodes to persist
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well, even through sod harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some interesting science to
this that I think is a...
[SPEAKER_00]: This just jumped right out at me when you
said it, because for years we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about how almost all these properties have
to have some suppressive effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for this now in the dollar
spot world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ming Yi just published that paper recently
on the potential for soils to suppress
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that we could do this,
I think probably scares a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that might all of a sudden not be able to
do this, but then I'm sure to build an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry on how to do this automatically
at your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be something to do with all those
hollow time... See, I'm wondering,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do we got to take plugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I just... I got a quarter damn
thing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring up plugs, collect the soil from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that another way to go here,
Kyle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just soil is soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your plugs in and use that to...
Yeah, we grow grass from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generate putting greens from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can certainly collect those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that when we did some aerification
work and brought the plugs back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's certainly something you
can try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it is getting... If it's
going to be something that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: superintendents do versus a service
provide, like they'll collect rear and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you your nematodes back versus
something you can just run in your shop
[SPEAKER_01]: with a cheap cup of insect hosts and then
basically screen out a solution to spray
[SPEAKER_01]: back out would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess where it needs to go next is
testing that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different soil types
because we've seen so much variability in
[SPEAKER_01]: how well they'll persist and establish
based on soil type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee that's stuff Albrecht is
thinking about too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How it's going to work on each... Okay,
so as a last word, and then we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: out of here, is it pretty much the better
the soil, the more organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better balance of air and water,
the better nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worse compacted clay, dramatic
soils, the worst for nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you got a pretty good healthy
soil, quote unquote healthy soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes will persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we found that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils, they persisted best in our highest
organic matter soils, soils that you amend
[SPEAKER_01]: with sand, you get a little bit better
performance on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compacted soils, especially the work
that we did on school athletic fields and
[SPEAKER_01]: goal mouths doesn't work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the soil is compacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Carl, we made it, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got everything covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: The insect mashup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The insect mashup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
