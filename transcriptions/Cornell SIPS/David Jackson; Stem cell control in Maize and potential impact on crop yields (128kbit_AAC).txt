[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to be back at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I come here, which is not as
often as I'd like, I always wish I came
[SPEAKER_00]: more often because there's so many great
people here and so many friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will try and come more often,
but I think it's been about 10 years since
[SPEAKER_00]: I was last here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm going to talk about
development, which is what we study,
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to the work you know from
Mike's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm really fascinated by
this idea that genes control development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple idea, but, you know,
development is obviously a very complex
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of form of three-dimensional
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that we can tease this apart
by finding individual genes that control
[SPEAKER_00]: specific aspects of development is
something that I find very attractive
[SPEAKER_00]: because I want to know how things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I was a kid, I would be taking
toys apart and breaking them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and finding out how machines work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know how plants work and
specifically how the morphology is
[SPEAKER_00]: generated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, potentially we could use
that to improve crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe I'm very naive,
but, you know, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should always think about potential
applications for our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very much like Mike's lab, we study the
meristems, the shoot meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always sort of assume that everybody
knows what a meristem is, but I know most
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the meristem in maize,
which is what I'll talk about today,
[SPEAKER_00]: is found right at the base of the
seedling, not up here, which is where most
[SPEAKER_00]: people guess it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think it's here, but it's
actually right at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're very patient and dissect
away all of the leaf primordia down here,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're rewarded by this amazing
structure, the shoot meristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this dome of cells, stem cells,
that throughout the life of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: generate all the organs that are required
for growth and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a scanning EM because the
meristem is pretty tiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a tenth of a millimeter in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this structure obviously is critical
for plant development because it makes all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the structures of the shoot,
including the leaves, the axillary
[SPEAKER_00]: meristems, which make the inflorescences,
the ears, and also the tassel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a critical structure, and it's
something we can analyze and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: using genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, 25 years ago, when Mike and I
were in Berkeley, I remember Ian Sussex
[SPEAKER_00]: told me that the meristem was a black box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a killer project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put a postdoc on that because he
couldn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so mysterious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But although he wrote the book on
meristems, Steve's and Sussex,
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't use a lot of genetics in his
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he came before the era of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics is the key, really,
to understanding this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what you should also realize is the
meristem doesn't also make leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, after transition to
flowering, it produces the reproductive
[SPEAKER_00]: organs, reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are also shoot meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have the axillary shoot
meristems make the ear primordia that make
[SPEAKER_00]: the ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the apical shoot meristem produces the
terminal tassel that is similar in
[SPEAKER_00]: structure to the ears, except it has
branches, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tassel is branched in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are all meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all meristem structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can study genes that affect all of
these different stages of development,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we tend to focus on the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because that's why the phenotypes
that we work on them are dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look a lot at ear primordia and
these things that we affectionately call
[SPEAKER_00]: baby ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sometimes gets us in trouble with
FedEx when we ship packages labeled baby
[SPEAKER_00]: ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get some strange reactions from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're all familiar with the ear of
corn, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've eaten this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody loves it, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we look at the ears when they're about
this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is two millimeters by the thickness
of a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this stage, already, most of the
morphogenesis, the initiation of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: structures has occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the flanks of the apical meristem,
you have all these primordia forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called spikelet pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they form spikelets and then florets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what produces the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meristem of this very early stage
is already making this very regular rows
[SPEAKER_00]: of primordia that will make the regular
rows of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the morphology is set up very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there it is again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all scanning EMs,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are really easy to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just live tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it in this SEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two minutes later, we have it finished
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should play around with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've characterized a lot of the genes
that are involved in ear development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just give you an outline of some
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are a lot of different
things going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the inflorescence, there are leaves
that are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're actually suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their growth is suppressed to promote
growth of the meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a class of genes called tassel
sheep, which Clint Whipple is now focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cloned the first one of those in my
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he has his own group now working on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The axillary meristems are initiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of the genes involved in
that process are involved in oxycycline,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we know also from Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work from Paula McSteen and Andrea
Galavotti has worked a lot on these genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work and continue to work on genes that
impose determinacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really a branching,
a series of branching events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, three rounds of branching
produce florets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that indeterminacy has to be
turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So determinacy has to be imposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is characterized by a class of
genes called the ramosa genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working on those, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for today's seminar, because I know
it's lunchtime and everybody's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get hungry, I'm going to focus just on one
group of genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones involved in
maintaining the stem cells right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the very famous genes known
from Arabidopsis from the work of Elliot
[SPEAKER_00]: Meyerowitz and many other groups,
the colada genes and the wooshle genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I will focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've known for a really long time,
actually since the 1920s and before,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the meristem has some kind of program
for controlling its size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meristem is a structure of
proliferating cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cells are not proliferating out of
control, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very carefully controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mary Pilkington did these very nice
experiments in the 1920s, where she would
[SPEAKER_00]: remove all the leaf primordia from
meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is in beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bisect the meristem with a razor
blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each half will regrow,
regenerate, and produce new meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the same size as the original
meristem was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meristem has some kind of internal
program to control its size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know now from a lot of work,
mostly in Arabidopsis, actually almost
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively in Arabidopsis, that this
mechanism for controlling size is through
[SPEAKER_00]: this classical clavado-wooshle feedback
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work on that has told us that there
are two really important groups of cells
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the tip, you have the true
initials, stem cells, that we know from
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the true progenitor cells of the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below that, there's a group of
cells in purple here, which is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, to understand how the
meristem is maintained, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there's a crosstalk or a
feedback between these two groups of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organizing center sends a positive
signal to the stem cells to tell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: divide.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that you need to promote stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So differentiation to maintain the shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to maintain this as an ordered
structure, this has to be kept in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kept in balance by a negative
signal sent from the stem cells back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the organizing center.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so mechanistically, that's how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the genes involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the stem cells, you have the
clavado genes, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up to now, most of the work has been
done on a couple of loose-leaved receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: called clavado-1 and clavado-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ligand, which is a small
secreted peptide encoded by a gene called
[SPEAKER_00]: clavado-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene makes a pre-peptide of about
100 amino acids that's cleaved into a
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-mino acid signal that's secreted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it binds to clavado-1 and activates
signaling in this kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the organizing center is
characterized by this famous homi-domain
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission phytowushel, which is
expressed down here in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wushel promotes stem cell fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clavado genes repress stem cell fate.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know this is important because in
nature, in the wild, and in our gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see plants where we've lost this
negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call this stem cells out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: The botanical term for that is faciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, the stem cells
overproliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get these amazing convoluted
shoots or inflorescences, or flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomato, for example, work from Zach
Lippmann and Esther VandenAff has shown
[SPEAKER_00]: that a clavado is what gives rise to this
beefsteak tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to show this being a Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, this is a very famous picture
from Ithaca, 1929.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I just realized that this is the
same year that that Maristan bisection
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1929 was a good year for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this is Barbara McClintock,
who discovered transposons and later,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, went to Cold Spring Harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we study this in maize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I said, most of the
foundational work has been done in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabidopsis is a fast-cycling plant with a
small genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maize is a slow-cycling plant with a huge
genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I think we can find new things
in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the great things about maize is
we have a huge mutant collection that is
[SPEAKER_00]: generated in part by the scientists who
developed these transposon lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in maize, we have a lot of
clavado-type mutants, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of the work that I'm going to
tell you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't call these clavado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them fasciated ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fasciated, again, is the botanical term
for these massively expanded stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these mutants, and this is just five
I'm showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another 20 that we haven't
characterized yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought I would keep it focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these mutants, as you would
expect, we clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're orthologs of the clavado
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So TD1 is clavado-1, this LR receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fe2 is clavado-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then others that we've cloned have
been different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have found new things in maize that
were not discovered in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fe3 is a new type of LR receptor that
functions somehow in the clavado feedback,
[SPEAKER_00]: but was not characterized in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does function in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fe4 is a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit about CT2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a G protein that we think is
involved in signaling downstream of these
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a large collection of mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really great material to work
with to discover the genes that control
[SPEAKER_00]: this Maristan feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I'll talk about today,
and this is more recent work, is the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that these genes may be useful for
controlling yield rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in maize, breeders measure yield
traits, such as obviously total mass of
[SPEAKER_00]: corn that's harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also use more quantitative
traits, such as this one kernel row
[SPEAKER_00]: number, which is the number of kernel rows
around the circumference of the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you break the ear in half,
you can just count these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one has 12 rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, if you count quickly,
has 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have this idea that by controlling
size of the Maristan, you could control
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you see, this is now looking down
from the top of the ear, ear primordium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the apical Maristan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of these primordia are the
ones that are making the rows of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So naively, you could say, well,
if we can make this Maristan bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we could make more rows of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing that's really
interesting about kernel row number,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, is that maize itself is a
man-made crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's genetically modified by humans over
the past 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's derived, as you know,
work from John Doebley and Ed Buckler and
[SPEAKER_00]: others has shown that maize is derived
from Tiacinte, which had only a single row
[SPEAKER_00]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And human selection over the course of
thousands of years gave rise to the
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing year of corn that we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this is genetic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So kernel row number is acute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a QTL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's heritable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can map loci that control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know this was a gradual
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primitive crops of maize found in
high-altitude caves in Mexico look like
[SPEAKER_00]: this or this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have eight rows or 12 rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, more modern varieties that
we eat or cows eat have 18, 20 rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a trade that was gradually
selected over the course of the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mutants may have something to do
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our faciated mutants have a lot more
rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the rows are really
disorganized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yield of these mutants is very
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a farmer would never want to grow
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, they make too many
primordia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meristems are proliferating,
proliferating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, it's making hundreds of
primordia appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of them are productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just abort because there's too many
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're fighting for resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to try and control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the model, our sort of thinking is like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we knock out one of these faciated
genes completely, so zero activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a massive overproliferation,
high kernel rows, but very low yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we could make an allele of a gene
like this that had reduced activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hypermorphic allele, maybe we could
make the meristem a little bit bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still organized, and make more
rows of seeds around this bigger meristem,
[SPEAKER_00]: and somehow optimize a yield of at least
kernel row number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we'll get to towards the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call this like the Goldilocks
principle or the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too hot or too cold is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to be right in the middle and
have the right temperature or right level
[SPEAKER_00]: of gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I want to go through one example of
a mutant we've cloned just to give you an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of the process we go through in
finding the genes and characterizing these
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mutant is called Compact Plan II.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gets confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This should be called faciated ear or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this mutant was discovered in the
1960s before I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't get to name this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect old mage nemesis,
so I don't want to change the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep this name Compact Plan II.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as its name suggests, the mutants are
very compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dwarfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't care about that so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I care about is they have faciated
ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the phenotype that I'm really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we clone this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was probably three years of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like most people, I just show it in a
single slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that it encodes a protein
called G alpha, which is the alpha subunit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the heterotrimary G protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genes are super famous in
mammalian systems because G alpha is a
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a GTPase that interacts with a class
of receptors that are called, not
[SPEAKER_00]: surprisingly, GPCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which stands for G protein coupled
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GPCRs in yeast and in humans are these
seven pass transmembrane proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are targets for about half of
all pharmaceutical drugs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: developed for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very important in the
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So G alpha is the signaling protein that
when these receptors are activated,
[SPEAKER_00]: this protein is a GTPase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be activated by transferring GDP
to GTP, becomes activated, dissociates
[SPEAKER_00]: from its subunits later in gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those dissociated subunits go away and
start signaling cascades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because these proteins were so famous
in mammalian systems, people started
[SPEAKER_00]: working on them in aerobidopsis and made
mutants in them and found that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, anybody who screened them
for a phenotype would find their favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were looking on cell proliferation
or different hormones or sugar signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: or defense responses, people found a lot
of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was nothing specifically up to
now to do with meristems or development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought we had a unique angle here
because we'd shown that this mutant in G
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha had a very clear meristem-sized
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we do, or what we do all
along with these mutants, is we try to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the genes into pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that by epistasis analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we make double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we made a double mutant between
our CT2R G alpha mutant and Fe2,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, if you remember, is one of the
clavado receptors, one of these feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cell receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that the double mutants,
and here we're measuring, we did this by
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring meristem size, but we can also
do it in a more easy way by counting spike
[SPEAKER_00]: of density in the tassels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that double mutants look like the
single mutants in terms of spike of
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what we would call
epistasis and suggest they're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we did something that serves as a
control experiment, a double mutant with
[SPEAKER_00]: TD1, which is a different Mase clavado
receptor, Mase clavado one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see an additive phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that CT2 and TD1 are in
different pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually in parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we had epistasis with Fe2
suggesting these proteins may be acting
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to look further at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made a GFP or YFP fusion of CT2
and fused it in frame with the native
[SPEAKER_00]: promoter with the CT2 coding region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could image it and it's on the
membrane, which is what is predicted from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the work in mammals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, as we hoped and expected,
we saw high expression in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is expressed in the meristem and has
some interesting patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have time to go through
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these reporters, as Mike said,
can be very useful for just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: where things are expressed, but they're
also really useful for more functional
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had a hypothesis that CT2 might
interact with this clavado receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using the GFP as a tag, we could use
that for IP experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: immunoprecipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we pulled down CT2 with a GFP
antibody in an immunoprecipitation
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already had an antibody to detect
Fe2 that's shown here, the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: antibody that detects this Fe2 receptor in
the membrane fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we showed that if we IP CT2,
we pull down Fe2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling down the G protein also pulls
down the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did controls with a different
membrane protein, because these membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: IPs are actually very tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get a lot of background,
but we did a different membrane protein in
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we IP that one, we don't pull down
the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think it's specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our model now is that this G protein is
signaling from the clavado receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Fe2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's true, we should be able to
see some other kind of clavado phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: in our mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we saw it has big meristems,
but you can get big meristems for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see if it's really in the clavado
pathway, there's a really neat assay,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, first developed in neurobiopsis,
where you can actually synthesize clavado
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, clavado 3 is the ligand for
these receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 12 amino acid peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just ask GenScript to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a week later, you have the peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add that to plants, it will inhibit
meristem proliferation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mutants in these genes, the meristems
over proliferate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you add back the peptide in excess,
you get the negative phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the opposite phenotype,
which is you suppress meristem growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we do these experiments with
embryos, because in maize embryos,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're big enough that we can dissect
them and culture them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the meristem is exposed, so we can
easily access them with a peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we culture the embryos on media with
clavado 3 or a control with a scrambled
[SPEAKER_00]: peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same sequence, but just the
order of the amino acids is scrambled,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it shouldn't have any effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, we find that with a
scrambled peptide, we don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the mutant and the wild
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we treat these with clavado 3,
the wild type meristems, their growth is
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibited, as we predicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G alpha mutant, CT2, they're also
inhibited, but much less than the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say they're partially insensitive to
this peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to us, this says that CT2 is somehow
involved in transmitting this signal from
[SPEAKER_00]: the peptide to the meristem proliferation
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so to summarize this part,
what we think is happening now is that in
[SPEAKER_00]: animals and in yeast, this heterotrimeric
G protein complex interacts with these
[SPEAKER_00]: seven pass receptors, the GPCRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in plants, it seems to be very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are GPCRs in plants, or at least
proteins predicted to be GPCRs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they haven't been convincingly shown
to interact with G alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found that G alpha interacts with a
clavado receptor, FAT2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we published that a few years ago,
and I was kind of nervous about publishing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's so dramatically different
between animals and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, there have been several
other papers showing that, indeed,
[SPEAKER_00]: G proteins do interact with LRR receptors
in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is both in development and also in
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we wanted to look at, is this just
an effect of G alpha, or is this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: heterotrimeric complex involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, it's a three-protein
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's G alpha, G beta, and G gamma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually went after G beta next for
the obvious reason that it's a single-copy
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mutants should have a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other reason was that work in
Arabidopsis published very soon after our
[SPEAKER_00]: work in Mays actually showed that in
Arabidopsis, G beta controls meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had G alpha controlling meristem
size in our mutants in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So G beta mutants in Arabidopsis have big
meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group in Japan found that G beta
interacts with RPK2, which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: classic clavado receptor, but it's a
clavado-related receptor that also
[SPEAKER_00]: functions in the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems there's precedent that these G
proteins, probably the whole complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: is functioning in meristem control.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this was our first CRISPR
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this with Dinyang at Iowa State,
and we were super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, we're going to get these
plants back, and they'll have big
[SPEAKER_00]: meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got them, and we were very
disappointed that they were dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for development biologists,
this is not a very satisfying phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, well, we could recover these
because we got events back that were
[SPEAKER_00]: heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we self them, the homozygous G
beta mutants, they germinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then within three days, they're just
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in stark contrast to Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I told you, the Arabidopsis
mutants have big meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants themselves look pretty
normal, so we were really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked a little bit more closely at
this, and what we realized is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants were not just arresting,
but they were actually becoming very
[SPEAKER_00]: necrotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that cells were dying,
the tissue was turning brown very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did some assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for hydrogen peroxide and for cell
viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quickly realized that, yeah,
these mutants were actually undergoing
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of autoimmune response where
they're actually killing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also had looked at
pathogenesis-related gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think this is some kind of
autoimmune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of, well, it makes sense based
on what I'll tell you next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we also grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew the seedlings or the seeds under
sterile conditions, and they still die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a pathogen thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just killing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this sort of makes sense based on what,
in Arabidopsis, groups have looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: G protein mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arabidopsis and G beta mutants actually
are more susceptible to various pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is inoculation of wild type
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the AGB1, the Arabidopsis G beta
mutants, are much more susceptible to a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that, as I alluded to earlier,
these G proteins are probably involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling from defense receptors as well
as from the clavada development receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, a really nice story came out
last year from Jaming Joe's group actually
[SPEAKER_00]: showed that G beta interacts with FLS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So FLS2 is an immune receptor in
Arabidopsis that's involved in the innate
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And G beta interacts with FLS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that explains the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually seems to function as a
positive regulator of immunity through its
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction with FLS2, but also by
stabilizing a diasterein kinase of FLS2
[SPEAKER_00]: called B1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So G beta functions in immunity in
Arabidopsis, and the mutants are more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this really still doesn't explain why
our maize mutants are much more severe,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our maize mutants are not more
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just dead even in the absence of
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we figure this out by thinking about
how, again, how immunity signaling works
[SPEAKER_00]: in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're probably all much more familiar
with this than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you know, plants are constantly
bombarded by pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pathogens secrete effectors into the
plant cell that try to suppress the
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular immune signaling pathways or
defense pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of a viable infection
where there's no resistance, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is susceptible and will be affected
by the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now plants have evolved these R proteins,
resistance proteins, that can either
[SPEAKER_00]: interact directly with the bacterial
effectors, the pathogen effector,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more frequently it's thought that
these R proteins interact with another
[SPEAKER_00]: host protein, another plant protein that
is targeted by the effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually guarding or surveying
that host protein to see if it's under
[SPEAKER_00]: attack by a pathogen effector,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called the guard hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plant proteins that are bound by
the R proteins are called guardies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being guarded so that when the
plant is under attack by an effector,
[SPEAKER_00]: it knows it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's known that if you mutate these
guardies, then the plant, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinks it's being attacked and you get an
autoimmune phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we think is happening with
G beta, that we think G beta is guarded by
[SPEAKER_00]: an R protein or an R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we mutated, the plant think it's
being attacked by pathogens and it kills
[SPEAKER_00]: basically every cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can test that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to test that is that R genes are
very polymorphic between different
[SPEAKER_00]: ecotides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took our G beta mutant as a
head, obviously we can't cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: homozygous, but we crossed the head to all
of the NAM maze diversity lines and made
[SPEAKER_00]: F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that for most of them,
we still got the same phenotype that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants were lethal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a few lines where now the
phenotype is suppressed and we get plants
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not completely wild type,
but they're not dead, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow, they make inferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think these suppressors are lines,
eotypes that no longer contain the R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, we've mapped one of these and
it maps in a region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know the exact gene yet,
but it maps in a region where there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted R gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a bit of an aside for us,
but it could actually get us to a new R
[SPEAKER_00]: gene in maze, which would be cool because
actually very few R genes have been cloned
[SPEAKER_00]: in maze up to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but anyway, we were excited to have
these plans because now we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is now the developmental phenotype of
G beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually looks very similar to G
alpha, the CT2 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've suppressed the defense responses
and they have, so we call these G beta
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have big meristems and we think this
is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually coming back to the concept I
brought up earlier, G beta in maze in GWAS
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis associates with kernel row
number, the trait that I mentioned that we
[SPEAKER_00]: think is associated with meristem size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still working on this,
but we think, at least up to now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we think that G beta is also functioning
in meristem signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now we have a situation where
PHA2, this Clavada receptor, is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling through G alpha and G beta.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably G gamma also, but we haven't
done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's work in the rapidopsis that
the morpholog of PHA2, which is Clavada2,
[SPEAKER_00]: signals through a different protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that protein is called Carinae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carinae is a, well, when it was first
cloned, it was published to be a kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's actually a pseudo kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a protein that has homologous
kinases, but has no kinase activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably acting as some kind of scaffold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always interested in this question
about how meristems evolve and whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: same pathways are present.
[SPEAKER_00]: In maize, or I say in monocots and in
dicots, or whether they evolve separately
[SPEAKER_00]: or evolve to be different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have one receptor, PHA2 in its
morpholog and rapidopsis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So presumably doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same phenotype, but up to
now, the genetics suggest that this one
[SPEAKER_00]: goes through G proteins and this one goes
through Carinae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really wanted to know, is this a
trans-species difference or are both
[SPEAKER_00]: systems operating in both monocots and
dicots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were fortunate to get a mutant of
Carinae in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this from Bob Mealy, a pioneer from
that transposon collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also got another allele from the
amazing populations developed by Jerry New
[SPEAKER_00]: for the EMS populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that Carinae indeed also is
faciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big meristems and a faciation in the
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that both Carinae and G alpha
function in maize in meristems signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, we use double mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have, I should have had a
summary here, but we have PHA2,
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptor, and then two possible
downstream signaling components,
[SPEAKER_00]: G alpha and Carinae.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we make double mutants between G alpha
and Carinae, they're additive or
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get these crazy faciations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more severe than the single
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this suggests they're different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, oops, that's a bit of a lag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we make double mutants between the
receptor and Carinae, so between PHA2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: Carinae, here we see epistasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the double mutants look like the single
mutants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in maize and meristems or just
looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of look not that much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PHA2 and Carinae are in the same
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carinae and CT2 are in different pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our earlier published work had shown
that PHA2 and CT2 are in different
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be on the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's getting very complicated,
but I'll have a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what we think is the receptor has
two different outputs, Carinae and G
[SPEAKER_00]: alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out, and this is from some early
work that we published, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk much about, that there are two
different Clavada 3-related proteins in
[SPEAKER_00]: maize that affect meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is called Cli7, which we think
is the Clavada 3-orthog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is called FCP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we crispered both of these to get
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have faciation in both cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we find, and this is the
important result, is that, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did these peptide sensitivity assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if a gene is involved in possession
of a peptide, the mutant should be
[SPEAKER_00]: insensitive to the peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that G alpha, or CT2,
is sensitive to one of the two peptides,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carinae is sensitive to the other
peptide and not the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, this is our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot of data, and even I get
confused by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our model is that we have two
different signals going through the same
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, two different peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is Cli7, which is the maize version of
Clavada 3, and one is FCP1, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: different Clavada 3-related peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different signals go through the same
receptor, and they come out to different
[SPEAKER_00]: outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you can ask me later how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that confusing, because we
think that these receptors do not work by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves, but they work in complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that Fe2 probably is a
scaffold for other receptors which give
[SPEAKER_00]: the specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one receptor complex binds
Clavada 3, and another receptor complex
[SPEAKER_00]: binds FCP1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd really like to know what those
are, but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least phenomenologically,
I think this is interesting, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: shows how you can get different signal
inputs and outputs going through its
[SPEAKER_00]: common receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to skip that,
because I'm probably running late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so there's another area we are
very interested in, which is looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: natural variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of this is actually inspired by
work from Ed Buckler and Mike Lee and
[SPEAKER_00]: others, where they've shown that we can
map QTLs for a kernel row number,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the trade we eventually want to
get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is natural genetic variation in
maize for, we think, for meristem size,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly for seed number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is me in our summer field last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a real corn plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't glue these together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the scale buyer, so it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Mexican land race from CIMIT,
the Maize and Wheat Research Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ordered these seeds, or seeds of
this line, because they're annotated as
[SPEAKER_00]: being spacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a land race that people grow and
eat in Mexico, and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked my undergrads to shoot back
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were climbing on each other's
shoulders and bringing ladders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I told them, you can just bend
them over, because they have stalks about
[SPEAKER_00]: six inches thick, so they're really
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to map this, but we're
not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another approach we've taken is to use
the NAMM population, which is this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: resource in maize, natural variation
resource, generated by Major Goodman and
[SPEAKER_00]: made famous by Ed Buckler and many other
people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a diversity population with
diverse, 25 diverse founder lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to find natural variation in
our trade of interest, which is faciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take one of our mutants,
like Fe2, and we cross it to all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity parents, and then make F2s and
score the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for modifiers,
genetic modifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of work, but it's kind of
fun to just walk through the field and put
[SPEAKER_00]: up in 10,000 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite activities,
but not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, when we did this, we found
that one of these lines, which is NC350,
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly enhanced the Fe2 phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So NC350 by itself is not faciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just natural inbred varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we cross NC350 with Fe2 and make
an F2, we go from a pretty strong
[SPEAKER_00]: faciation phenotype that looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the meristem is really flattened,
and the ear is flattened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get something like this,
which is just completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really faciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get my neurobiologist colleagues
interested in this till they realize it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really strongly enhanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to know, there's some locus in
NC350 that's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In wild type NC350, it's not doing
anything to the meristem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we put it in a mutant background,
which we think sensitizes the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we see this really strong
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we map this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this was originally really
difficult to map, because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things segregating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not just one major
locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do several back-crosses and then
make an F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a major locus on chromosome 5
that maps to this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we map this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right in the middle is one of our
favorite genes that I haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about yet, TD1, which is the maize
clavada1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clavada1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fe2 is clavada2, and TD1 is clavada1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting that within
this line, we've found that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: natural variation in TD1, which can
enhance this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've shown we've confirmed this by
mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, actually, I don't have it here
in the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a difference in expression in
TD1 in NC350 compared to B73, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: our starting line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is an extra resource we
can hopefully use to uncover new,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully in the future, new loci also
that control these traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last part of the talk, I want to just
come back to this idea again about
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing yield, or at least increasing
kernel number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the idea is these mutants make
massive disorganized meristems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we can control this gene,
i.e., a weak allele, we could make a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit bigger meristems and more rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally, we did this together with a
tilling facility in May set up by Cliff
[SPEAKER_00]: Weill of Purdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he screened for us in EMS populations
for alleles of Fe2 that had point
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations generated by EMS, just by
sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're predicted to give single amino
acid changes, so presumably weak alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for one of these, at least two of
them, but one was more dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually found that, indeed,
in these mutants, these weak alleles of
[SPEAKER_00]: Fe2, we do get an increase in kernel rows
from an average of about 16 to an average
[SPEAKER_00]: about 20, which is quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more kernels per ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really excited about this,
which is when we look at these in the
[SPEAKER_00]: scanning EM, we see that, indeed,
these weak alleles of Fe2, the meristems
[SPEAKER_00]: do, indeed, get a bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still organized, still this
nice dome shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not vacated, splitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really happy about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're making more kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we make more yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the answer is no, as I was
discussing with Bob this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are pretty smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try and trick it into making more rows
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, well, I'm just going to make
the seeds smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the plant did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no increase in yield in this
background, which is not what farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is W22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even a hybrid, which is what
we know in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been giving these lines out to
breeders here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, a former postdoc in my lab
is now a maize breeder in Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put this into their breeding lines
that they actually grow, that farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, again, saw an increase in kernel
row number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in their yield trials, this is real
breeders' yield trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not our crappy field in Long
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw up to a 20% increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be reproduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in some backgrounds,
this may really have an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this with another gene that we
worked on called Fe3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't really talked about this today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, we had weak alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they're still mildly faciated,
but nothing like the null mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are EMS, weak alleles.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, even in our old inbreds and
hybrids, just B73W22, we see a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: significant increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is not elite varieties,
of course, but encouraging that we may do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe these marathon pathways are
interacting somehow in pathways that
[SPEAKER_00]: control sync strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant only has a limited amount of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it does with that resources,
I think, is a mystery, how that's decided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be some interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to do this large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with the EMS alleles,
we were really lucky to get alleles that
[SPEAKER_00]: had the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make a more generalizable
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make weak alleles in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And targeting the protein sequence is a
little risky, because you could knock out
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know what you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And EMS is kind of messy and slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, of course, we have CRISPR,
which is this amazing new tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make weak alleles, we don't want to
target the coding sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we thought maybe we can target the
promoters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is with our clean mutants
in Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we take the prediction to
the promoter region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't care about promoter elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody asks, how did you predict which
promoter element is important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to get a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take the upstream 1 to 2 kb of
promoter and just tile it with 8 or 9
[SPEAKER_00]: guide RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we transform this into Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we get out is plants that have
all sorts of different genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have small indels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very common with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do CRISPR with multiple guide
RNAs, you also often get large deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get different promoter deletions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like in vivo promoter bashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I was a graduate student,
everybody was doing promoter bashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was really boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm actually quite excited about this,
because it's in vivo in the native genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had a lot of results from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen a paper published a few
months ago from Zach Lipman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing this together with Lipman
Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomato is much faster than Mays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they already have amazing allelic
variation in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can show you in Mays,
which is not very satisfying, is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do have some weak phenotypes, some weak
pasteation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no yield data yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's coming next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no reason it shouldn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I've hopefully convinced you or
confused you that the Clavada network is
[SPEAKER_00]: very confusing and complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CRISPR is just beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to get a lot worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to be in this great situation
where we had, oh, Clavada 3 binds Clavada
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that regulates which one is feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we now know that there are many more
receptors that function in meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these downstream signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot more that the paper I
just reviewed has four more over here that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a lot more stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a way, that's biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's interesting to think about
why it's so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can discuss that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're making headway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the clis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Clavada 3, as I said, is this clea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a member of a big gene family.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actually 49 in maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't dare ask my postdoc to knock
out all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's actually done about 20 of them
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all in the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all have to be crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amazing power of CRISPR,
we're now knocking out four genes at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could go tomorrow, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are going to change very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're focusing on only about 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to be more modest in my
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ones that are most highly
expressed in fluorescence, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there'll be lots of
interesting phenotypes coming out of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more than we can ever study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's very powerful now to
think about not looking at single genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that redundancy is very
prevalent in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to think about knocking out
whole gene families to find phenotypes.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so how complicated is it,
Barry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then something I think about a lot
also is, to what extent is yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: crop yields, limited by sync?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about this, a lot of
people say, well, yield is source limited,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant only makes a certain amount of
photosynthate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that goes to the ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can't make more by making the
ear bigger, because you only have a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some of our works, yes,
it may not be true, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe some of the resources are
kept in the roots or kept in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're funneling more of that into the
ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether that's good or not for
sustainability, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting to think about
whether this can be used to enhance yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this has already been optimized in
corn belt maize, because breeders have
[SPEAKER_00]: been breeding maize for almost 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But probably not in all environments,
as I showed you with the lines from
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, there's a lot of interest
now in developing new crops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Orphan crops, improving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these pathways could be very
useful in improving yield in crops that
[SPEAKER_00]: are not common in row crops now.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so yeah, I just want to acknowledge
people who did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In green are the people involved in
clavada-related projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other people are doing different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work is done by a very
talented postdoc, Byung-Il.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just got a job back in Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Peter Baumert is back in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a great group of
collaborators and funding agencies and et
[SPEAKER_00]: cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and thanks very much.
Thank you.
We have two questions.
So what you call yield is actually the
weight of the ear.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it translate to two ears per
acre?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that depends on how these things do
at high density, which we have not
[SPEAKER_00]: measured yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ongoing, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my second question is, have you ever
looked at the signatures of selection
[SPEAKER_04]: around any of those genes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't go into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these genes come up in QTL
scans or in GWAS studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's variation that's associated
with yield traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whether they're selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genes did not come out in the
Doebly screen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Doebly crossed ancient maize and T.
[SPEAKER_00]: asyntae and found major QTLs, five major
QTLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these genes are not in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one interesting gene in there,
actually leafy, the maize leafy homolog,
[SPEAKER_00]: which he showed may be also involved in
controlling row number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think of these genes as not in
the original domestication events,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more in improvement events,
in the more recent evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, well, they did not come up in the
Doebly data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: TD1 actually came out of the paper it
published last year, I think in current
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, that Jeff Rossiabara was on where
they sequenced ancient maize from these
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 year old cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that TD1 was already under
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's there, but we haven't
looked too deeply into that.
Eric?
So you're using kernel row number as a
proxy for baristem size or initiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any examples where you see essentially
more kernel rows, but the baristem looks
[SPEAKER_04]: normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we actually, it happens,
and obviously kernel size can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get more rows by having smaller
kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, we looked at all the NAMs,
found the lines and tried to correlate
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel row number with baristem size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think baristem size variation
explained about 60% of the difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: kernel row number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a substantial part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is about this sort
of branching receptor pathway and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptor interacts directly with G
alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we published that paper in 2013 that
the receptor interacts with G alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Peter went off and got his job,
and he left the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another postdoc joined and could
not repeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really nervous for a while,
but eventually got the conditions right,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he repeated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we detect the interaction by co-IP,
but not by FRET or BIFC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think there's another protein that
bridges that interaction, and we think
[SPEAKER_00]: that is the receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't, yeah, we haven't been able
to purify it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like you've got lots of
parallels between Arabinopsis and Maze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there some real differences in the
signaling pathways?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Maze is somehow more
sensitized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we find, well, so we found a
lot of things in Arabinopsis, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maze that have not been found in
Arabinopsis, like PHA-4, G alpha,
[SPEAKER_00]: and PHA-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we've gone back and looked more
carefully in Arabinopsis, we found the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes, either by making double mutant
or, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't seen anything that's really
obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of happy about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have this sort of friendly
back and forth with Elliot Meyerowitz that
[SPEAKER_00]: he always, you know, he's a bit,
he's not listening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a bit of an ego, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll just, if we find something in
Maze that hasn't been found in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabinopsis, he'll just say, oh,
well, you just show that things are weird
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's thank David.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
