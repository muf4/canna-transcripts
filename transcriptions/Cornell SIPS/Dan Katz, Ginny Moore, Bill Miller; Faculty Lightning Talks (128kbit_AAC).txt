[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the work that my lab does on
[SPEAKER_02]: plant ecology and public health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mission of my group is to quantify
plant-human interactions to inform
[SPEAKER_02]: decision making and ultimately to improve
public health.
[SPEAKER_02]: To do so, we seek to answer questions
including how can we measure, model,
[SPEAKER_02]: and scale up processes that are health
relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also seek to answer what are the public
health consequences of plants and who is
[SPEAKER_02]: most affected by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately we seek to use this
information and to leverage it to inform
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions that will improve human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of different ways in
which plants interact with people from a
[SPEAKER_02]: health perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our day-to-day lives we may benefit
from the cooling effects of trees on a hot
[SPEAKER_02]: day or from the more subtle but still
important removal of air pollutants like
[SPEAKER_02]: particulate matter by urban plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants also have all sorts of other
effects too, everything from mental health
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits to hydrological effects like that
can reduce flooding in urban areas of
[SPEAKER_02]: course these plants also have negative
effects too such as the production of
[SPEAKER_02]: allergenic pollen or the production of
volatile organic compounds which
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute to ozone formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm mostly going to tell you about
one of these in particular which is
[SPEAKER_02]: allergenic pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go a little bit into why
this is important and what we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and then I'll talk about some
other stuff that I do too as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of what we know about airborne
pollen comes from empirical measurements
[SPEAKER_02]: taken across the United States by the
Sparse Monitoring Network.
[SPEAKER_02]: To give you a sense of how this works I'm
going to zoom into the Finger Lakes
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are over here in Ithaca and the
nearest of these pollen monitoring
[SPEAKER_02]: stations to us is up in Rochester which is
about 80 miles away from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it works is there's a sampler that
looks kind of like this on top of the roof
[SPEAKER_02]: of a single building up there and this
sampler draws in air that has pollen and
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal spores and other things like that
in it and then once a day a technician
[SPEAKER_02]: goes up to that rooftop takes the sample
out of the device manually identifies the
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen grains and then reports that
information to the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what does this mean if you live in say
Fall Creek?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well there's a few pieces to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately what was measured in
Rochester in the morning that was those
[SPEAKER_02]: measurements were taken over the previous
24 hour periods so you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday's data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also pollen concentrations vary by orders
of magnitude over spatial scales of
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of meters and so what's happening
a hundred kilometers away isn't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: give you very useful information about
what is going to happen today for you here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so without that information you may
not be able to make behavioral decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: like deciding whether you're going for a
run that day or whether you should close
[SPEAKER_02]: your windows and it also doesn't really
tell you whether you should take your
[SPEAKER_02]: allergy medication which is important
because a lot of these medications take at
[SPEAKER_02]: least 24 or 48 hours to hit full efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for a lot of people who have allergies
and this is a lot of people somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: around 20-25 percent of Americans for
folks that have allergies this merely
[SPEAKER_02]: makes them miserable right but there's a
lot of people out there who have asthma or
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and
for these people exposure to pollen can be
[SPEAKER_02]: much more serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a real need for creating models
of airborne pollen and that is what a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of my work focuses on and so I do a few
different things in order to generate
[SPEAKER_02]: these models.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make use of I do a lot of field work and
I also use remote sensing ranging from
[SPEAKER_02]: drones to satellites to try and understand
things like where are the plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: producing pollen, how much pollen is being
produced, when is it being released and
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately how does it disperse through
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all of the ingredients necessary
for creating process-based models of
[SPEAKER_02]: airborne pollen concentrations and
ultimately this is what we need to do in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to get this information and
predictions about pollen concentrations
[SPEAKER_02]: out to relevant stakeholders as well as
people with allergies who can use this
[SPEAKER_02]: information to improve their health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm now going to take just a tiny bit
of time to tell you about what this looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like in practice and so some of this might
involve things like using the color of
[SPEAKER_02]: these pollen cones for this species in
Texas to try and scale up predictions of
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen production.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Hannah who's a graduate student in
my lab and doing a fantastic job of trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to use these remote sensing indices to
understand this at spatial scales ranging
[SPEAKER_02]: from meters up to site level and
eventually as we incorporate more
[SPEAKER_02]: satellite data to even larger scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is kind of an example of some
of what's done in my lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do a little bit of work on other
things besides pollen and so one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: topics that we're working on right now is
trying to understand the cooling effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of trees a little bit better so that we
can keep people out of the emergency
[SPEAKER_02]: department during heat waves and this is
some work that's so far mostly focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are a few examples, plenty of
other ones everything from identifying
[SPEAKER_02]: individual trees with remote sensing data
to understanding correlations between
[SPEAKER_02]: urban tree composition and neighborhood
demography of people that is things like
[SPEAKER_02]: income and race and ethnicity and I also
do a little bit of some other stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: creating novel devices messing around with
Arduinos and trying to come up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: tools that I need in order to take the
measurements that are required.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I suppose with that I would also like
to highlight some of the other folks that
[SPEAKER_02]: are in my lab with me doing this work
including Hannah Zonneville, Dave Miller
[SPEAKER_02]: and several other students as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if any of this is interesting to you,
come and stop by.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up on the 10th floor of Bradfield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to chit chat with you all about
any of these topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have any questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think pollen data can be used as an
indicator of ecological health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's certainly useful for a lot of
ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I got into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: My background is plant ecology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it can be useful for understanding
things like phenology, the timing of life
[SPEAKER_02]: history events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecosystem health for me, I'd say for me,
I think about it a little bit more from
[SPEAKER_02]: the perspective of like particular types
of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can tell you like, hey, are there a
lot of plants of a particular type in a
[SPEAKER_02]: particular area?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's whole subfields around
paleoecology that use pollen for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be quite a useful tool for
particular things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the state level, the New York state
level, is there a very robust tension
[SPEAKER_05]: between those promoting ecosystem services
and cooling of trees and then human health
[SPEAKER_05]: concerns?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that, do those stakeholders not
necessarily meet each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you get all sorts of interesting
politics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lot of people,
including me, who think trees are great
[SPEAKER_02]: and we should have a lot of them in
cities, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one and a half billion dollars
going into community and urban forestry
[SPEAKER_02]: right now through the Inflation Reduction
Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of people who care a lot
about trees and want them in cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sometimes people get a little
offended when you say, hey, they do bad
[SPEAKER_02]: things too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are some folks who would
rather ignore anything bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I think you really need to take
both the good and the bad, weigh them all
[SPEAKER_02]: against each other to make good decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for the invitation to speak with
you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jenny Moore, and I'm an assistant
professor in plant breeding and genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today I'll be giving an overview of my
lab's work, which focuses on plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for sustainable cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're housed in the plant breeding and
genetics section, but we also tread into
[SPEAKER_01]: the disciplines of agronomy and
agroecology, integrating management and
[SPEAKER_01]: social science questions, along with our
genetics and breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I start, I want to acknowledge
the contributions of the staff and
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate students and many undergrads that
have worked in my lab over the last four
[SPEAKER_01]: years since I started at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our work is spanning disciplines,
and we work on a lot of different crops
[SPEAKER_01]: and systems and do a lot of field work in
all kinds of weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really adaptable and hardy and
hardworking bunch of folks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plant breeding for sustainable cropping
systems, this encompasses a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different ideas and practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this term, sustainable cropping
systems, encompasses a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas and practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided to structure my presentation
today around the lens of soil health as a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific way to think about sustainable
cropping systems and thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for characteristics of plants
that keep this long-term goal of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this framework that I have on the
slide here, it was developed by USDA's
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural Resources Conservation Service
describing these principles that encompass
[SPEAKER_01]: a range of farming practices that maximize
living roots, soil cover, and biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: while minimizing soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for plant breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can approach working on these
principles and improving these practices
[SPEAKER_01]: with genetics by either improving plant
traits that support sustainability goals
[SPEAKER_01]: or plant traits that support farmer
adoption of sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, my lab, we do some of
both, improving sustainability-related
[SPEAKER_01]: traits directly or thinking about farmer
adoption, but we perhaps skew a little
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the latter approach, thinking
about how we can make it easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers to conduct practices that we
already know enhance sustainability goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to structure my
presentation around these four principles
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one that I'll talk about is
maximizing living roots, which one way
[SPEAKER_01]: that we do this in our lab is breeding
perennial forage crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forages are especially important for
New York State because of the prominence
[SPEAKER_01]: of New York's dairy industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen, despite the many
sustainability benefits that forages can
[SPEAKER_01]: provide, we've seen long-term declines in
forage acreage in New York State and
[SPEAKER_01]: nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been consistent over many
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of factors
involved, economic and policy factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges with managing forages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these, I think, are a little
outside of the scope of what plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding can address.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the management factors
especially, I think, breeding has a
[SPEAKER_01]: contribution to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main areas that acreage has
been shrinking over the last over 100
[SPEAKER_01]: years is down to levels below what they
were 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the factors that has really
contributed to management challenges in
[SPEAKER_01]: forages is plant establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So alfalfa seed can be pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers struggle to consistently
establish stands that are uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few different factors that
affect establishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is auto toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a form of self-allelopathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mature alfalfa plants produce compounds
that suppress germination and growth of
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it can be especially hard when you
have a failed stand of alfalfa to then
[SPEAKER_01]: come in and replant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compounds can stay in the soil and
affect establishment for up to a year
[SPEAKER_01]: after a stand is terminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've initiated a project looking at
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see examples here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the top picture, we have alfalfa
seedlings that have been germinated in
[SPEAKER_01]: distilled water versus an extract from
alfalfa tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the effect that it has on
germination and growth of those seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one project that we're working on
is developing alfalfa populations with
[SPEAKER_01]: high and low production of autotoxic
compounds and high and low susceptibility
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can both understand the
fundamental genetic mechanisms underlying
[SPEAKER_01]: this characteristic and develop varieties
that are better able to establish
[SPEAKER_01]: following a previous alfalfa stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next soil health principle that we
work on is maximizing soil cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we approach this by breeding for
overwintering cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the director of the National Cover
Crop Breeding Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a group of plant breeders and
farmers and agronomists across the country
[SPEAKER_01]: who are seeking to develop new cover crop
varieties that are better adapted to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer needs and regional conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we work on several different
overwintering cover crops, including
[SPEAKER_01]: winter annual legume species, as well as
cereal rye and several brassica species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're breeding for a number of
different traits primarily related to
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer adoption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like early vigor, ability to
survive the winter in cold climates,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ability to produce a lot of biomass,
which is correlated with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem service benefits that farmers
are seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also lead the winter pea breeding
program within our larger network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the traits that we're
specifically interested in winter pea is
[SPEAKER_01]: overwintering ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not consistently overwintering in
northern locations in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we recently acquired a cold
temperature growth chamber that will allow
[SPEAKER_01]: us to do more rapid evaluation of our pea
germplasm and select populations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: better adapted to survive the winter in
New York and in other locations across the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're screening for cold tolerance
in a wide range of pea accessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this work is largely led by my PhD
student, Raksha Thapa, who has really
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneered development of these protocols
in our lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third principle that we work on,
maximizing biodiversity, we think about
[SPEAKER_01]: this largely through breeding for multi
crop systems, things like intercropping,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding for mixtures of different species
to grow well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one system that we work on is breeding
alfalfa for intercropping with
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate wheatgrass, which is a
perennial grain crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're looking to develop alfalfa
that can be a suitable companion for
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediate wheatgrass and for use in
dual purpose systems producing both
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial grain and forage biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's an example of row
intercropping that we're pursuing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have a project focused on
breeding red clover for intercropping with
[SPEAKER_01]: corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an example of relay
intercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plant the corn first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a period where it's a single
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we intercede red clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has to survive under the corn
canopy for several months before the corn
[SPEAKER_01]: is harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the red clover can continue
growing and provide cover cropping and
[SPEAKER_01]: forage benefits for farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final principle I wanted to
discuss is minimizing disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we approach this by evaluating variety
performance in reduced tillage systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as some of you might be familiar with
in inorganic cropping systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers tend to rely on tillage as a tool
to manage weeds rather than using
[SPEAKER_01]: herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has a real significant trade off
in terms of soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is interest in developing
reduced tillage organic weed management
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, for example, using cover crops as
a mulch to suppress weed growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example of one of our
technicians, Josie Chavez, roller crimping
[SPEAKER_01]: a rye cover crop or a rye, it looks like
rye, hairy vetch cover crop that we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: then plant a cash crop into directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've done some variety trials with
a couple of different main crop species
[SPEAKER_01]: with hemp and with dry beans to evaluate
variety adaptation to these reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: tillage cover crop based systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can be a kind of challenging
environment for cash crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to emerge, germinate in cold
soil and emerge through this thick layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of biomass that the mulch comprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on the cover crop that
you're using, you might also have
[SPEAKER_01]: significant nitrogen tie up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be a challenging environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're evaluating variation in different
crop varieties to perform in these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also done some comparisons of
different dry bean cultivars between
[SPEAKER_01]: tilled and no till systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is work that's been led by a
master's student, Erica Everest,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also part of a larger organic dry
bean project that some other folks in SITS
[SPEAKER_01]: are involved with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for maybe one question.
Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the Elphaba, the reason they make
this compound is because you said you have
[SPEAKER_04]: the extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea what is in that
extract?
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you pull it back to a bean or some
sort of other system where they looked at
[SPEAKER_04]: knocking these out or making resistant
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still learning what the compounds
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not been identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are multiple compounds that are
producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that are producing this effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is variation in both production
and susceptibility in our Elphaba
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are working with some folks at
Michigan State to identify compounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: also look at interactions with soil
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a super complex system that
we're still definitely unraveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mostly going to talk a little bit
about our flower bulb program that we had
[SPEAKER_06]: done for 25 years here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm mostly a greenhouse crops person,
not vegetables, not edible food,
[SPEAKER_06]: but ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about greenhouse crops and
we've done a lot of work with flower bulbs
[SPEAKER_06]: and carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: So bulbs are big bags of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were quite interested in learning
more about that over the last long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I also teach the greenhouse
management course, which we'll talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: that a little bit, which many of you
participate in that helping to teach that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we worked for 25 years with the Dutch
Flower Bulb Export Association,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was sort of an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a program that they started in
1965.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was sort of a research slash
extension program to generate information
[SPEAKER_06]: that was useful for greenhouse producers
in the US and Canada, and also landscape
[SPEAKER_06]: people, nurseries, anyone commercially who
was using flower bulbs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for them, they would support this
research and some outreach.
[SPEAKER_06]: And presumably that would help the
industry with their flower bulb problems
[SPEAKER_06]: and they would buy more bulbs from the
Dutch.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the second person to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the last person, the first
person was Guster Hurtog.
[SPEAKER_06]: He started at Michigan State and then
ended up at North Carolina State.
[SPEAKER_06]: They published a book after 50 years,
which was really quite nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the nice things about this,
we had a number of interns.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 18 Dutch interns.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry every year would send,
you know, practically hundreds of
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of bulbs for experiments that we
did at the greenhouse and in the
[SPEAKER_06]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they would also send an intern to help
plant everything and collect the data.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: These were young students.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them were 21.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them were not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drinking age in Holland is certainly
less than 21.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they carried that on whenever they got
here in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had open houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had all kinds of industry visitors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I only know of one arrest of these
interns.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really quite a funny story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to tell you about it,
but maybe not here on the camera while
[SPEAKER_06]: things are being recorded.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if I do this, this is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the things that we did,
really the work was based on interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: problems in the greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as forcing a flower bulbs,
either as potted plants or as cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there were all kinds of cultivar
trials of tulips, daffodils and hydrangeas
[SPEAKER_06]: and lilies and all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the issues with the production of
greenhouse crops in pots is height
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might say, well, you could always
breed dwarf or plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course you can, but that's not
always possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's quite common.
[SPEAKER_06]: To use anti-gibberland growth retardants
in greenhouse production of ornamental
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did some interesting work with Ethafon
and realized that Ethafon, which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: liquid, it's called liquid ethylene,
two chloroethyl phosphonic acid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It releases ethylene in plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least in our tulips and daffodils,
it crosses into the root.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it moves freely upwards in the xylem,
which was quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we developed methods of applying
Ethafon as a soil application,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is quite unique for growth
regulators.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a lot of work on GA-47,
which turns out as a very potent inhibitor
[SPEAKER_06]: of leaf senescence in lilies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either as cut flowers or potted plants,
many of the lily cultivars have pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: atrocious leaf chlorosis towards the end
of their production cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the work that we did, and this was
really Anil Randhwala when we first moved
[SPEAKER_06]: here from Clemson in 1998.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anil did a lot of great work and it
eventually expanded existing labels for
[SPEAKER_06]: GA-47 to be used on lilies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Easter lilies, that you buy at
Easter time, if they have green leaves on
[SPEAKER_06]: them, you can be certain they were treated
with GA-47.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have yellow leaves and they look
bad, you can be certain that they were not
[SPEAKER_06]: treated with GA-47.
[SPEAKER_06]: So practically, all of the lilies grown in
North America are treated with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did work in these bud development
meters.
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes interesting in greenhouses when
you're growing crops for a holiday period.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have to have that plant flowering
X number of days before the holiday so
[SPEAKER_06]: that you can sell it and get it into the
stores in order for people to buy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is critical, not on a weekly cycle
when you can have it go to market at any
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're growing for holidays,
you've got, like Easter lilies,
[SPEAKER_06]: key example, you have to have these plants
available at the right time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you start looking at the
temperature, the lighting, all the
[SPEAKER_06]: different things that you can do to make
the plant flower on time, being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: predict when the plant's going to flower
is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with lilies, well, there's just
gazillions of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we spent a lot of time working on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The trouble is the lily breeders breed
more lilies than we really need.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a lot of work there that,
well, it's nice work, but bye-bye,
[SPEAKER_06]: because those cultivars all go away pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some interesting stuff about
fusarium and ethylene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fusarium produces ethylene and causes very
severe problems on tulips, especially when
[SPEAKER_06]: they're shipped in containers on vessels
from Rotterdam to New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting stuff about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant planting depth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something as simple as literally how deep
you plant a bare root perennial is either
[SPEAKER_06]: leading to success or failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a huge bare root perennial
industry in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if these plants are planted like an
inch or two inches deep in a pot,
[SPEAKER_06]: according to what the directions are,
80% of them will not grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they require a certain amount of light,
certain stimulus to actually start
[SPEAKER_06]: growing, and very, very simple
experiments, but quite useful experiments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the thing that we've occupied ourselves
for the last few years, because we have
[SPEAKER_06]: this planter.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dutch sent us this planter with
100,000 bulbs, and they said, go plant
[SPEAKER_06]: some stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very interesting planter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you would have seen, if you go
downtown, you would have seen the results
[SPEAKER_06]: of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bioswale and the botanical garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the McClintock shed.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is down right near Boatyard Grill,
Cass Park.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've planted about a half million
daffodils downtown in the last five years
[SPEAKER_06]: that I think have been very nicely
received.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done research.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're planting bulbs in the grass,
which is what this machine does,
[SPEAKER_06]: it lifts the sod, drops the bulbs under
the sod, and then replaces the sod as the
[SPEAKER_06]: tractor drives along.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question then becomes, when can you
mow the grass?
[SPEAKER_06]: When can you mow the bulbs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we need to have foliage in order
to build the bulb back up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a conflict, and we've done work
to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about June 10th.
[SPEAKER_06]: Downtown, or down on Long Island,
75,000 bulbs, three hours, three people
[SPEAKER_06]: with this machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the companies have brought in about 15
of these machines in the last three years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've been pretty widely adapted
throughout the Northeast and down into the
[SPEAKER_06]: South.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've helped with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see you're about ready to stand up,
so I'm going to stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering, are there any elusive
traits that you or other readers have gone
[SPEAKER_03]: after for bulbs?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any what kind of traits?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really desirable, but impossible to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_06]: A black tulip.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are very dark, dark, dark purple
tulips, but no black tulips.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the cool things, if you ever get a
chance to go to Holland, there's a great,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the springtime, there's a garden up
above Alecmar, near Alecmar, called the
[SPEAKER_06]: Hortus Balborum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a living collection of ancient
tulip cultivars, including intentional
[SPEAKER_06]: probably virus-infected plants,
the whole tulip mania and all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are cultivars, or there's tulip
germplasm that coexists pretty happily
[SPEAKER_06]: with the virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually, tulip-breaking virus is fatal
after a few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But some genetic backgrounds tolerate that
widely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they will have 3,000 of these infected
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Infected tulip's all the same kind of
color and pattern.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's astounding.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Bill, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
