[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dave Bruce, my executive director of
New York Farm Viability Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, also thanking Cornell for
putting this together and developing your
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you a little background
about Farm Viability for those of you that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't aware and then talk a little bit
about our role in soil health projects
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Farm Viability started as a grant from
USDA Rural Development in 2003 to Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: for an Ag Innovation Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of 10 grants across the United
States, and it is the only remnant of that
[SPEAKER_01]: program that's still in operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that grant wound down, the board of
directors for that grant program,
[SPEAKER_01]: which included Ag and Markets Farm Bureau,
the largest agricultural commodities in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state, CAO, said, can we create
something that will outlive this initial
[SPEAKER_01]: grant from USDA?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came up with the idea of a
farmer-led, farmer-directed organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofit, that would provide guidance for
applied agricultural research and
[SPEAKER_01]: education programs for agriculture across
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they took the idea to the state
legislature, and they liked it and funded
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2005, we received our first shot of
funding and first started funding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get started heading off in
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, going the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2005, we started our first projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a 10-member board of directors
that are all farmers and volunteer on our
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fund applied agricultural research,
education, and business development
[SPEAKER_01]: projects across all agricultural
commodities in New York state and across
[SPEAKER_01]: all areas of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We utilize an outcome-based funding model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The board wants to know what will be
measurably different at the farm level as
[SPEAKER_01]: a result of funding this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of our projects are reviewed by
farmer review panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 17 review panels that look at
different agricultural areas, and we
[SPEAKER_01]: activate those panels based on the
applications that we receive in any
[SPEAKER_01]: particular grant year.
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 review panels, and we engage over 100
farmers on those review panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this past year, we've also added
agri-service professionals to those panels
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always trying to recruit people,
so if anyone is interested in being a
[SPEAKER_01]: grant reviewer for farm viability
projects, let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put you to work in January and
February reviewing proposals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of soil health projects,
we fund the soil health projects in the
[SPEAKER_01]: very first year of our existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2005, we funded two projects that were
soil health-oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that time, we've funded 41 soil
health-related projects or projects that
[SPEAKER_01]: contain soil health components across nine
different organizations that utilized our
[SPEAKER_01]: funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those organizations certainly
include Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dave mentioned earlier, we provided
some of the funding for the soil health
[SPEAKER_01]: soil test and getting it utilized more
widely across the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provided some funding to, Dave
mentioned, Elson Shields and the nematode
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've provided funding to Elson over the
years for that, provided funding to NOFA
[SPEAKER_01]: New York for some of the soil health
workshop work that they have done,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also a project that we funded with
American Farmland Trust a couple of years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago looking at interseeding in corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another number of projects over those
41 projects, we invested over $3.6 million
[SPEAKER_01]: in soil health related projects since
2005, so not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the areas that we've looked at in terms
of the soil projects, we've funded
[SPEAKER_01]: projects in grain production, forage
production, viticulture, vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of Anu's work in minimum till and
vegetables, no-till vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: high-tunnel soil management, and manure
management projects, to name a few there
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of what we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so in 2018 and going forward,
so in 2018, we had a kind of a special
[SPEAKER_01]: emphasis on soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to get project leaders whose
projects didn't really fall in line as a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil health project that might have soil
health implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we funded a lot of vegetable
production work and flower production work
[SPEAKER_01]: in high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody thought about soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, boom, we have soil
health problems and issues in high
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we need to resolve those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody thought about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're providing funding to researchers who
are applying various chemicals and
[SPEAKER_01]: additives to the soil to control insects
or diseases, but not really thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily about the impact on soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to try and get people to
start thinking about how their projects
[SPEAKER_01]: might be related to soil health.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2019, we're gonna maintain a focus on
soil health and also encourage projects to
[SPEAKER_01]: be submitted in the soil health arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those projects still have to be good
quality projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not receive any preferential
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have to compete with all of our
other projects going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for Bill, so one thing I will say,
in closing here is that the Fund for
[SPEAKER_01]: Viability Institute and our board is
committed to soil health long-term and in
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of staying in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking forward to the
development of the soil health roadmap
[SPEAKER_01]: that will be talked about later today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the guidance that that
document will hopefully provide to
[SPEAKER_01]: universities, to extension associations,
to soil and water conservation districts,
[SPEAKER_01]: to agencies, to NGOs like American
Farmland Trust and others, and help to
[SPEAKER_01]: consolidate and coordinate the work that's
done in the soil health arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Farm Viability is looking forward to
funding those kinds of activities across
[SPEAKER_01]: all those organizations in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll turn it over to Jeff to take us
to lunch.
