[SPEAKER_11]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were really exciting talks.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I noticed as sort
of a theme through all the talks was the
[SPEAKER_07]: environmental sustainability that's coming
along with this food revolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in addition to having fresh,
nutritious, locally sourced foods,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's also a more environmentally
sustainable system in many cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael, can you talk a little bit more
about the lack of food waste and how
[SPEAKER_07]: that's helping environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of a lot of the energy we put
into a farm, if you think about what our
[SPEAKER_00]: presence on the planet means in terms of
the water we use, where we get fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: for the crops to grow, and all the
cultivation, all the energy that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of getting the crop ready in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things we can do is to look
at how to use more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's work like I'm doing to be
able to see how we can get more of that to
[SPEAKER_00]: be edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the complementary work,
and a lot I do with Chris, on trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at how you can avoid some of the
diseases and pests that might go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: cause a great loss of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a flood moves in, some diseases move
in, how can you make plants more resilient
[SPEAKER_00]: to what might happen through the season?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we're working on kind of
combining all those, and then of course it
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to the things that Thomas was
sharing about how you can look at some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply chains and get more of that
crop kind of fitting into what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to buy in addition to what I'm
doing to try to encourage and expand what
[SPEAKER_00]: is working really well in a given
environment and can be translated to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner table.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we'll get to questions in just
one second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to bring up one more point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both Thomas, well actually Thomas Courtney
and Carmen all brought up the point that
[SPEAKER_07]: Cornell and Cal's does have a campus in
Geneva, New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's about 300 people there working
there now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're celebrating the Geneva campus is
celebrating its 135th anniversary this
[SPEAKER_07]: year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Carmen, I know you said the high
pressure processing machine was there in
[SPEAKER_07]: Geneva.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm interested to know, I know you said
that the Teflon coating that could be used
[SPEAKER_07]: to prevent bacteria from sticking was
increasing environmental sustainability
[SPEAKER_07]: because you might not use other chemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: In any way, does the HPP machine increase
environmental sustainability?
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, many of these non-thermal,
we call them non-thermal technologies are
[SPEAKER_08]: not relying on heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So because you don't have to put so much
thermal energy into the processing and you
[SPEAKER_08]: don't have to cool after that,
there are some savings depending on the
[SPEAKER_08]: product, depending on how energy intensive
the product is in the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: So both high pressure but also other
things other technologies like post
[SPEAKER_08]: electric field and other things that we
are going to use have been demonstrated in
[SPEAKER_08]: certain cases to reduce the use of energy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, with high pressure,
you treat the product in package already.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it removes the need for repackaging
after that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also it increases shelf life because
you have treated the product, the terminal
[SPEAKER_08]: treatment, you don't have any post process
contamination.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that could extend the shelf life and
also has the energy benefits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just the last comment on the Teflon,
that was kind of a catchy phrase from the
[SPEAKER_08]: media.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our surface actually is not Teflon,
like Teflon for bacteria, they called it,
[SPEAKER_08]: leave it to the media to call it catchy
waste, but it's really just metallic
[SPEAKER_08]: surface.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a metal oxide.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: So are there questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two part question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your definition of local?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does the definition of local
eventually hurt them marketing wise
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can only be local?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thomas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Local is a term that's not legally
defined, of course, so it means whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumer needs it to mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are many attributes of local,
many reasons people want to buy local.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it depends, which one is most
important depends on the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the attributes of local is that
it's fresher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're interested in the freshness
of your produce, buying it so that it
[SPEAKER_03]: traveled less is an important criterion
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can also be that you want to feel a
connectedness to the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in a small town, you want to
know that this person who went to school
[SPEAKER_03]: with your mother grew the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an important aspect of local in
some situations, less so in big cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also the regional
connectedness, the regional identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from my place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really very important to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how far my place extends depends on
the type of community you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you end up with some oddities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in New York City, in the restaurant
food service trade, they use the Pride of
[SPEAKER_03]: New York label as their indicator of
local.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it comes from Buffalo, it's local.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it comes from northern New Jersey,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a cultural definition of local.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the exact definition depends on what
the quality of localness is that somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: is after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are many different legitimate
ones that have to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you think that impacts markets was
sort of the follow up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it impacts markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tremendously.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see here in the supermarkets,
where we are out in the country,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll put pictures of the farmer in
which little town the farm is in to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop that connectedness.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we take the fresh for granted in
the summertime anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: About what impact climate change may have
on your plant breeding focus as it relates
[SPEAKER_06]: to crop adaptation and pest resistance or
managing pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing in the berry world not
only climate change changing the climate
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So California has just went through a
large drought period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, now that's been broken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last summer here, it didn't rain also for
weeks and weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year, it hasn't stopped raining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's certainly what we see in the pest
side of things, the pressure changes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you add into that the reduction in use
of what we call fumigants, and these are
[SPEAKER_02]: used in a lot of the berry production to
reduce the pests in the soil before they
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of these chemicals are harmful to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're phasing them out in many
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now so we have the berry growers and
the berry breeders have had to concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: more resources toward making sure the
plant can withstand diseases that they
[SPEAKER_02]: used to just avoid through their
production practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having better root tolerance to
heavier soils, to pathogens, to wet and
[SPEAKER_02]: dry climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then being able to breed varieties
that will grow in more modern production
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, such as the protected
agriculture, the tunnels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the things that grow well in the
field don't necessarily grow well under
[SPEAKER_02]: those conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so combining both production practices
with some of the environmental problems
[SPEAKER_02]: has really changed my focus on how we deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just add a little bit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the process of plant
breeding, we're always finding the best of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best and finding a plant with one set
of great attributes and another plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: has something that will complement that,
that will add to that when they're crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I'm increasingly looking to
more global sources for plants that might
[SPEAKER_00]: not be, I might not be crossing two plants
that are exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might confuse them if you see them as
being the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at some of the more kind of
wilder versions or the versions of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber that a different culture would
use in India, Thailand, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: having many of these climate conditions
we're bracing ourselves for and making
[SPEAKER_00]: those, making that exchange between
cultures at the seed level and our food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'm bringing the resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have the easiest one on that
one because we're breeding for tolerance
[SPEAKER_03]: to warmer nights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is clearly one of the trends that
we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having that trait developed in this
particular crop is going to help continue
[SPEAKER_03]: to have production in the areas where it's
continuing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also, of course, looking at ways to
raise the crop that have lower impacts on
[SPEAKER_03]: climate change that are better storage of
carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a piece of the production also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at both ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, certainly the locally sourced
movement has, in the East, has been very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the Pacific Northwest has also
been very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is availability because they
can grow a lot of horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then people start to think,
well, why are we getting it from so far
[SPEAKER_02]: away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, in December, berries are not
really sourceable from New York for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most part, January, February.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that certainly is part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it is the environmental part of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it is people think, well,
it doesn't make sense to grow things and
[SPEAKER_02]: ship it in a truck all the way across the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the economics and the
carbon footprint doesn't always match that
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are yield differences in
different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And strawberries in California yield about
three times as much per acre as they do in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that balance for the carbon
footprint may not be as advantageous
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not just about shipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a combination of the shipping part
of it and the quality part of it that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to combine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others make a comment?
[SPEAKER_07]: The microphone is on its way.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question and a comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a faithful eater of broccoli for
numerous years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I found a chart by the Center of
Disease Control that said watercress was
[SPEAKER_09]: 100% nutrient-dense and broccoli's 38.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was wondering, are you doing any work
with watercress as being higher nutrition?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I didn't realize that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been eating broccoli forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think part of it is that a lot of the
nutrients are in the green part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with broccoli, the center of the stem
doesn't have as much of some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vitamins that they're counting in their
nutrient density calculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the trade-offs, of course,
is that it's easier to eat a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can easily eat three times as much
broccoli as watercress in most situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the total nutrient impact,
they end up being similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The crucifers in general are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to make a comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I received my nutrition degree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I graduated from here 40 years ago and
developed the lean cuisine products for
[SPEAKER_09]: Stouffer's, the first 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I retired end of December 2015 and
went to India on a medical admissions trip
[SPEAKER_09]: with doctors, dentists, and nurses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the areas where we're going up
the stairs to the center, and someone from
[SPEAKER_09]: my team said, look out the window.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I saw all this rubble from the
construction breaking down, demolish it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said the children live there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no bathroom, nothing, food,
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they come every day and they get one
hot meal and they can shower in the area
[SPEAKER_09]: that I was working at.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was sad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I said to myself, well,
just be happy for them right now and do
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever I can right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I came home.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a year ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was an email, $3.5 million given
to malnourished children in India,
[SPEAKER_09]: given to the ag and the nutrition human by
Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was just so exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the agricultural school is going to
find ways of growing more things for the
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our nutrition group is going to
provide better food for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was just so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went back to India again this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're expecting me to go next year,
but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for sharing that
story, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a real pleasure of ours to interact
with folks at CALS International Programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of the folks across CALS are not only
focused on communities here in New York,
[SPEAKER_07]: but across the US and around the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's, based on what I saw
in the NAS report, there's no evidence at
[SPEAKER_03]: all for the fact that it's genetically
modified being the causal agent of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, some of those public health
trends remain rather mysterious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have the Apple iPhone either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, there's a lot of things that
have changed in our society besides our
[SPEAKER_02]: food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that is our, we've become
more sedentary, which is not good for your
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've changed our eating habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to pinpoint specific
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have seen in the last 10 years is
increased consumption of produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the government has been trying to get
people to eat more produce because we feel
[SPEAKER_02]: it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making cause and effect connections is
very, very challenging in those kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: situations when you have populations that
we do, that's also changed and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: changing rapidly worldwide as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you'll find that the
percentages of people with Crohn's
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, for instance, has gone up,
but there's more people and more people
[SPEAKER_02]: are much more aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we hear a lot more about it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that is a big part as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our news cycle has changed tremendously to
a, you know, if it bleeds, it leads has
[SPEAKER_02]: changed into all aspects of the news that
we get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little challenging for us as
scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the scientific evidence has not
backed up some of the news that is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just add, so then it's,
there's, you know, it's probably a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an active and necessary area of
inquiry into kind of what are the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that sensitize us or kind of increase the
likelihood that someone will develop these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and trying to figure out what are,
what are those?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we avoid them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we minimize them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And thinking about just all the
complexity, like Courtney said about some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lifestyle things, there's a lot of
things that we've looked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals we interact with in our daily
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on food, there's also chemicals
that we're looking at to see which ones
[SPEAKER_00]: are we interacting with and which ones
might be triggers or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for different people, which,
and we're all different, we'll respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: things differently also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, looking at a vast spectrum
of a very complicated system and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: tease out, of course, how can we change
the things that might be triggers of such
[SPEAKER_00]: things to help, you know, in all the ways
that the food impacts us and our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment impacts us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and in addition to finding out
causes, we're also working on solutions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have folks across the college and in
human ecology as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nutritionists looking at how can
we help the folks that have been diagnosed
[SPEAKER_07]: with these issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have folks breeding specifically for
people that have gluten issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can we breed crops that can then be
used by our food science colleagues to
[SPEAKER_07]: produce gluten-free foods?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we absolutely are recognizing the
issues that exist and working towards
[SPEAKER_07]: scientific solutions for the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have, oh, is there one more?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have flash questions for the panel to
finish us up today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to ask the question about food
safety at farmer's markets, especially if
[SPEAKER_04]: you're buying foods that you're not going
to cook or heat treat.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the panel feel about food safety
on a farmer's market versus in a
[SPEAKER_04]: supermarket?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it turns out my wife is the national
leader in developing food safety programs
[SPEAKER_02]: for farmers and that extends from the
small plane farmers, Amish and Mennonite,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way to the multinational
corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is certainly a concern and it is,
Cornell is leading the way in developing
[SPEAKER_02]: programs for farmers to actually have a
plan on how to avoid contaminating their
[SPEAKER_02]: produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly it's in the news when there's an
outbreak in spinach or melons or
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits the news cycle instantaneously and
it scares people and it's with reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to find out that you've fed
your child something that's going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: them sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of that is the federal government
has actually come out with a new law.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it FISMA, the Food Safety
Modernization Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you probably don't know about it
and don't have to know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Cornell is part of that process of
getting rules and helping farmers put
[SPEAKER_02]: together plans so that they can be as safe
as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no such thing as no risk on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't eliminate it completely because
food is grown in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But farmers are very aware of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No farmer wants to make their customer
sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will destroy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're a lot more careful than
they were 10 years ago and they will
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to implement a lot of these
plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for most of the local stuff,
especially the thing that you can take
[SPEAKER_02]: some comfort in is most of these farmers
are eating their produce before they're
[SPEAKER_02]: selling it to you because they're feeding
their own families with it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly a concern though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's much less awkward for me to say
than Courtney, but Cornell takes an
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing sense of pride in our leadership
in good agricultural practices and food
[SPEAKER_07]: safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to Courtney's wife,
Betsy Bin, the entire Department of Food
[SPEAKER_07]: Science has just really led, I think,
the state, the country, and the world in
[SPEAKER_07]: good agricultural practices and safe food.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, the state of New York is really
leading the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our state partners have funded much of the
work and research as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a really revolutionary area for
Cornell and Kels both.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my flash questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering the timeframe in
terms of the enactment of that
[SPEAKER_10]: modernization act and how that's reaching
us in the marketplace because our food
[SPEAKER_10]: safety has dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question about the Food Safety
Modernization Act, that is being
[SPEAKER_02]: implemented as we speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have been training for the last
six, seven months now around the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing a lot of train the
trainers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that process, you train other people
who can then go out and train even more
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that process is ongoing as we
speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my wife, Betsy, has been traveling a
lot in the last six months all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've covered about 30 of the states
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those you'll notice around the
edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: The center part of the country in the
upper west doesn't grow a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they will get to all of the states by
the end of this year with trainings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the rules are coming into place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of them are for the larger
farms by the end of this year and then all
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole process by the end of next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a multi-year rollout of those.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming from other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an international section of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And international farms have to meet the
same standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are training people outside
the country as well who import food into
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States because they will have
to follow the same regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how closely are they monitored?
[SPEAKER_02]: Monitoring is always... What you'll find
is that we get a lot of produce from
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people worry about, oh, we're getting
this produce from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they do in Mexico that we don't
know about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out most of the companies growing in
Mexico are companies that are growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: California as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have an integrated food safety
plan throughout the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they do the exact same thing in
Mexico as they do in California or Arizona
[SPEAKER_02]: or somewhere else because they're putting
produce into the same stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Driscoll sells strawberries,
whether they come from California or
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida or Mexico, they want to have the
same standards everywhere because they
[SPEAKER_02]: can't afford not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have worked really hard and
spent a lot of money to get their name to
[SPEAKER_02]: be recognized as something of quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you'll see the same with
companies like Dole and some of these big
[SPEAKER_02]: produce companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very, very careful about their
reputation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a consumer, what are the top things
I should be looking for, thinking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think eating enough produce is probably
more important than worrying about where
[SPEAKER_02]: the produce comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most of us don't eat enough
produce.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been told that I need to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my last lightning questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: As scientists, when we give talks,
the last thing we always do is acknowledge
[SPEAKER_07]: the folks who have funded our work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was going to ask each of them,

[SPEAKER_07]: We're funded by industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have many industry partners that are
willing to help fund the work because it's
important.
