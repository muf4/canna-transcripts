[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you so much, Jeff,
for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really excited to be here with you all
today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like Jeff said, I'm Elizabeth McCarthy.
[SPEAKER_08]: My pronouns are she or hers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, my love affair with Nick Oceana,
Valentine's Day, we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: love of plants, started when I was an
undergrad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never want to leave it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took a little bit of a hiatus
occasionally, but not very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited to talk to you about how
polyploidy and hybridization affect flower
[SPEAKER_08]: evolution in these awesome species.
[SPEAKER_08]: There.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to start with an
introduction, and then I'm going to tell
[SPEAKER_08]: you two stories about flower color
evolution in polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: One on a young polyploid that's involving
homeolog bias and sub-gene abdominance,
[SPEAKER_08]: and one on some older polyploids that
involves transgressive delfinidin
[SPEAKER_08]: production.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm going to finish up with some
of the things that we're doing in the lab
[SPEAKER_08]: right now so you can see what my awesome
undergrads at SUNY Portland are doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So allopolyploidy involves two things,
both whole genome duplication and
[SPEAKER_08]: interspecific hybridization.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we can see up here, we have two
different diploid species.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are their sets of chromosomes,
different colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they come together to create hybrids
that have four sets of chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_08]: but two different diverged genomes back in
the same nucleus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this leads to this genomic shock,
where they have to figure out how to work
[SPEAKER_08]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this leads to all sorts of different
changes, but can also lead to changes in
[SPEAKER_08]: phenotype, like we can see in these
polyploids here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm interested in how these
phenomena lead to differences in flower
[SPEAKER_08]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Polyploidy is everywhere, especially in
land plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have ancient polyploidy at least in
all seed plants, another in all flowering
[SPEAKER_08]: plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we have so many genomes that
access that we have now, we can see that
[SPEAKER_08]: all of these red lineages are whole genome
duplications across land plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have ancient polyploidy everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the flower side of things, we know that
morphology and color is going to affect
[SPEAKER_08]: the type of pollinators that interact with
these flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here are just a subset of pollinators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see that the flowers that
they're visiting have different colors,
[SPEAKER_08]: different shapes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They open at different times.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could smell them, they would smell
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have this really exciting system
where we can look at differences not only
[SPEAKER_08]: in the plants, but see how they're
interacting with animal pollinators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to see this pathway a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the flavonoid biosynthetic
pathway, which is a branch pathway with
[SPEAKER_08]: many enzymes working together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the enzymes are emboldened by the
arrows.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they produce all of these different
types of pigments that lead to flower
[SPEAKER_08]: colors.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the bottom down here, we have our
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are colorful.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have red, pelargonadin, pinker magenta,
cyanidin, and purple delphinidin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then up here, we have flavonoid
flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are colorless to humans,
but they absorb UV.
[SPEAKER_08]: So differences in flavonols can give
differences in signals to pollinators that
[SPEAKER_08]: have UV receptors.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of them are important for the
formations of flower colors and how they
[SPEAKER_08]: interact with pollinators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have some understanding of
some transcription factors that are
[SPEAKER_08]: promoting the expression of some of these
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my overarching research questions in my
research program are, again, how does this
[SPEAKER_08]: genome merger that we get with
hybridization yield the novel and diverse
[SPEAKER_08]: phenotypes that we observe in
allopolyploids?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then how do those phenotypes affect
the evolution of allopolyploid species?
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nicosiana is a fantastic system to
study this in because we not only have an
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing diversity of flowers, size,
shape, color, but we also have a ton of
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're all different ages.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some that are young that have
not undergone speciation that are all less
[SPEAKER_08]: than a million years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another section that's about one
or one and a half million years old that
[SPEAKER_08]: has speciated into a few species.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another that is four million years old
that has speciated into a few more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran out of space on this slide.
[SPEAKER_08]: There is yet another one that is six
million years old that we think has maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: speciated into potentially 90 different
species.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a whole lot of stuff going on
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this really nice trajectory of
different age polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can ask questions about the
differences between what's happening short
[SPEAKER_08]: term and long term consequences of
allopolyploids as they evolve.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, the stories I'm going to tell you
are involving Nicosiana tobacum,
[SPEAKER_08]: this young polyploid, and section repande,
this older one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to get a flavor of a couple
of these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that first story I'm going to tell you
about is about Nicosiana tobacum and
[SPEAKER_08]: homilag bias and sub-gene of dominance and
how it affects flower color.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nicosiana tobacum is the product of
Nicosiana sylvester maternal progenitor
[SPEAKER_08]: and Nicosiana tomatosa formis paternal
progenitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have these natural polyploids,
like I showed you already, that are 0.6
[SPEAKER_08]: million years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have some different accessions that
have some variation in flower color.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have these really bright magenta ones
and some light pink ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also have synthetic polyploids that
we have created.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other folks have created in the lab where
we have first generation polyploids so we
[SPEAKER_08]: can get an idea of what's happening
immediately following polyploidy to then
[SPEAKER_08]: compare that to what's happening over
evolution in our natural ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, again, even in our synthetic
lines, see some variation in flower color.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have light pink ones and we have
darker pink ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a great system that we can
compare.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, webinar biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: The differences we see in these pinks is
mainly due to differences in cyanidin
[SPEAKER_08]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the focus we're going to think
about for this story, at least.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're also going to think about
homilag expression bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we have allopolyplades,
we have homilags, two different progenitor
[SPEAKER_08]: copies inside our genome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for example, DFR, which is one of
our genes in our pathway, will have a
[SPEAKER_08]: maternal copy and a paternal copy here in
purple and teal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can have either equal homilag
expression, where there's equal expression
[SPEAKER_08]: from both of these copies, or we could
have unequal expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we call that homilag expression
bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for example, down here, we have more
copies, or more transcripts of our
[SPEAKER_08]: paternal copy than our maternal copy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be an expression bias
towards the paternal over the maternal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the talk, I'm going to be reporting
that homilag expression bias as the
[SPEAKER_08]: percent of our maternal homilag that is
present, so the proportion of Sylvester in
[SPEAKER_08]: these polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's at the gene level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're thinking about how are the two
progenitor copies, and what's the ratio of
[SPEAKER_08]: our two progenitor copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we build that up to the whole
transcriptome level, we can see whether we
[SPEAKER_08]: have a skew in the bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have more Sylvester's bias genes
than Tomatosa formus bias genes,
[SPEAKER_08]: or do we have an equal number of each?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we do have a bias, we call that
subgenome dominance, where one progenitor
[SPEAKER_08]: genome has more expression overall than
the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my questions for this story are,
what's the genetic basis of the pigment
[SPEAKER_08]: and flower color differences that we
observe in these tobacco aloe polyploids?
[SPEAKER_08]: And do those correlate with homilag bias
differences in the polyploids?
[SPEAKER_08]: So do we see that these flower color
differences are associated with homilag
[SPEAKER_08]: bias differences?
[SPEAKER_08]: So to answer this question, this is part
of my postdoc work with Amy Litt at UC
[SPEAKER_08]: Riverside.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did a developmental series for all of
our different accessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we collected corolla tissue from early
buds, mid buds, and late floral buds
[SPEAKER_08]: across all of our progenitors,
our natural polyploids, and our synthetic
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this work was done by two undergrads,
Amber LaHorn and Amelda Curti at UC
[SPEAKER_08]: Riverside with me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did a transcriptome analysis from
these accessions with an Illumina platform
[SPEAKER_08]: and a 1 by 85 reads.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used a de novo assembly approach to
analyze that data.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we found that these short reads made
it really difficult to distinguish between
[SPEAKER_08]: our two progenitor copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so when I got here, y'all might
recognize him, Jacob Landis.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see his face a couple times.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in collaboration with Jacob,
we added some long-read Oxford Nanopore
[SPEAKER_08]: sequencing to our progenitors to be able
to increase the quality of our assemblies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We made those diploid assemblies,
put them together in silico to create our
[SPEAKER_08]: allopolyploid assembly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that long-read data, we were able
to distinguish between our two copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are looking at our different
biosynthetic pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you you were going to see this
pathway a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've color-coded it so we can have an idea
of where the different genes are.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the colors in the pathway are related
to the colors in our points.
[SPEAKER_08]: The points on these graphs are our
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: The violin plots behind them are the
transcriptome overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this graph, we're looking at
differentially expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on our x-axis, we have our different
pairwise comparisons.
[SPEAKER_08]: So between our progenitors, between our
polyploids and our two different
[SPEAKER_08]: progenitors, and among our different
polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on our y-axis, we have our log
two-fold change of our differentially
[SPEAKER_08]: expressed genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing to notice is that our
bold-colored points are our
[SPEAKER_08]: tomatoseiformis homologs, and our
transparent points are our silvestris
[SPEAKER_08]: homologs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we look, and this is in our early
development, so our early bud,
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we look at our comparison between our
progenitors, we see that most of our genes
[SPEAKER_08]: are differentially expressed, just what we
want to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our silvestris homologs are upregulated
in silvestris.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our tomatoseiformis homologs are
upregulated in tomatoseiformis.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we compare our baccums, our
polyploids, to our maternal progenitor,
[SPEAKER_08]: unsurprisingly, we see that our paternal
homologs are upregulated in the polyploids
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to the maternal progenitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also see that we have some maternal
homologs that are upregulated in the
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids compared to their progenitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly, when we compare to our paternal
progenitor, we again see that the maternal
[SPEAKER_08]: copies are upregulated in our polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this case, when we think about the
paternal homologs, they tend to be more
[SPEAKER_08]: highly expressed in the progenitor
compared to the polyploid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when we compare among our
different types of polyploids,
[SPEAKER_08]: we are starting to really tease out
differences that might be involved in the
[SPEAKER_08]: differences in flower color we see.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we look at comparisons between light
pink and magenta flowers, we're starting
[SPEAKER_08]: to see genes that are involved in
producing at the cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: The black pig points here are at FLS gene,
which gives us towards flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see differences among our
accessions here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're starting to get some of these
pieces that might be important in creating
[SPEAKER_08]: these differences in flower phenotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we looked at that a little further.
[SPEAKER_08]: We took these different comparisons where
we had light pink and dark pink polyploids
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we saw whether there were any commonly
differentially expressed genes to those
[SPEAKER_08]: comparisons.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we found a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least two comparisons had an
upregulation of DFR, which is,
[SPEAKER_08]: again, this one that is the first gene
towards making at the cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was upregulated in the dark pink
phenotype, whereas FLS, which is towards
[SPEAKER_08]: making flavonols, is upregulated in our
light pink things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had a handful of other genes
that were singletons.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, they seem to be concentrated in
the genes that are producing at the
[SPEAKER_08]: cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're upregulated in our dark pink
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or flavonols are at the beginning of our
pathway for our light pink phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me take a step back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're asking this question about,
do changes in homolog bias in these genes
[SPEAKER_08]: correlate with the differences in flower
color that we observe?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for these spots, on our x-axis,
we have our developmental time points.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are our early, mid, and late
tissues.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're looking at our percent
silvestris.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's our homolog bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it's 0.5, that's equal.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's above 0.5, that's silvestris
biased.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's below 0.5, that's tomatosa formis
biased.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our silvestris and tomatosa formis are
behaving excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this case, in FLS, we see that we
have pretty equal expression between our
[SPEAKER_08]: two progenitors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that seems to be the case for all of
the accessions that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did see some differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did see some differences in homolog
expression bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they did not correlate with phenotype,
like we hypothesized.
[SPEAKER_08]: They instead correlated with the polyploid
age.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our synthetic polyploids, which are
here in these pink and purple points,
[SPEAKER_08]: tended to be more equally expressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas our natural polyploids,
here in cyan and orange, are further away
[SPEAKER_08]: from that equal expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are more biased.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we saw that both in CHI, at the
beginning of the pathway, and in DFR,
[SPEAKER_08]: towards making epicyanids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we found this overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that natural polyploids tended to
display a stronger homolog bias,
[SPEAKER_08]: more different than equal, both in our
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes that
[SPEAKER_08]: we can see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have an increased distance from
equal in our natural polyploids compared
[SPEAKER_08]: to our synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that also held across the entire
transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're seeing we have stronger bias in
our natural polyploids compared to our
[SPEAKER_08]: synthetic polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now we can ask this question.
[SPEAKER_08]: We looked at individual genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about overall?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we see subgenome dominance where we
have more Sylvester's bias or more
[SPEAKER_08]: Tomatosa formus bias genes than the other?
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this plot, we have our progenitor
ratio on the x-axis and our polyploid
[SPEAKER_08]: homolog ratio on our y-axis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a lot of points in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I also put these histogram curves along
the sides to give us an idea of the
[SPEAKER_08]: distribution of those points.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can see that our progenitor ratios
and most of the ratios of our polyploids
[SPEAKER_08]: are pretty balanced.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a relatively symmetrical curve
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we see this pink one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have this line that is a little bit
higher on one side than the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: So QM24 seems to have a little bit of a
bias towards Sylvester's biased homologs
[SPEAKER_08]: over Tomatosa formus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we look at their floral phenotypes,
here's QM24.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here are the two parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that QM24 shares some things
with Sylvester's that may be a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: further away from Tomatosa formus.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a paler color.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a smaller tube opening.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more star-shaped.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so maybe that is reflected in the
morphology that we observe.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so to really answer that question of
whether we have subgenome dominance,
[SPEAKER_08]: what I did is I partitioned or grouped
these genes into either a Sylvester's bias
[SPEAKER_08]: group or a Tomatosa formus bias group,
and then did a chi-square test to see
[SPEAKER_08]: whether we had a skew in where those genes
fell.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we did this in several different
thresholds.
[SPEAKER_08]: So first, naively, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just split it down the middle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it was bigger than 50%,
I put it in Sylvester's bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was smaller than 50%, I put it in
Tomatosa formus bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that gives us no equal expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we created this buffer zone where
we have equal expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a threshold where it was
considered Sylvester's bias if it was 55%
[SPEAKER_08]: or above, and Tomatosa formus bias if it
was 45% or below, and then also another
[SPEAKER_08]: threshold where it was 60% versus less
than 40%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody feeling good about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell that I have an undergrad
person?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we took the numbers that are
falling in those categories to do the
[SPEAKER_08]: chi-square test to see if we actually had
subgenome dominance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we found, so here on our x-axis,
we have our progenitors.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our different polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on our y-axis, we have bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our dotted line in the middle is no
bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: And above the line is a Tomatosa formus
bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: And below the line is a Sylvester's bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we see is that we have a slight
bias across the genome toward Tomatosa
[SPEAKER_08]: formus in our progenitor ratio,
a slight bias towards Sylvester's in QM24
[SPEAKER_08]: like we saw in our other plot,
but no bias in QM25 or our natural
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of subgenome dominance
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But not a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, but that's the whole genome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's look at our flavono biosynthetic
pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've seen this type of graph before.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have our progenitor ratio on the
x-axis, our polyploid homolog ratio on our
[SPEAKER_08]: y-axis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The gray points are across the genome,
our transcriptome, excuse me, like we saw
[SPEAKER_08]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we're highlighting where our
flavono biosynthetic pathway genes are
[SPEAKER_08]: falling out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, they're color coded based on our
pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we can see is that, especially in
our progenitor ratio, we have a huge bias
[SPEAKER_08]: towards Tomatosa formus.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have one in our polyploids,
but it seems to be a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's look at that in a slightly
easier way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can see that our bias has shifted a lot
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a huge bias towards Tomatosa
formus in our progenitors, in our flavono
[SPEAKER_08]: biosynthetic pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is still present, but greatly
reduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: In our polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still see this Tomatosa formus bias,
but it is way less present.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly our synthetic polyploids are
unbiased.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do see that Sylvesterous,
the whole genome of Sylvesterous is
[SPEAKER_08]: playing a role in determining the flower
color of these polyploids, since we have
[SPEAKER_08]: that reduction in the bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even though Sylvesterous does not make
pink colors, it is involved in making
[SPEAKER_08]: pink.
[SPEAKER_08]: Its genome is involved in making pink
colors in polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So both of these genomes are working
together to create our differences that we
[SPEAKER_08]: see in polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, with these plots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a new thing that we can think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where things fall in these plots gives us
an idea of their regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if things fall out in this horizontal
line, then they are likely transregulated,
[SPEAKER_08]: because they're in the same environment,
and so they're going to have equal
[SPEAKER_08]: expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our diagonal line represents our
cis-regulatory differences, because those
[SPEAKER_08]: cis-regulatory differences should track
with what we see in the progenitors to
[SPEAKER_08]: what we see in the polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Giving us that diagonal line.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then anywhere else in the plot is
likely some sort of cis-trans interaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we can see from this,
again we have our flavonoid biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_08]: pathway genes pulled out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here they're color coded by gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here they're color coded by our accession.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, our pink and our purple are our
synthetic ones, and our cyan and our
[SPEAKER_08]: orange are the natural ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we see is that often when we see
differences, the synthetic polyploids seem
[SPEAKER_08]: to have more equal expression,
and then our natural polyploids have more
[SPEAKER_08]: deviation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this seems to suggest that our
natural polyploids are evolving
[SPEAKER_08]: cis-regulatory differences and
cis-regulatory changes as they're aging
[SPEAKER_08]: based on what we're seeing in the
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were looking at the sequences of
these genes, we also found that a few of
[SPEAKER_08]: our tobacconic sessions had a frameshift
mutation in DFR, which again is that first
[SPEAKER_08]: gene TOR is making at the cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a one base for adulation
leading to this frameshift.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other folks found this also and did some
functional work on it, and they found that
[SPEAKER_08]: that frameshift led to a non-functional
gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we have the frameshift and we
bombard those constructs into a white
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco mutant, the gene that doesn't have
a frameshift is able to create at the
[SPEAKER_08]: cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that in this cell.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's our control because our YFP is
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that our constructs are in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we have a frameshift,
again, we know this cell has that
[SPEAKER_08]: construct, but it can't produce any at the
cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we know that this frameshift is
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we seem to see that this DFR homolog in
the Sylvester's copy might be becoming a
[SPEAKER_08]: pseudogene, even in young polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, because of this, we know it's
non-functional.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not include that transcript in our
overall transcript analyses, which I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: going to show you next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we found that our homolog bias did
not correlate with flower color,
[SPEAKER_08]: but when we pool our pomegranate
expression together, we do see that
[SPEAKER_08]: overall expression of these genes does
correlate with flower color.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've heard about FLS, which is making
flavonols, and DFR, which is making at the
[SPEAKER_08]: cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at those expression of those
genes across development in these plots.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we can also look at the ratio here,
because they're competing for the same
[SPEAKER_08]: substrates in the pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what we noticed when we looked at
that ratio is that we have an elevated FLS
[SPEAKER_08]: to DFR ratio early on in development in
our two polyploids that have a light pink
[SPEAKER_08]: phenotype, which you can see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we think that that is driving the
flux of the pathway towards making
[SPEAKER_08]: flavonols at the expense of making at the
cyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also seems to be because DFR isn't
expressed as much early in development.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being turned on later, and it's
giving us that elevated FLS to DFR ratio.
[SPEAKER_08]: But because we have this competition,
having more FLS means that we're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: have more of our pathway going towards
making flavonols, less going towards at
[SPEAKER_08]: the cyanins, giving us that light pink
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also looked at the sequence variation
in this gene.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is work that has been done by
Abigail McCoy, who just graduated last
[SPEAKER_08]: semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: She worked with me for seven semesters at
Cortland, and she was doing another
[SPEAKER_08]: project that I'll tell you a little bit
about at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what we could see from that is that we
do have some variation, especially in
[SPEAKER_08]: regions that are important in which
substrates this gene is interacting with,
[SPEAKER_08]: because it works on several different
ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so sequence variation may also affect
how these enzymes are functioning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it seems like there's both a
transcription and expression story to this
[SPEAKER_08]: story and potentially a sequence evolution
story to this story.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so conclude on this story.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found that homilogue bias does not
correlate with the differences in flower
[SPEAKER_08]: color that we observe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do see that we have a stronger
homilogue bias in our natural polyploids
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to our synthetic ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a slight subgenome dominance in
TM24, but not the others.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a reduction of tomentosiformis
bias in our flavonoid biosynthetic pathway
[SPEAKER_08]: genes and polyploids compared to their
progenitors.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that transregulatory differences are
important early on in polyploid evolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: But perhaps our natural polyploids are
evolving more cisregulatory differences as
[SPEAKER_08]: they age.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got this potential pseudogene
popping up, and that our high FLS to DFR
[SPEAKER_08]: ratio is potentially driving our late pig
flower phenotype.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that our pigments that we see that are
different across these species probably do
[SPEAKER_08]: both to transcript levels and also the
efficiency of these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's shift gears.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to talk about transgressive
delphinidin in these older polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here's Nicosiana, section rapenda.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen Sylvester before.
[SPEAKER_08]: She gets around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then up to Syphilia is our paternal
parent here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a single event that happened 4
million years ago that has speciated into
[SPEAKER_08]: a few different polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also see, again, flavonoids we're
going to talk about our pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is going to be a flavonil,
so camphorol and coercitin, and a
[SPEAKER_08]: delphinidin story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can see these purple
arrowheads here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nudacollis and rapenda have delphinidin,
the purple pigment.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Sylvester's and obtusifolia don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a transgressive character
because it is outside the range that we
[SPEAKER_08]: see in the progenitors, which just makes
me really excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I love polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have that transgressive delphinidin,
which is here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have transgressive levels of
camphorol in two of our species,
[SPEAKER_08]: rapenda and stocktonii, compared to our
parents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I didn't convince you before,
even though these look white, we do have
[SPEAKER_08]: that delphinidin in the tubes of these two
flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so my questions here are, is this
delphinidin coming because of differences
[SPEAKER_08]: in sequence evolution, in differential
expression?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or a combination of both?
[SPEAKER_08]: And if sequence evolution is important,
then is it because we have complementation
[SPEAKER_08]: from our progenitors, where coming
together in the same genome means that
[SPEAKER_08]: they can then produce that pigment they
couldn't before?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or has there been some sort of
resurrection of function during polyploid
[SPEAKER_08]: evolution?
[SPEAKER_08]: Told you you'd see his face again.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did another transcriptome analysis,
again with early, mid, and late floral
[SPEAKER_08]: buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: This time, we had a little bit of better
alumina, 2 by 150 reads that did allow us
[SPEAKER_08]: to do a de novo assembly for our two
progenitors, which we again combined into
[SPEAKER_08]: our allopolyploid transcriptome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Abby, who you've seen before,
also mapped these to a specific,
[SPEAKER_08]: just the reads of known flavonoid
biosynthetic pathway genes so we can pull
[SPEAKER_08]: out the sequences of these genes to look
at whether they're functional or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we found that they tend to not have any
nonsense or frameshift mutations.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no stop codons or frameshifts in
any of our genes in the goccianus
[SPEAKER_08]: solvesteris, the maternal progenitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We did find that obtusifolia has some,
either two or three, premature stop codons
[SPEAKER_08]: in ANS, which is our last enzyme in our
torus-making anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we went and looked at our homilog
copies of obtusifolia, and our polyplades,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we didn't see those stop codons.
[SPEAKER_08]: We looked at another younger polyplade
that also has obtusifolia as a parent,
[SPEAKER_08]: and its obtusifolia homilog also doesn't
have these stop codons.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that makes me think that these probably
arose in the lineage after it created the
[SPEAKER_08]: polyplades.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not really playing a role in the
polyplades, but maybe it's playing a role
[SPEAKER_08]: in why obtusifolia cannot make any
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: So because of a different project,
one of my undergrads, who also has
[SPEAKER_08]: graduated, Trinity Tobin, found that the
ANS copy of Nicocyanus solvesteris retains
[SPEAKER_08]: an intron in its transcripts.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we have some gels.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's our genomic DNA from solvesteris.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's cDNA from another diploid.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can see that we can definitely get
differentiation, where we have with an
[SPEAKER_08]: intron, without an intron.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the cDNA from solvesteris,
we tend to have both.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some transcripts that have the
intron, some that don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this also changes over time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So early on in development, we have more
transcripts that retain this intron,
[SPEAKER_08]: and less that don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not DNA contamination.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we do those same samples in a different
gene, we can see that we only have
[SPEAKER_08]: transcripts without the intron in our cDNA
samples.
[SPEAKER_08]: So something is going on here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We looked at the sequence.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you leave that intron in,
you get a stop codon pretty much right
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So likely, these transcripts with the
intron in are nonfunctional.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this potentially is playing a role
in the lack of anthocyanins in the
[SPEAKER_08]: maternal progenitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to look into more about
this, because it's just like, what is
[SPEAKER_08]: happening here?
[SPEAKER_08]: If we look at our overall expression of
our flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes
[SPEAKER_08]: in our polyploids, we see good
correlation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our transgressive flavonols,
those two that have higher flavonols,
[SPEAKER_08]: they have higher expression of FLS,
which is towards making anthocyanins,
[SPEAKER_08]: and two of these genes that are early on
in the pathway, which are going to give
[SPEAKER_08]: more flux through the pathway overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're increasing the amount of
pigments that are produced.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also see really nice correlation
between increased expression of
[SPEAKER_08]: anthocyanin-based genes, so at the bottom
of the pathway, or the transcription
[SPEAKER_08]: factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks like we have really good
correlation between the transcript
[SPEAKER_08]: differences and our pigment differences in
this story, which we can see here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we look, and apologies for the
quality of these graphs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what happened there.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we look at DFR transcripts and
correlate it to delfinidin, we have a
[SPEAKER_08]: really nice correlation, similar to F3
prime 5 prime H.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which brings the pathway to our delfinidin
branch.
[SPEAKER_08]: We see that there's an increase in
delfinidin with an increase in transcript
[SPEAKER_08]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Similar with FLS.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have an increase in FLS,
we have an increase in flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also looked at the ratio
between FLS, which brings us towards
[SPEAKER_08]: flavonols, and F3 prime H, which is going
to differentiate towards whether we're
[SPEAKER_08]: making camphorol or coercitin flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see a correlation between that FLS
to F3 prime H's ratio and our camphorol to
[SPEAKER_08]: coercitin ratio.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're seeing really good correlation
between what we are expressing and what
[SPEAKER_08]: pigments we are producing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to conclude this story, our ANS gene in
both of our diploid progenitors may be
[SPEAKER_08]: nonfunctional or have reduced function,
which may explain why they don't make
[SPEAKER_08]: anthocyanins, but it seems like those
mutations happened later after they
[SPEAKER_08]: produced our polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not telling us why our polyploids
can produce or influencing why our
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids can or cannot produce
flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have increased expression of early
and FLS genes correlating with increased
[SPEAKER_08]: flavonol production and increased
expression of anthocyanin-based genes
[SPEAKER_08]: correlating with the transgressive
delfinidin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it seems like this story is an
expression difference story and less so a
[SPEAKER_08]: sequence evolution story.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little bit of time, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to highlight a few things that
are going on with the students that either
[SPEAKER_08]: have just graduated or are still working
in my lab, because I get really excited
[SPEAKER_08]: about the work that my undergrads,
excuse me, undergrads that work with me
[SPEAKER_08]: do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Lane Jensen graduated a little bit ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're actually doing a PhD at the
University of Buffalo now.
[SPEAKER_08]: They worked on evolutionary simulations of
the biosynthetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_08]: We modified simulations by Wheeler at
Smith and changed it so that we could
[SPEAKER_08]: evolve towards having multiple optima to
reflect the pigment data we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we can ask questions about what are
the mutations that are necessary for
[SPEAKER_08]: flower color shifts to happen?
[SPEAKER_08]: And are some shifts harder to evolve to
than others?
[SPEAKER_08]: You've seen Abby's face before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Abby was working on a weather positive
selection is connected with floral
[SPEAKER_08]: pigment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so she used GNDES ratio analyses to
investigate whether we see differences
[SPEAKER_08]: between anthocyanins and no anthocyanin
producing species and also cyanidin versus
[SPEAKER_08]: delfinidin producing species.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Trinity was working on this other
project that then led to us figuring out
[SPEAKER_08]: that we had that intron retained in ANS.
[SPEAKER_08]: She was looking to develop a droplet
digital PCR protocol such that we could
[SPEAKER_08]: distinguish between expression of our two
homeologs in a single reaction.
[SPEAKER_08]: So more bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_08]: We made some progress.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, it didn't really come to
pass that it was going to be feasible for
[SPEAKER_08]: what we're doing, but we still learned
some really cool stuff along the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've kind of shifted that project with
some new folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to move this so we can see
Melissa's name.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some new folks who are using DDPCR,
but now we're developing two different
[SPEAKER_08]: primers to still get the expression data
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reactions this time, but Alyssa Perino and
Brooke Tillerton are working on this
[SPEAKER_08]: project and we're getting into a
different, we're taking those one million
[SPEAKER_08]: euro polyploids and seeing what's
happening with homeolog bias in them.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another set of folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Edie Rousseau has been working with me for
about a year and a half looking at how
[SPEAKER_08]: cellular dynamics changing over time
development are affecting the flower sizes
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have in polyplanes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tim McGrath just joined the lab this
semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're excited to see what they're going
to come up with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally, I got a grant to go to
Kew Gardens in the summer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So full circle, Jeff talked about how
that's how my story started.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to get excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to take one of my undergrads to the
place where I started my undergrad love of
[SPEAKER_08]: Nikoshauna.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Marissa McLean and I went and collected
a flower morphology photographic data set
[SPEAKER_08]: of a lot of these really old polyploids
that have exploded.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're actually right now, they did it
yesterday and this week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did it last semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: My intro bio lab students are measuring
tube length and width from the photographs
[SPEAKER_08]: we brought back, which is super fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a great time with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Kendra Moscato joined the lab
this semester.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're excited to see where we're
going to take that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Project.
[SPEAKER_08]: So lots of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to acknowledge a ton of people
who have made this Nikoshauna journey
[SPEAKER_08]: possible, including my PhD and postdoc
supervisors, collaborators from all of
[SPEAKER_08]: those places, and especially my
undergraduates, because mentoring them is
[SPEAKER_08]: really valuable and really exciting for
me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited to see where they go and
what they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, some funding sources and
computational resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll happily answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions for Elizabeth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how I can
make it pop up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I can get some technical assistance
on the Zoom while I answer Rob's question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_08]: We made it disappear and then put it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was quite a tour de force.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I get excited and talk real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a nice lineage for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bi geographically, you have a lot of
repeated evolution and loss of night
[SPEAKER_03]: blooming and color versus white and scent,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Silvestris is a major player in
everything you've shown us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I remember correctly, Silvestris is a
problem phylogenetically that's off on a
[SPEAKER_03]: limb on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the clonistics are misleading because
of the hybrids that it makes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like it's closely related to
things that it's actually the progenitor
[SPEAKER_03]: of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what can be for Silvestris thinking
about the stop codons and why it's white?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the stop codons are in obtuse folia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the introns that seems to be right.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, so let's take a step back
further than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the ancestral condition to be white and
scented or is it to be colored?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I knew the answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the Nicotiana or the Nicotiana
sections are connected, it means that we
[SPEAKER_08]: have a bifurcation at the base.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that could be white or colored pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we do see a lot of shifts in
whether things are colored or white in the
[SPEAKER_08]: genus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess let me follow that with a kind of
Stacey Smith question.
[SPEAKER_03]: When is white not white?
[SPEAKER_03]: So many of us thought about white as null
mutants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you were showing us the
flavonols can give you white flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very strongly pigmented and
they're antifungal, but they're not nulls.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you looked at the tree for the
genus, do you think there are many
[SPEAKER_03]: different sources of whiteness?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So something I didn't talk about today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Sylvesterous and many of these do
have flavonols and they absorb UV instead
[SPEAKER_08]: of reflecting UV.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aptusifolia does not have very many
flavonols and it reflects UV.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even within our white flowers,
we have phenotypic differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't managed to do those things with
every single, it's my goal to do this with
[SPEAKER_08]: every single species of Nicotiana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally not feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Australian ones that you did with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those have a single origin and they
radiate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they should all have the same
whiteness.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least in terms of UV absorption and
reflection, we were able to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought my spec with me to London.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those all seem to absorb flavonols,
or excuse me, absorb UV.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't done any pigment data on them
yet, but hopefully soon, at least a
[SPEAKER_08]: handful.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in terms of the ones that do absorb UV
and produce flavonols,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those are probably the same white.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then we have some that have a ton of
flavonols and some that don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like the two polyploids that have that
really high levels of flavonols,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that a different phenotype?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess, again, my answer to your
question is I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're really interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you calculate the age of these?
[SPEAKER_05]: The 6.5 million, it would put you in the
myosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was not data.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did, but they used molecular data and
some sort of nonparametric test,
[SPEAKER_08]: if I'm remembering correctly, to estimate
times.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have any within Nicotiana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Off the top of my head, I don't have this
specifics, but it's definitely earlier
[SPEAKER_06]: than Solanaceae.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Solanaceae, but I don't have a
good, I'm doing great on questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, is the answer to your
question also, but definitely a good
[SPEAKER_08]: point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we don't have specifics,
like maybe our exact dates aren't great,
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think our relative dates are
certainly good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if we don't have the exact dates,
we still have that trajectory of
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding which ones are younger and
which ones are older.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that still kind of fits with my,
I wish we had more fossils, is again the
[SPEAKER_08]: answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a hand over here and then you're on
deck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a naive question.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these pigments that you've talked
about appear in vegetative organs as well
[SPEAKER_05]: as floral organs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a fair supposition that what you
found in the petals is also happening in
[SPEAKER_05]: the vegetative organs?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think yes and no.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the flavonols, I would assume yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's way more likely that those
vegetative tissues have flavonols compared
[SPEAKER_08]: to the anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just by looking at the vegetative tissue
in some of these plants as I've worked
[SPEAKER_08]: with them, there are some that I call
them, they have purple leaves.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are like, no, that's green.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, yes, but it's purpler than these
ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that maybe some of them have
some anthocyanins in them, but I would
[SPEAKER_08]: certainly guess flavonols.
[SPEAKER_08]: The levels and the ratios, of those
things, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But even within the flower tissue,
can I find that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even in the flower tissue, we have
differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the pigments are really concentrated in
the limb and not in the tube.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do think that for the anthocyanins at
least, we have really specific expression
[SPEAKER_08]: of when we're turning those pigments on,
which is probably not happening in the
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetative.
[SPEAKER_08]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see sub-genome dominance in the
older natural polyploids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is sub-genome dominant?
[SPEAKER_08]: We see a more expression bias.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the gene by gene basis, we see a
greater deviation from equal expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we look at it overall, we don't
actually see sub-genome dominance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a function of the age of the
polyploid?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could look at that gradient of the
ages of those polyploid events,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you see with older polyploid events,
more of that bias?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's part of like, I'm trying to piece
this together.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working in all these different age
polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, at some point, I'm going to
be able to put all of that together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess a follow up to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a logical conclusion of that
sub-genome dominance and maybe a
[SPEAKER_04]: contraction that you see?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we don't have full genomes of all
of these polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the sequences that people have
used phylogenetically, we do seem to have
[SPEAKER_08]: both copies of things in most of these
polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the oldest ones were starting to
lose some things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe that's when fractionation is
starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't have a good answer to that
yet either.
[SPEAKER_08]: But definitely a great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of fits with this idea of how can
we use this trajectory to really answer
[SPEAKER_08]: cool questions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about flower size and shape?
[SPEAKER_08]: What about it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I also care about those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff that's playing out in
interesting ways, I guess I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and we're trying to get at that in
some of the things that Edie and Tim are
[SPEAKER_08]: working on with the cell stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the Suave Lentes project,
we have more differences in shape and size
[SPEAKER_08]: than color in those.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are things that we're getting
into that, again, I don't have a good
[SPEAKER_08]: answer to your questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would love to find out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I can tell you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do see that we tend to have wider tubes
in really young polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that seems to be because the width of
the cells are bigger with polyploidy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So polyploidy increases the width of the
cells and increases the tube, which might
[SPEAKER_08]: influence pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe polyploidy potentially is giving
us more generalized pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what Edie and Tim are looking at is
the cell size in the older polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And preliminary data, it looks like we
lose that in our older ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're reducing the size in our older
polyploids, potentially like we're
[SPEAKER_08]: reducing genome size.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to find out more about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff and then Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the link with pollinators with
sizes and the pigments?
[SPEAKER_07]: The amount of flavonoids for reflection
for bees seeing bees versus bats not
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing bees.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the correlation?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some pollinator data.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have pollinator data more for diploids
than we do for polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's another whole trajectory that I
would love to take my research program in
[SPEAKER_08]: the future, is to look and see how these
morphological and phenotypic differences
[SPEAKER_08]: affect pollinators.
[SPEAKER_08]: But unfortunately, we don't know a whole
lot about what's pollinating our
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I don't know the answer to that
question, but that's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so much to work on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: To get back to Adrien's question,
you also have a symmetry issue,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like tomatosepholia and butyphora are
zygomorphic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know what genes are responsible in a
lot of my families for zygomorphy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they segregating between the hybrids?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Sylvester's does not look
zygomorphic to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Sylvester's does not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that most Nicosia are not.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a handful.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the Allate are also zygomorphic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to just think about all the
polyploids in my head for a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think most of them are radial,
at least in the limb.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some in the older polyploids
that we are just investigating where they
[SPEAKER_08]: do start to have those.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, really great questions that we
can investigate.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know those genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully with more data, we can again
start answering those questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really great ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I suggest a question, too,
because certain kinds of pollinators like
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers that have an up and down?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cell size question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be cool with more data to see if
there's a relationship between polyploid
[SPEAKER_04]: and endo.
[SPEAKER_04]: If in these polyploids that maybe you see
less or if it's compensating or they're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get their genomes one way or
another.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, really cool things that hopefully
be able to investigate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, there's so many cool things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions, folks?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you made your own de novo
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you able to see any bias when you
took that same data?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming you did a concatenated
transcriptome in the mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were there any reads that maps to one
or the other in current age?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and that's part of why I didn't tell
you a story about homilag bias in Ropande.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have, I need two hands for
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need two hands for everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a threshold for when we're looking
at those homilag bias where we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: have a less than 10% mismatch between our
two copies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for many genes, we reached that.
[SPEAKER_08]: For some, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily for the tobacco story,
we reached that for all of our flavonoid
[SPEAKER_08]: biosynthetic pathway genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't hit that for Ropande,
which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hoping maybe, and maybe Jacob has a
better answer to this question,
[SPEAKER_08]: if we add more long reads to those
progenitors, we didn't have that for this
[SPEAKER_08]: one, whether we might be able to pull out
the differences.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have the added difficulty of
there's four million years of evolution in
[SPEAKER_08]: the polyploids and in the diploid lineages
in that system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so being able to really figure out
homilogs because the homilogs within the
[SPEAKER_08]: polyploids have diverged in sequence from
the progenitors.
[SPEAKER_08]: We see that way less in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's way easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we just can't ask those kinds of
questions for those genes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions, folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I do one real quick?
[SPEAKER_08]: One real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep thinking about this in the long
term one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this 90 species or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking about copy number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you get retention of homilogs over
time and how that might lead to either sub
[SPEAKER_01]: or neofunctionalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you see how you might attract that
across those different time scales?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it'll probably have to be on a
candidate gene basis, more likely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least, like I said before,
folks have used some genes to look at
[SPEAKER_08]: phylogenetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we sometimes don't see the second
copy.
[SPEAKER_08]: In some of those swabilentes, the old
ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's certainly interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're already seeing some
pseudogenation in young polyploids
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't talk about it today.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we looked at all of those
flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes in
[SPEAKER_08]: the rapende, there are a few more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the homilogs within the polyploids
have frame shifts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're starting to see some of those
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, again, all of you have really
great ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are really good questions that,
with more data, will definitely be
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting to investigate.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's thank Lizzie.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
