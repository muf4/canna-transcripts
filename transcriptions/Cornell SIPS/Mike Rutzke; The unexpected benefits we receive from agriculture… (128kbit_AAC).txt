[SPEAKER_07]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I learned about having goats,
they give you plenty of opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about things to talk about in a
seminar that's entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk to you a little bit
about the personal and the societal
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about growing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody here is familiar with growing
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk to you about some of my
personal experiences and our family's
[SPEAKER_00]: personal experiences on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk a little about the
historical parts, how other cultures treat
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, our natural resources,
our family, a little bit on nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to close off with the
effects that I felt from climate change on
[SPEAKER_00]: our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the spectroscopy areas that we
need to consider for adaptation practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now how do I start?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a blank slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I need to... There's a video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine the Earth as an apple.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it were sliced into four pieces,
three pieces would represent the Earth's
[SPEAKER_07]: bodies of water.
[SPEAKER_07]: One piece would represent land.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the remaining piece were sliced in half
again, one piece would represent the land
[SPEAKER_07]: on Earth that is unsuitable or
inhospitable for farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: This leaves one eighth of the apple
representing land that is used to live on
[SPEAKER_07]: and grow food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three quarters of the remaining apple
slice would represent soils too poor to
[SPEAKER_07]: produce food or land covered by cities,
roads and buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: The remaining piece, one thirty second of
the apple, represents the portion of the
[SPEAKER_07]: Earth where food can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is our farmland.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thin peel of this slice represents the
farmland's layer of topsoil where our food
[SPEAKER_07]: is grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every minute of every day, the United
States loses about an acre of farmland.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over seventy percent of America's fruit,
vegetables and dairy products are produced
[SPEAKER_07]: on farms near cities that lie directly in
the path of sprawling development.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sustainable practices and careful
planning, such as farmland conservation,
[SPEAKER_07]: are needed to protect this precious
resource for today and for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so these are my two children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're much older than this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey is now 270 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elle is almost as tall as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the center of our basketball team.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was their age, maybe a little bit
older, the one thing I always wanted was
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sixteen years ago, my wife and I,
we got that opportunity, so we bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: 102 acre farm just south of Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the house wasn't habitable,
so we had to rebuild the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that finished, we started farming
the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have chickens and eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have goats, a lot of cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned a lot from agriculture and
how it helps me at Cornell running the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came to the farm,
I talked to my neighbor who was farming
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and his comment to me was that Cornell
wasn't useful to him much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I got the opportunity to come
back to crops and soil sensors at the USDA
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time to direct the lab,
I decided I was gonna change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted our lab to be useful to farmers
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my experiences on the farm helped
me to develop new methods, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: methods that are in place except for the
soil testing was we were able to tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: what went wrong after it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a farmer, you want to know,
what do I need to do to prevent it from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started developing methods for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I guess, what we have in our soil
health program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He writes, while the farmer holds the
title to the land, actually belongs to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the people, because civilization itself
rests upon the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you farm it,
you begin to appreciate the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens if we lose it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to believe agriculture is
important to us not only as a food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a familiar experience, accessible
to everyone that it can help us understand
[SPEAKER_00]: many aspects of life, nature, and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is a practice so rooted in
reality that it can guide our decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing up this millennial age,
I guess, we sometimes think we're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the center of the universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is right there for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we want, we just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this news cable, not where we just
switched the channel and everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: there for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize that when you're farming,
your life is guided by nature and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to make decisions based on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you quickly learn that you're not the
center of the universe anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparing for this presentation,
I realized that our country was founded
[SPEAKER_00]: not by lawyers, but by a bunch of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to go back to the history of
our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I say maybe that's the
reason it's exceeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understood the laws of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They guided their decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a section taken out of the
Declaration of Independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wording is kind of hard from back
then, but I'll read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary for one people to
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve their political bands which have
connected them with another and to assume
[SPEAKER_00]: among the powers of the earth,
the separate and equal station to which
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws of nature and of nature's god
entitle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should declare
[SPEAKER_00]: the cause which impel them to separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what they probably from
agriculture and understanding the laws of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, they knew that the laws of nature
and nature's god gave them the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: become an independent nation that
contributed to our forming an independent
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
how they felt about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Booth wrote that the founding
fathers believed that the first president
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States, George Washington,
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James
[SPEAKER_00]: Madison were revolutionary farmers as much
as they were revolutionary politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They loved farming and gardening so much
that they gave that prominence even when
[SPEAKER_00]: engaged in war and politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening or farming was central to their
lives, and they were truly the first
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believed independent small-scale
farms were the building blocks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I became concerned about when I
had a farm is that we're losing all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: small farms to industrial farming,
and we need to find ways to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: having more small-scale farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to put things in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andrew Booth writes that Jefferson
believed that agriculture should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of American republic rather
than industry, that he put more importance
[SPEAKER_00]: to agriculture than to industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Washington studied and implemented
improved farming methods throughout his
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, he thought of himself first as a
farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington read the latest works on
agriculture and implemented the new
[SPEAKER_00]: husbandry methods using a variety of
fertilization methods and crop rotation
[SPEAKER_00]: plans on his five farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interviews with the National Republic
Radio, Andrew Booth described the founding
[SPEAKER_00]: fathers as obsessed with manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: George Washington had this building built
for the storing of compost from dung for
[SPEAKER_00]: his gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture places one in direct contact
with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches us the laws of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're forced to experience it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to adapt your life to the way
things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a cycle to it that we need to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is totally involved in our
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Soil Health book, I read that in
ancient writings such as the Bible,
[SPEAKER_00]: the book of Genesis, the word Adam means
red soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason, in this
description, human beings came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil because soil brought forth life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Native American Indian cultures treat
the soil as a living good neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They respect and revere it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they talk about you should walk on the
soil like you're walking on somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be very gentle with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one culture, people take water from a
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They first pour a portion of the water
onto the ground to give the soil a drink
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how much they respect and revere
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many of today's developing countries,
people view using too much fertilizer as
[SPEAKER_00]: we may view taking illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see it as making the soil addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they like to keep things in a natural
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think it's good to
support organic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are converting one of our fields to an
organic farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know personally how hard it is to pick
up all the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of us put off studying for an
exam or crammed the night before?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all did it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this approach doesn't work in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't procrastinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of us know a farmer that can put
off milking his cows until Friday or the
[SPEAKER_00]: night before a test, the night before he
wants to do the milking?
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we cram in the fall for a crop
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to plant in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the spring and the summer, you begin
harvesting wood for the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the weather is right or you have five
consecutive days of sun and the hay is
[SPEAKER_00]: tall enough to harvest, that's the time
you harvest hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your life is basically controlled by
your climate and by your weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it the way you always the
way you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn that very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some goat stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only good thing about having these
goats, they gave me lots of good material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, my son had problems
with tolerance to milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I told my neighbor about maybe we'll
try looking at getting some goats because
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear that was better for milk
intolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks later, two goats showed up,
and I've never touched a goat before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pregnant, and they needed to be
milked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to quickly learn within hours how
to milk a goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no place to store them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so two experiences I had with them
was two of the babies were born,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they couldn't milk off to the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to bottle feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was getting down to 10 degrees one
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took them off the bathroom,
off of our bedroom, went down to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: milk, and came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got out of the bathroom,
and they were standing next to the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they see me open the door and
come in, they jumped on the bed and
[SPEAKER_00]: started peeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so fortunately, the plastic
shipping container was still on the
[SPEAKER_00]: mattress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the bedding was up against the
headboard against the wall, and they only
[SPEAKER_00]: nailed the sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the worst part was when they seen me
rush over to get them, they squatted down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see them trying to squeeze it
all out before I got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they're only two weeks old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how mischievous goats are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I was building that hut there,
that plywood, I had it laid down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was cutting it to length.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I went to pick it up,
they all jumped on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this immense sense of knowing
what's the worst thing they could do at
[SPEAKER_00]: that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, some of our experience
is the reality of goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look so cute and innocent,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They start out so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I learned from them is,
how do you name a goat?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned from personal experiences,
the first two names of all goats is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you name a goat, you give it its
third name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, this is
[SPEAKER_00]: Bat Damn Brown Ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first two names for goats is Bat
Damn, and then you put their name onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I learned also about farming
is, just as our culture is at church,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I understand in the Bible why Jesus
put the sheep on his right and the goats
[SPEAKER_00]: on his left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just a lot of things about
agriculture that you really learn
[SPEAKER_00]: firsthand the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you a couple of stories about
my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 11 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going into fifth grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, I think, she was in
kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was a little bit autistic,
so she couldn't speak until she was about
[SPEAKER_00]: second year through kindergarten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the therapist told us we had to
keep the animals because by the time she
[SPEAKER_00]: was with them, she would speak more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to keep them for therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to think of getting rid of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were wondering how much was it going to
cost to keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weighed that against what she was
learning, and we decided to keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when she was four, the first thing
she did when she had the chickens,
[SPEAKER_00]: she decided that before they could all go
out free ranging, they all had to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: their flying test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave them all flying lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do them up in the air, let them come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so then she taught her friends how
to give chickens flying lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're wondering, what is she learning?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's watching The Little Bill
Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Little Bill has got, there's eight
bunny rabbits from school that he wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt into his apartment in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: His father tells him now, and he lists all
the reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Little Bill had already thought that
problem's out, and he's got a solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, his father's got no recourse left but
to consider letting him have these eight
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ella sees that happen on the TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks up at the television to give Mr.
Bill some advice, and she says,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those rabbits will poop a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the age of five, she has waist
management and scaled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told this to my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, she's really learning a lot from
being on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has now, already by the age of five,
has more insight than half of the faculty
[SPEAKER_00]: in the College of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one last story.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now in first grade at South Hill,
and she always gets books on nature
[SPEAKER_00]: because she wants to be a naturalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she loves the woods, and she loves the
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this book in this book,
this girl gets a baby goat for a birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that every day it would go
into its hut in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after several times this happening,
the goat goes in the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It snows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl thinks she's got a goat that can
forecast the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time it goes into its hut,
she calls up all the radio stations and
[SPEAKER_00]: the news companies, and they come down,
and it didn't snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she goes into the hut to see why the
goat was in there, and it didn't snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it turned out the goat had given
birth to two baby kids, and that's why it
[SPEAKER_00]: had to go into the hut without it snowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't catch on quick enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter turns to that front page,
sizes up the horns on that goat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no access to a billy goat on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way that goat could have gotten
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That author then had no credibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: She turns over to one of the previous
pages, looks at the picture of the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: animals in the corner, and says,
Dad, that mouse doesn't belong there
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of our culture, kids learn a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is a source of micronutrient
malnutrition effect over 2 billion people
[SPEAKER_00]: resulting in poor health, including
coronary heart disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are all the important reasons
for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture is just more than a source of
food and human nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to deal with soil management and
research in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find that it's greatly affected by
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farming has taught me the importance of
keeping a system in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I failed to comply with the laws
of nature and the system went out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance, it didn't end well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural policy needs a combination of
both theory and practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very appreciative for my education
at Cornell and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also learned that a good education
helps prevent us from being deceived by
[SPEAKER_00]: ignorance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some sense of spirituality and
understanding of the laws of nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: complying with them can help us from being
deceived by our intellect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're always surrounded by
education, I think there's a tendency for
[SPEAKER_00]: us in academic institutions to think that
our intellect is infallible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I learned on a farm
when I got to farm was my neighbor was a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer knew a lot more than I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of theoretical practices,
but I needed some common sense to go with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So agriculture and climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to explore the connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my expertise in analytical chemistry,
that perspective on how I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change based as a spectroscopist.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in this Ithaca, New York,
your life expectancy is much longer
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming to be the son of God than it is
if you come out or even propose the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility that climate change may be due
to natural causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to tell you as a
spectroscopist is why I think that it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's science of the founding fathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This belief and experience meant that
nature was the highest authority over
[SPEAKER_00]: ruling and vetoing any human authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: This point of view was encapsulated in the
model from the Royal Society, the premier
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific society in the world,
Nullus in Britain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, on the words of no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, check it out for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen some of the evidence of this
and I decided it was important to check it
[SPEAKER_00]: out for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a pretty good background in
chemistry and some in physical chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking into this more
deeply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how we approach climate change
tells us what adaptive methods we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we use the wrong ones, it could end
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the mechanism for climate
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you have energy coming into the
earth, some of it leaving up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, and then some of it coming
back down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this back radiation they say is about
340 watts per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the net what's going out is 239.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's basically we're
accumulating a little more energy than
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the mechanism for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So global warming and climate change are
both real and serious issues that we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I experienced them firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to be careful that we don't
get blindsided by causes other than CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the mechanism of greenhouse
effect correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the current model confuses the word
thermal equilibrium with steady state.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their first mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second mistake is it only recognizes
Kirchhoff's law and ignores the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal collisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll explain these independently later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirchhoff's law has got some flaws in it
to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to recognize that spectral
displays that you see come off an
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument are distorted and can lead to
erroneous conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these things need to be taken into
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these circumstances are taken into
consideration, it's possible that the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of atmosphere needed to create the
greenhouse effect would be reduced from 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 16,000 feet down to about 350 feet,
resulting in thousands of feet of extra
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere not used to warm the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the limiting factor controlling
global warming may not be CO2 but
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the spectroscopy evidence suggests
is that if this is 16,000 feet and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: required and there's still radiation
getting up to that height, then adding
[SPEAKER_00]: more CO2 to the atmosphere would increase
global warming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So human activity would have an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if there's enough CO2 in the
atmosphere at 350 feet to absorb all the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation that's coming off the surface of
the earth, that's that infrared radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of this from here up to the outer
space is now extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so adding more to the natural extra
that's already there is not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the outcome or very little change
to the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin with, some basic physical
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four types of kinetic energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Translational energy, which is thermal
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotational energy, which we know is
microwave energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vibrational energy, which is infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electromagnetic radiation, which is the
lights that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when electrons from an excited
state go back to a ground state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Maxwell-Boltzmann equation for
thermal equilibrium predicts the ratio of
[SPEAKER_00]: excited state of the electrons,
both vibrational rotational to the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: state as a function of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right here, that's in degrees Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your ground state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your excited state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says that when there's excitation of
CO2, this is going to get excited more as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get increased temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this predicts how much it will be
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all based on excitation of your
compound of interest by temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have radiation coming from
the surface of the earth plus temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: imposing on CO2, then the Nb over Na
becomes overpopulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of excited CO2 is now greater
than what is predicted by this equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they should use the term steady
state and not thermal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is probably the most abused
equation in science because nobody really
[SPEAKER_00]: understands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use it without totally understanding
what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Globing-Mohr modeling is based on
the assumption that the earth's surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and the atmosphere being in thermal
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the case because the equation
holds true if the source of energy is
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of global warming,
we are dealing with both radiation energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and thermal energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, these energies are in constant state
of flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system is at steady state,
not thermal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the excited state of CO2 at the
four micron peak, it's about 0.03%.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the 15 micron peak, it's about 2%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plug about 300 degrees Kelvin or
270 degrees Kelvin in that is for
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when CO2 absorbs infrared radiation to
the surface of the earth, the excited
[SPEAKER_00]: state becomes overpopulated, keeping it
from being in thermal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mechanism for global warming is based
on Kirchhoff's law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a good absorber of radiation
is also a good emitter of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, that's generally
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But infrared radiation, IR radiation
radiating from the surface of the earth is
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 then becomes excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it releases the infrared
radiation in all directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth absorbs some of the radiation
converting it to back to black body
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then warming of the air happens through
convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, the radiation is coming up
from the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hits the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 absorbs that radiation from one
direction, but it releases it in all
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the ground absorbs that radiation,
there's a net direction down towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less of it going up in the
atmosphere, more of it's coming down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where they get that forcing
mechanism and what they call the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some problems with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they didn't take into account is the
fact that nitrogen and oxygen are
[SPEAKER_00]: combining or colliding with that excited
CO2 at a rate of about 3 billion times a
[SPEAKER_00]: second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, instead of just the
radiation warming the ground, it directly
[SPEAKER_00]: warms the air around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under those conditions, instead of
needing a lot of atmosphere to direct the
[SPEAKER_00]: light back down to the earth, you need a
much smaller volume of atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: making more accessible in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they say is that when you look at
this spectrum here, there's a serious
[SPEAKER_00]: problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: The tops of these things are all flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know why that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically because the radiation from
the ground isn't getting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting to the outer space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing you notice is the water
makes up about 98% of the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the shaded areas here is energy
that's being absorbed and preventing and
[SPEAKER_00]: warming the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the white areas here is the emission
going back to outer space, cooling the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what makes it whether the warm or cold
is how these things are kept in balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if this is already saturated,
adding more, how much is that going to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect global warming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to increase global warming
by adding more CO2 when it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that depends on the altitude that all
this takes place at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one thing that we don't
have a direct measure of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a paper by Hung and Barrett
versus IPC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what it shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very interesting results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this first curve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is CO2 alone in an ampule in a vial
or a cuvette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it absorbs this much radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add helium to it, it absorbs more
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add nitrogen to it, the radiation
that absorbs is three times more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that when CO2 is colliding
with nitrogen and oxygen, it's making more
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 atoms or molecules available for
absorption, increasing its efficiency as a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning again, you need less atmosphere
than what's predicted if you only look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kirchhoff mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IPC claims that the doubling of CO2
concentration would widen the absorption
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this area between the pink and
the black line that I put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this spectra comes down and it
widens out at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're saying is that if you
double the CO2, then this white area where
[SPEAKER_00]: the radiation is taped out of space would
get smaller because this would start to
[SPEAKER_00]: fill in with the CO2 absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think that's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a spectroscopist's point of view,
we know that these images have distortions
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't directly, you have to
realize that this absorption peak is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually wider than what's displayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of distortions in these
spectrometers and you need to be aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you do your calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're saying is that the IPCC is
saying that this would account for an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional 4.3 watts per meter square of
energy coming back to the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that's probably not going to
happen and I'll explain why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's, I'm sorry about this slide,
I'm not very good at PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to have a perfect
spectrometer that was going to image
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the radiation pattern that is
entering it, what you would have would be
[SPEAKER_00]: these straight blue, green, and red lines
with nothing in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but when the light enters into a
spectrometer, it gets distorted because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grating, the width of the entrance
slit, the width of the exit slit,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lenses, whatever's used to image the
light or the energy coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ends up being distorted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shifts it to the left and to the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this line here, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say this green light is 500
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emission coming at 495 is not a
wavelength of 495.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wavelength of 500 that has been
displayed at 495.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means when you look at these
spectra, the only part that's accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the spectrum is what's exactly in
the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's on the edges is distortions and
you need to keep that in mind when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: making your interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what happens, it's sort of like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's me throwing a basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice that when you take a
picture of it because you can't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: instant image, it gets distorted,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a close up of it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: This same effect is the same thing that
happens inside a spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to know about, understand
this when you run calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IBC claims that this doubling would
be 4.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm saying the reason this peak is
narrow and is not matching the black line
[SPEAKER_00]: is because the radiation in the white
areas is spilling over into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: preventing it from being as wide as it
really would be displayed if we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Dr. Heinz-Hung did an experiment,
he looked at, he used a high-res
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his conclusions was that the amount of
additional radiation coming back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth if you doubled CO2 would be just
small edges here and here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the forcing would be only 0.054
watts per meter squared rather than the
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.3 that's predicted by the IPCC,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the global warming is gonna be a lot
less if you increase CO2 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had trouble finding any place that
explained exactly how they do the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found this paper by the American
Chemical Society that gave an attempt at
[SPEAKER_00]: explaining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what bothered me was the fact that it
says, this figure simulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if you had an imaginary
atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure, how did they do their
measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they just take direct measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did they just do a simulation to come
up with these numbers that they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: for what's gonna happen if we increase CO2
in our atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is the temperature gonna change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not comfortable if people are just
doing simulations rather than direct
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying that the red line is wider
than the blue line based on a simulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there is enough evidence
to come to a definitive conclusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material presented here needs to be
given serious consideration and not we
[SPEAKER_00]: just accept the dogma that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To resolve this issue, we need a direct
measure and not a model for the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere needed to create the greenhouse
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know how much of the atmosphere is
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important because we need to know
which adaptive strategies and policies we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really critical for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiment we need to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know the concentration of CO2
at different locations around the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the amount of CO2 in the
atmosphere, the limiting factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: or is radiation from the sun limiting?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we add more CO2 to the atmosphere,
will it add to the greenhouse effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the altitude you have to go
before all the radiation from the Earth is
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an experiment that measures the
radiation from the Earth that is absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: by CO2 at different elevations in the
Earth's atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the technical problems with
infrared radiation and measuring it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the infrared radiation also comes
from the instrument itself and from the
[SPEAKER_00]: detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the detector is measuring its own
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically you need to get the
instrument chilled to like a minus 40
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you're doing your experiment,
the filament is about the same temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: as the surface of the Earth at 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't chill the instrument,
then you can't see a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Beer's Law and it talks about
how anything is absorbed, how it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight and then it begins to tail off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if CO2 absorbs goes about to 95% at
12,000 feet, adding more anthropologic CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: would cause global warming because this
will continue up very slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it takes all 12,000 to 16,000 feet,
adding more CO2 by us would make an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If CO2 absorption falls off about 350
feet, more CO2 won't really matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would all be extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be like having a sponge pick
up one teaspoon water, adding 10 sponges
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't gonna pick up any more water because
you've already absorbed all of it or
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's see if this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you block out the, what was the,
so it starts out with a laser which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: source of radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you replace that with a light tube,
turn it upside down, face it towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it into a minus 40 degree box.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason it didn't turn around,
but anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to turn the helicopter
around, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so now aim it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you come in with a, where's the
helicopter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there it is, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the helicopter comes in and now it's
supposed to fly off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is an experiment we need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know exactly where that absorption
takes place at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in case the previous slide didn't
work, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say we put, we need to know here
and here and at what point does the
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption go nearly to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really critical measurement that
we don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I just wanna give you some
perspective of the historical record that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have high levels of CO2
gradually coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the temperature of the Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the oceans froze over,
warmed up, and right now we're over here,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are still in the ice age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is the same thing, but it's on a
log scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it amplifies the recent history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see recently, we've had climate
change going on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's trending up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look what the trends have been before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, climate change is something that's
been going on for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think there's any reason to
expect that this is always gonna be the
[SPEAKER_00]: new norm of what we're experiencing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So climate change gives us a real
challenge for growing more food because it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make it harder to grow food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why I think adaptation becomes
so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm so enthusiastic about the
soil health program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't take good care of the
soil, you lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna be able to grow crops
when you have issues with climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too much water or too little,
it's gonna be hard to grow food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a no-till farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much better practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absorbs water through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores water in the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil doesn't run off and you can grow
more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use molecular biology to grow
aluminum-tolerant plants that can
[SPEAKER_00]: withstand weathering in various
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can grow food in more arid lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to use greenhouse operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tomatoes from back there came from our
greenhouse operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned in using controlled
environmental agriculture, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually grow very good tasting tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can isolate it from the
environment, I can control disease without
[SPEAKER_00]: using pesticides or fungicides or
herbicides or any chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start them in January and they outgrow
the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't need to grow the
genetically modified, tasteless tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can actually grow good tasting ones and
sell them locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this needs to be more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my daughter and her friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planting seeds and pots in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna see if this will play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to... Let me go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of nice at what a farmer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the end of the slide and I hope
this is the future generation of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take any questions anybody has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Randy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said to suggest to Manilow to
do your experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: To what?
[SPEAKER_03]: To the people in Manilow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have the temperature and the
CO2 concentration at the exact same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know where the window is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they know how the CO2 concentration is
changing at any given time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we also need to know what it is over
the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to know what it's over land.
[SPEAKER_00]: What altitude does our atmosphere absorb
all that infrared radiation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the real crux of the whole
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think was it... Oh, not how many
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said there's lies, denormalized and
other statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we should then extend that to
computer modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the numbers right,
you don't understand your system,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it becomes hard to give an accurate
prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think we have to revise a little
bit your story of the American Declaration
[SPEAKER_02]: of Independence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, George Washington may have been a
farmer, but how many slaves did he have
[SPEAKER_02]: actually tilling?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much was he himself tilling?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know about Jefferson.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did have this idealism and John Adams
was sitting up there in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't quite get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Declaration of Independence
was primarily, as we now know about,
[SPEAKER_02]: because Britain was about to abolish
slavery, because the King was dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Indians fairly, Native Americans
fairly, and because he let the Quebecers
[SPEAKER_02]: keep their Catholic religion.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you read in the Declaration of
Independence, the list of grievances
[SPEAKER_02]: against the King, you're gonna see this
part you put was just window dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we can't just let that go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you go back to the slide that has
the window where the earth is radiating?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going back the wrong way,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one, but the one before it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one before we had the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one?
[SPEAKER_03]: The one like that, but it had the window.
[SPEAKER_03]: The window of radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that five slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one.
One more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the window where the earth is
radiating at the temperature of Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earth is radiating in all of the
areas that are in white.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the black body radiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is inverted, because this is
looking at... You can't do that here,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the absorbed...
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives you radiance as a function of
weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some very standard entry-level
textbooks that have those two diagrams
[SPEAKER_04]: juxtaposed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see that the black body emissions
keep from a sort of terrestrial
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where would that be on the diagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tells you where the heat radiation from
the earth... Yeah, it's not on this
[SPEAKER_00]: diagram, because this is an absorption
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where also where the water
sits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have another... I believe
this is at atmospheric pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: or throughout the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be low pressure to high
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of it's going to be surface,
some of it's also going to be a result up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the upper atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's vertically integrated from the
surface of the earth's outer space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the question becomes does the CO2
radiation, does the radiation from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth that CO2 can capture, does it get
that high to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the important question.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heat is right at the same center point
almost as the CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water vapor window that you alluded to
is slightly to the left, which is not
[SPEAKER_04]: where the earth is emitting most of the
radiation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one that you alluded to widening
is actually not a major emission
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature or a radius band of the
earth's surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think glossing over those details is
a little misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I don't have the slide to...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too many, so I didn't have the slide
to... It's not so misleading in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: what your story is, because the peak
around four microns is really irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter if it... There's not
much heat coming, there's not much...
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like where they sold the radiation
and the earth's radiation process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only peak that's really important
is the one near 15 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing to keep in mind that the
energy at this end of the spectrum is much
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than the energy at this end of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earth is in the middle of almost
nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the solar mostly, and we have storm
time by the water vapor in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I totally agree, and that's why we get
this sort of radiation resort in the
[SPEAKER_04]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the peak of the earth's radiation,
the standard on CO2, is really an
[SPEAKER_04]: important part of the story.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go forward to your paleo climate
slides, that's a very outdated curve that
[SPEAKER_04]: you showed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot of work since then
trying to prepare the climate so you went
[SPEAKER_04]: to your glacial inter-glacial climate
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm basically limited what I can
tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it back to the Cambrian.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true that there were cold climates in
the past, and that major dip that occurs
[SPEAKER_04]: right at the end of the Artemisian is
well-known, and also the Hermian
[SPEAKER_04]: extinction.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are well-known events who have
correlated, especially that second one,
[SPEAKER_04]: to go back to the end of the... Basically,
the Hermian, the end of the Carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 million years, Carboniferous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Carboniferous is named after the
drawdown of CO2 by terrestrial plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is linked to widespread glaciation,
which actually supports the hypothesis of
[SPEAKER_04]: a strong correlation between CO2 and
climate for time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree, in the last half-million
years we've been in an isolated climate on
[SPEAKER_04]: average, but the numbers in terms of
actual temperature increases we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about during the period of dinosaurs,
I mean, it's very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It correlates with CO2, and it would have
huge consequences for agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it would.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it matters that it's CO2 because
there's something we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's something that we can do
about it, but then it all comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: this one basic answer, which we don't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of it in the atmosphere do we
need that's causing the climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it this much, or is it this much?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the critical spectroscopic answer
that we have to have made.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how did they arrive at those water
levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they use the wrong assumptions from
the spectroscopy curves?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question I'm writing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's just one method.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a similar estimate if you look
at, you cited Euler, who was a climate
[SPEAKER_04]: change skeptic for a while, until he
developed his own reconstruction of global
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures going back to 1700.
[SPEAKER_04]: You showed the curve in Euler 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you use that time series of global
temperature and the volcanic eruptions,
[SPEAKER_04]: you get a sensitivity of radiative terms
to about saying 3.5, 3.7 watts per square.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's all he knows, but it's still
radiative forcing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the radiative force of CO2 you can
get either from the models like you cited,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it could be from, okay, the climate
evidence, which puts you at about the same
[SPEAKER_04]: ballpark.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it from a simple energy balance
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's multiple avenues that give us
this two to four degree estimate,
[SPEAKER_04]: and those are well known, and to gloss
over that I think is not an accurate
[SPEAKER_04]: portrayal of the science, the state of the
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to use the board and give
us the derivation of the force of contact?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: For CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's articles here that people are
welcome to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have copies of them if they want to go
through some of the other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it from both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
