[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for offering a very nice place
for me to study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay hello everyone and hello to the guys
at Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay I'm very glad to be here to share
with you some interesting stories about
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's pump reading history based on my
study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that my talk today is very
closely related to the previous one of
[SPEAKER_00]: this series which was given by Dr. Lee
Kass on last Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Lee Kass talked about the whole
history, more than 100 years history,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole story of Cornell's pump reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: While my talk today actually is about some
episodes in that history and some aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of or some background stories especially
in terms of the international involvement
[SPEAKER_00]: of Cornell's pump reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the international
involvement of pump reading here I think
[SPEAKER_00]: most people will think about a very
well-known project conducted by Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: University pump reading department and
University of Nanking China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that project has a very very long
official name here but from here we can
[SPEAKER_00]: know who are the parties working on that
project and where did the funding come
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can easily remember this project as
a very short name the Cornell Nanking
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people also think that this story
is a beginning of Cornell's international
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement in the field of agriculture
especially to offer the assistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: China's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to my findings here I found the start
point should be much earlier when as early
[SPEAKER_00]: as 1897 in 1897 the first agriculturist
from Cornell going to China his name is
[SPEAKER_00]: Gerald Brill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually was born in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family owned the farm at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to Cornell to study agriculture in
1883 and after five years he got his
[SPEAKER_00]: bachelor's degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he just went back to his family farm
to run that farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later he came back again for
his graduate study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in the year of 1897 when he came
back in the same year he went to China to
[SPEAKER_00]: help with the agricultural work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may ask why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did he stop his study and go to China
because that was a very early time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a kind of matter of courage a
very courageous trial to do that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why he went there actually
should have started from this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy is a very high level or very
influential official in China at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in late Qing dynasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dynasty was the last feudalism
dynasty in China's history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The late Qing dynasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time some of the officials or
intellectuals realized China needs some
[SPEAKER_00]: reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the fields of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them especially represented by
this guy decided to take some reform or
[SPEAKER_00]: take some trials to do something on
agriculture improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his trials is to try to establish
an agriculture school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although China has been leading in
agriculture for a very very long time but
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a kind of traditional agriculture
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of modern agriculture he decided
to have a school to teach the Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: people some modern ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some advanced agriculture practice or
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I forgot to talk about his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Chang Zhidong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a vice Roy in a province of central
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Hubei province of central China.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he decided to open this agriculture
school in modern sense he had to find
[SPEAKER_00]: someone to work for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he turned to several foreigners who
were in China at that time for help to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a very right person to do that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the foreigners helped him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Patrick.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a priest just working in that
province at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a year graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't try to contact his alma
mater because he think Cornell might be
[SPEAKER_00]: better in agriculture than Yale.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wrote a letter to Sherman, the third
president of Cornell in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more connection between Sherman and
China is that after he left the presidency
[SPEAKER_00]: of Cornell here he was appointed as the
ambassador of the United States to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Republican China.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a later connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patrick wrote this letter to Sherman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherman gave this letter to Roberts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roberts was the dean of College of
Agriculture then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he decided Breel might be the best
candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the vice Roy requested that this
candidate should know well about modern
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should have a kind of ability to teach
agriculture as well as to run a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like what I mentioned, Breel had the
experience of running a family farm and he
[SPEAKER_00]: learned agriculture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he might be the best candidate to go to
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, Breel decided to take the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he went to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to China just in the year of 1897.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after his arrival in China,
he signed these contracts with that vice
[SPEAKER_00]: Roy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the contracts in English and
Chinese languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those contracts are still kept in
Cornell archives, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after one year, I mean in the year
1898, Breel helped that vice Roy to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish that agriculture school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the school began to enroll the first
group of students in the year of 1898.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a notice or ask for the enrollment
of that agriculture school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also kept in Cornell archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in that year, I mean the first
year of the opening of that school,
[SPEAKER_00]: Breel invited another American people,
his Cornellian, fellow Cornellian named
[SPEAKER_00]: Gilmore to go to China to work as his
assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that from this picture,
there were two American people with a
[SPEAKER_00]: group of Chinese students.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I should say, unfortunately,
they didn't, I mean these two guys didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in China for a long time because they
came across a lot of difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when they too would like to
have a piece of field to just build an
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental farm, they had to explain a
lot to that vice Roy because they will
[SPEAKER_00]: always ask, how much money can you make
from that farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to Chinese people's, at that time,
to Chinese people's concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, they just think, oh,
the farm is just to make money,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to do agricultural production,
just to get profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to explain a lot of times the
experimental farm is totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ordinary farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot count on it to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are used for experiment, but they
were not understood well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the difficulties they came
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just after three or four years,
finally they too resigned and came back to
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I would like to mention is
that Grille has a very good habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept a very good collection of
different kinds of archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those archives came to Cornell archives,
I mean, after his death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can still see a lot of pictures and
newspapers, letters, a lot of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: different forms in Cornell archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are very valuable materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people who are interested in that part
of the history in China's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think, hey, this guy doesn't have
anything to do with plant breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about plant breeding in
this seminar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing I would like to say is
that his connection with plant breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: that before he went to China, he also
visited the USDA and he got a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment he was assigned as a special
representative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from this paper, he was
assigned as a special representative of
[SPEAKER_00]: USDA to China to do some investigation,
to do some, you know, collection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant resources in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means while he was working for
Viceroy with that agriculture school,
[SPEAKER_00]: he also worked for the USDA to collect the
plant resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the archives we know and from some of
the letters he wrote to the USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that he wants to collect quite a
few different kinds of plant resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: send them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed, the seedlings, and those things
were used later for plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing that Grille was
connected to plant breeding here is that
[SPEAKER_00]: after he came back to America,
he actually had been working on several
[SPEAKER_00]: farms as a manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the archives we know that he kept
very close and frequent communication with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you may know Dr. Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He once was the head of the Department of
Plant Breeding here from 1942 to 1949.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Love actually worked closely with
Grille, especially Dr. Love did some
[SPEAKER_00]: research or experiment on Grille's farm
for plant breeding or even for extension
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Love, by the way, he was also a
very chief participant of the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanking story I just mentioned at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he decided to go to China,
before he decided to have that project
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, I mean the Cornell Nanking story
happen, he also wrote the letters to
[SPEAKER_00]: Grille to ask for some suggestions or some
useful information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is another connection between
Grille and Cornell's plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not the main part of my story
today because those happened, I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: Grille went to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in the Qing Dynasty, not in the
Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Qing Dynasty was followed by the
Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I will focus on is a period of the
Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within a period of Republic of China,
not only that was a viceroy, I think more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more people, especially the officials
and intellectuals, they began to realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we must do something on Chinese
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a kind of urgent need to improve
on Chinese agriculture so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication between China and Western
nations in terms of agriculture developed
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast in that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the Sino-U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: communication in agriculture was the
fastest growing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this kind of communication took
place in two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the Chinese students came to study
in America, especially study agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way is that some, American
agriculturists, they went to China to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer some help, offer some instruction
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we can just look at both of the
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first way is the Chinese people coming
to America to study agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to glorify Cornell,
but I think talking about Sino-U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: communication in agriculture, Cornell
should be the one to be named as the
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from the number, from 1912 to
1927, altogether there were 170 students
[SPEAKER_00]: from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came to study in America for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among them, 14 came to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the biggest group compared with
the students to other universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the following 10 years,
190 students were sent by Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: government to study agriculture here,
and one third of them chose Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: As their university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared with the other, the students to
other universities, Michigan, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: still the biggest group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can see Cornell is the first
choice for the students to study
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among all the Chinese students coming
here, this guy should be named,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not sure whether, you know,
Chinese people or American people know
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy very well, his name is Hu Shi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Hu Shi actually graduated from
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was considered as a key contributor
to China's language reform and liberalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the connection between him and
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this guy was originally sent to
Cornell to study agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later, he thought, oh, I'm not quite
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he changed his major to philosophy and
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he later worked as a minister of
education in the Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing interesting that is
that this guy also, he's a very talented
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also took part in the English speaking
context of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He beat all the American students who
speak English as a native language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got a first prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very talented people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, besides Hu Shi, actually, there are
quite a few very outstanding
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculturists in the period of Republican
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they graduated from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they went back to serve their
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's look at the other side,
the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American people, agriculturists going
to China, we should name this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is John Lawson Buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Cornellian, went to China in
1910s or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he was the very person who
established the first department of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture economics in China,
just in the University of Nanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, he's the very person who
conducted the first investigation or
[SPEAKER_00]: research on rural economy and farm
management in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, he was considered, actually,
a kind of father of the discipline of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture economics in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very influential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still remembered by people doing
agriculture economics in China today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe also to American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing about him is that he got
married with Pearl Buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lady was a daughter of a priest in
China then.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lady actually was born in China and
grew up in China, so she spoke very good
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese as well as English.
[SPEAKER_00]: While after their marriage, she just went
together with Dr. Buck to do those
[SPEAKER_00]: investigation in rural areas and mainly
just worked as a translator or
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, Pearl Buck wrote a novel named
The Good Earth based on her experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a kind of a very vivid and good
portrait of Chinese rural life in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that novel, this lady was
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1938.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you will think, hey, you should go
to Warren Hall to talk about these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are still doing plumb breeding
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the connection between this guy and
plumb breeding China is that the person
[SPEAKER_00]: invited him to work in the University of
Nanking was John Henry Reisner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main story I will talk about
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will talk about this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His life, his work, his contributions in
terms of plumb breeding to China's
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I talk about Reisner, I would like
to have a few words on the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanking and the College of Agriculture
because at that time, he worked as a dean
[SPEAKER_00]: of the College of Agriculture in that
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, we can see the University of
Nanking was founded in 1888.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was a private university
sponsored by American churches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was proud to be the first
educational institution in China
[SPEAKER_00]: officially named as University in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, most of the institutions were
called schools or something, not the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the first one to use university
as an English name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was registered with the New York
State Education Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the students graduated from
that university.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could come directly to any university
here in New York State without taking any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their academic achievement will be
approved and accepted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the College of Agriculture in that
university was one of the strongest
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges in that college.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was considered as, it was actually the
first institute in China to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: four-year bachelor degree education in
field of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it was considered, I mean the
establishment of that college was
[SPEAKER_00]: considered as a beginning of China's
modern higher education in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very meaningful step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that college later evolved into the
current Nanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanking Agricultural University.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the university I'm now working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm quite interested in this part of the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of the reasons why the
College of Agriculture is very strong is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it once got involved in the Cornell
Nanking project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Nanking story project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop requesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the reason why the college
was very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because of that project, those
faculty were trained by the American
[SPEAKER_00]: experts and the research ability would
improve a lot of results achieved from
[SPEAKER_00]: that project.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will just go on to talk about the
Reissner, the Guy Reissner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are interested in that story,
I would recommend you to have a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be downloaded from online now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see from here, actually this book
was co-authored by two persons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reissner and Dr. Leff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, this is a Chinese version.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just translated and published it in
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got involved in translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I like this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two authors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think compared with Dr. Leff,
Reissner also did a very great job in that
[SPEAKER_00]: history, in that project, but he was not
remembered as much as Dr. Leff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I would like to give you
more stories and things about Reissner
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we should know how significant this
person is.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Cornell alumni news, from a new
story, it was once said to be perhaps the
[SPEAKER_00]: foremost graduate performing outstanding
service to agriculture by Cornell in
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a buyer sketch of this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although actually he did a lot of mission
work, religious service in other
[SPEAKER_00]: developing nations, but he also did a lot
of agricultural work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still think that he is an
agriculturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was born in Virginia and grew up in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to Yale College in 1907,
and after four years, he got a bachelor's
[SPEAKER_00]: degree in arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember, he got a degree in arts,
not in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, just because of his
contribution to agriculture mission work,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure whether you're familiar with
agriculture mission work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in the history, some American
churches, they wish to combine the mission
[SPEAKER_00]: work and agriculture services together so
that the churches can participate more in
[SPEAKER_00]: those rural area services and to increase
their influence in those developing
[SPEAKER_00]: nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, he devoted most of his life
to the agriculture mission work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he was awarded the honorary degree of
master of arts in 1950 by his alma mater,
[SPEAKER_00]: Yale University.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Yale College actually was the
undergraduate college of Yale University
[SPEAKER_00]: in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he died in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mostly, yeah, he did most of the
agricultural mission work after he came
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back from China in 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: After he came back, he basically worked
with this organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also, in 1950s, he once worked as
the observer for various church agencies
[SPEAKER_00]: with FAO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, he was a member of the advisory
committee of the technical corporation and
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was also called the point four
program in history recommended by
[SPEAKER_00]: President Truman in American history,
just mainly focusing on having some
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperation, technical cooperation with
other developing nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why he was also related to
President Truman's point four program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may still have this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a year graduate a bachelor of arts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did he turn to do agricultural plant
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: How was he connected with plant breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, the story started from this
movement, the student volunteer movement
[SPEAKER_00]: of foreign missions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he graduated from Yale in 1911,
that was just the peak time of the student
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer movement of foreign missions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of college students graduated
from university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they went to other nations to do some
religious service full of passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Reissner was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the oral history, and also,
I tried to contact the descendants of
[SPEAKER_00]: Reissner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his granddaughter offered me some very
valuable information and documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: From those materials, I got to know that
after he graduated from Yale, he was
[SPEAKER_00]: firstly offered a job to teach biology in
University of Nanking because that
[SPEAKER_00]: university was sponsored by American
churches here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was actually a mathematics major in
Yale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought, maybe I cannot teach
biology very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, he got to know that the
College of Agriculture will be established
[SPEAKER_00]: in the University of Nanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He thought, hey, I'm more interested in
teaching agriculture because I once did
[SPEAKER_00]: some agriculture while I was young because
it helped to do some farm work while he
[SPEAKER_00]: was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he still didn't think that he has got
enough preparation to teach agriculture to
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he just came to Cornell in 1912 to
attend some summer school courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That experience really opened the eyes of
Reissner to the idea of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and advanced agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he decided to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came back in 1913 to register for his
master degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under, yeah, his major was farm crops
and his minor was just plumb breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: under Professor Gilbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also a member of the Plumb Breeding
Department's Synapses Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Lee talked about this club last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a club for the plumb breeding faculty
and students to meet regularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have dinners, to have social lives,
to even have seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so from this picture,
we can see this young gentleman was
[SPEAKER_00]: Reissner and his professor, Gilbert,
was sitting at the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, just in one year,
he finished all the required courses for
[SPEAKER_00]: his master degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means he finished his courses in
1914.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he didn't have enough time to finish
his thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to go to live for China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he finished his thesis in China
while he was working in University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Nanking.
[SPEAKER_00]: His thesis is about the wheat history,
the wheat planting history in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, he got his master degree in the
year of 1915 while he was in Nanjing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nanjing is the current name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city used to be called Nanking,
but now it's called Nanjing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so yeah, before he went to China,
he got to know a girl named Bertha Betts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That girl was also a student in a major of
home economics in the same college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before he went to China, he decided to
take her together with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: With him to go to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the girl agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just went together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, while they were in China,
mostly, most of the time, from,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, upon his arrival, in two years,
Reissner was working on the faculty at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Nanking in the College of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the rest, more than 10 years,
he worked as a dean or co-dean because for
[SPEAKER_00]: political reasons, sometimes, they have to
carry out a system of the co-dean with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese people working as another co-dean
so that they were not rejected by Chinese
[SPEAKER_00]: people just for some period of time in
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he worked as a dean or co-dean for more
than 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something about his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Reissner also did something while she
was in Nanjing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed a cookbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this cookbook is to teach
those non-Chinese people who were living
[SPEAKER_00]: in China to use some food stuff grown
locally to cook some dishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that book was actually published also
in English and Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can get a copy from Cornell
Archives if you want to have a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go back to Reissner's
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Reissner's oral history and to the
literature I found, actually, Reissner was
[SPEAKER_00]: the second person in China who had a
master's degree in either agriculture or
[SPEAKER_00]: in forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first guy was a Chinese person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He graduated from Michigan State
University and majoring in forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he went back earlier than Reissner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the University of Nanking,
he was the first person on the faculty
[SPEAKER_00]: with any training in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering the University of Nanking was
very leading in agriculture at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: in China, so you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reissner's work might be very pioneering
or forerunning in China, especially to
[SPEAKER_00]: China's agriculture and farm breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Reissner recorded almost anything
that one did in China at that time was a
[SPEAKER_00]: first, very meaningful and significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Reissner felt that his most notable
achievement that he made in China was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely in crop breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to my understanding or my story,
we'll talk about his work in China just by
[SPEAKER_00]: two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part of his contribution is that he
instituted the Cornell Nanking story that
[SPEAKER_00]: we just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later I will give you more background
information on this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part of his achievements is that
he did some personal trial on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding experiments and also got success
in that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very meaningful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very early, just upon his arrival in 1914,
he just started to do something on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be the first person to have
brought the modern technology of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding to China and to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, those are something from his oral
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually from here we know that he did
plant breeding mainly on two crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is on wheat and the other one is on
corn or maize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said he developed the first pure
string of wheat from a single plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: had a very good yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that variety was used as a chick
variety for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the corn, he also developed a
Chinese yellow corn from selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that corn also was proved to be very
successful in some parts of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the wheat first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wheat, actually to Chinese literature,
that wheat was named as a number 26
[SPEAKER_00]: developed by Weissner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is a table from a report of
Myers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myers, Dr. Myers was also one of the
participants in Cornell Nanking story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked in China for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before he left, he just submitted a report
on his work in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that report, we can see this table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that here, the standard
variety is number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number six is used as a standard variety
and it has got a better yield than those
[SPEAKER_00]: average farm varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the corn, the corn that he
developed was named as a Nanking yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He developed this corn, by year to row
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a, actually this method was
already commonly used in American
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment stations, but the first time to
be used in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was proved to be very, very
successful, especially in the area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Yangtze River.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from those successful experience,
Weissner has got more confidence in doing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said increased agriculture production
in China will come most easily and quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: through increasing yield by scientific
plant selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, those are some of his personal
trials in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second part of his contribution is
about the Cornell Nanking story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to give you some background
stories about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually the Cornell Nanking story
started because a serious famine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Huai River, that's central China,
Huai River, in 1920.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then President Wilson set up a committee
by responding to that famine, serious
[SPEAKER_00]: famine by setting up a committee to raise
a big sum of money to do the famine relief
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later that relief work ended sooner or
earlier than expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The committee found that they still have a
very big sum of money not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could they use this money in a very
wise way, very wide way or very effective
[SPEAKER_00]: way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Weissner just at that time got to the
news, got to know the news and he
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted a proposal to that committee
saying that this money could be used in a
[SPEAKER_00]: long run famine prevention instead of a
short run famine relief work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially that could be used in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that proposal was approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The College of Agriculture got $750,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really a very big sum of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's why the Cornell Nanking story
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next step for Weissner to do is to
design a concrete scheme or design what
[SPEAKER_00]: really he needs to do with that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he designed a very comprehensive
project, especially in the field of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding because we mentioned he has got a
lot of confidence in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he choose plant breeding as a main
work of the design project.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1924, he wrote to Dr. Love at plant
breeding here to discuss on the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility to invite some American
experts to come to China to work and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperate on plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in brief, that project finally involved
three experts from Cornell plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just went to China in turn,
each one being there for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each one of them just went to China
twice, each time one year there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a lot of things in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taught lessons, they gave lectures,
they instructed the experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they helped with the extension work,
they did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that actually it's a kind of
transferring of the land ground mode land
[SPEAKER_00]: ground college mode from Cornell to
University of Nanking, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: College of Agriculture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's a very comprehensive
project, the result achieved from the
[SPEAKER_00]: project is also very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people were trained, the high yield
crops were achieved, and the method was
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of achievements were got from that
very successful Cornell Nanking study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more thing about this project,
I mean the long lasting effect of that
[SPEAKER_00]: project is that it was commonly considered
as the first notable example of
[SPEAKER_00]: international technical cooperation in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's also related to the
recommendation for President Truman for US
[SPEAKER_00]: government's calling for program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a technical cooperation program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with the success of the Cornell
Nanking story, there is the following
[SPEAKER_00]: success of the Cornell Los Baneros story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, some comment from the other
people on Reissner's work and contribution
[SPEAKER_00]: in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy, this person is Dr. Shen Zonghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a very outstanding plant breeder in
China's agricultural history, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: in the period of the Republic of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he went to Taiwan during the time of
communist China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of contribution, not only to
China's agriculture, but also to
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture of Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a student of Dr. Love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also a Cornellian graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the year of 1935, he once made a speech
talking about the development of China's
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding creel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the reflection that China's plant
breeding started from 1915.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 10 years was just like a
person's childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the year of 1925, it was
transferred or transited to a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: person's childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, a teenager, teenager years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the first 10 years and second 10
years, different period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see from the timing,
the starting, the origin of China's plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding actually is about the time while
Reissner just arrived in China and started
[SPEAKER_00]: his trial in plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transition year is also the time
Reissner started and instituted that
[SPEAKER_00]: well-knowing Cornell Nanking story
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both stages are very closely related to
this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Shen also named several
representative persons for the two stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of China's starting years of plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Reissner was named respectively for
the two stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, finally, some epilogue for my talk
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I focus on Reissner's
contribution to China's agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: to China's plant breeding, but we should
always remember that it's never a one-way
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a win-win project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only in this way can such kind of
cooperation be very successful and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Cornell staff and students
may get a very global vision from such
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have more knowledge of the
situation in different areas on the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides that, they also can have some
valuable plant resources in history from
[SPEAKER_00]: such kind of cooperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One very good example is about Dr. Love
and his warm barley story, which was also
[SPEAKER_00]: told in Dr. Love's book, the Cornell
Nanking story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in brief, the warm barley is a
barley variety brought by Dr. Love from
[SPEAKER_00]: China to America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used that in plant breeding experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later, that variety was used for
extension and got a very big profit for
[SPEAKER_00]: New York wheat industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the variety was named as warm barley
just because a Chinese assistant working
[SPEAKER_00]: with Love while he was in China,
or the person who firstly saw that
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, his last name was Wong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was why it was named as warm
barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, since you know, it's always a
kind of mutually beneficial project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even nowadays, I still think it's much
easier or there are more opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: than before to make such kind of win-win
project happen in current time or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not only just beneficial to the two
parties of the cooperation, but even
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial to the global agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have not visited China,
if you have not worked with Nanjing
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural University, come on,
now is a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a new Cornell Nanking story is
just waiting for you to institute and
[SPEAKER_00]: participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very glad to be the liaison person or
to offer some information that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's all for my talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank this person and some
of the institutions who just helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: with my study, one year study here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions,
just I'm very glad to answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have time for a few questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think language barrier is always a
problem, but that's not the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those American people, they went to China.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they learned much Chinese,
but Chinese people maybe, mostly the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese people just helped to translate or
they spoke English very well so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can just work together with those American
people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I think things are much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese people maybe speak, I think more
and more Chinese people speak better
[SPEAKER_00]: English.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanna go there, don't worry
about language.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's actually from those early
archives of those Chinese students coming
[SPEAKER_00]: here, especially I just mentioned Dr. Hu
Shi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's also a kind of huge box
of papers about him, not Hu Shi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those paper are not kept by Hu Shi,
but kept a lady who was American people.
[SPEAKER_00]: She hosted Hu Shi in her family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kept a very good collection of
different kind of papers about this
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those papers, we can find very
interesting stories while those students
[SPEAKER_00]: just came in and how they settled down,
how they got used to the culture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very interesting thing is that also
Hu Shi's mother, also intellectual in
[SPEAKER_00]: China, she wrote a letter to the American
lady to show her appreciation,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course in Chinese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hu Shi translated that in very,
very good English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really admire his English, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the English people wrote that
letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think after a few years here,
Hu Shi just got used to the culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment here and he did very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nanjing is famous, or sadly so,
for what happened during the Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: occupation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to the university and the
College of Agriculture during that period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that period, most of the college
students were moved, they have to move,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the southwest of China.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, within the history of our
university, there was one part that the
[SPEAKER_00]: university was based in another province,
in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were still some foreigners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stayed in Nanjing because they are
American people, they're foreigners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a little bit different from the
Chinese people.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Japanese invaders, maybe they did not
do anything easily on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember there was one American
people, his name's Riggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually is in the field of
agriculture engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also got some funding, a sponsor from
Cornell in China Club, because at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time there was a kind of organization
named Cornell in China Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: The club is just to promote the
communication between Cornell and China.
[SPEAKER_00]: The club just offered some funding to that
American people to do some teaching and
[SPEAKER_00]: researching in China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very important person to work in
a kind of safe zone, to protect a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese people who left and who didn't
leave, who didn't run away in Nanjing at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting, touching story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened to the university during the
Cultural Revolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes, you might be interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a very interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the Cultural Revolution,
the Chairman Mao at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought that the agriculture
university, they should go to the rural
[SPEAKER_00]: area so that they can be very close to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those agriculture universities,
all of them just moved to very,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather remote or rural area, very small
county or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say the research, the teaching,
were actually interrupted because at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time most of the, there was always a kind
of chaos in the society, so the student
[SPEAKER_00]: teacher, they cannot have a very good
environment to study and do research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were moved out of the city,
but after the Cultural Revolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them, all of them just came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My university was also moved to a very
small city, not far from Nanjing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in 1981 it was moved back to the city
of Nanjing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just out of curiosity, how many people in
this room have been to China?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much more than my expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what about the rest ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to go there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, okay, so that's my purpose of giving
a talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
