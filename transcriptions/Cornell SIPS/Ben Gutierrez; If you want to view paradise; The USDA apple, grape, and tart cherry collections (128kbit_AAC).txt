[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot more people than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last time I did a talk here,
it was like two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like during the peak Zoom time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this talk does work so much
better if we're standing in the orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can like do the Willy Wonka,
like look at paradise, like look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful diversity collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're so close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like so close to paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva's not far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we do tours, public tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marvin, like we do lots of tours for
horticultural groups from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like take a chance to come up and see and
taste fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really how like germplasm is
meant to be interacted with and
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am the curator for the apple and tart
cherry collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about the grape
collection that's up there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am really grateful for this
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, like I'm the only one
talking today, but this is all like a team
[SPEAKER_00]: effort, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, you know, a core of three
scientists on the team and also Ganwan
[SPEAKER_00]: Zong, who's the research leader up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we have tremendous expertise in
grafting, in chemistry and pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: entomology now with the new addition,
Michaela Robertson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who can forget interns, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is kind of the highlight of the
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like advocate strongly for
anyone who's in the science, like mentor
[SPEAKER_00]: as many as you can, like find your
replacements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can't do this job forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need to get the next generation
motivated and trained to kind of step in
[SPEAKER_00]: and take the reins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, we've done, yeah, maybe 23
interns now at my time starting in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is, I think I always give
this quote from Aldo Leopold is like kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of my, like the philosophy that I try to
like frame all of our discussions in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're talking to broad audiences,
maybe this isn't the audience for the
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, but I think this is useful in
connecting to the next generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting people who don't think that
they're part of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really there are two spiritual dangers
in not owning a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the danger of supposing that
breakfast comes from the grocery and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other that heat comes from the furnace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that this part of New York
does a little bit better job at that than
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still there's a lot of work to do and
really like when you consider about two
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: population is directly involved in
agriculture or ranching, like it's pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot riding on the few that are
contributing to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how maybe it feels to all of you
working in your respective fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're Sisyphus pushing this boulder
up the hill and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: other fields I don't feel like have this
challenge that we do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they never made another
smartphone, I think we'd adapt,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like once they stop making
smartphones, we roll back to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotary phone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we stop the research and the
progress in agriculture, there really is a
[SPEAKER_00]: threat that we roll back production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We roll back that sustainability as new
pests, new challenges emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like really there's no end to what we
need to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really like passing that boulder off to
the next generation so that food security
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, yeah, not the pressing concern
for our society, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can solve other societal issues
rather than just trying to feed ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not all doom and gloom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the other, this is the flip
side getting to work in horticulture is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a joy and there is like a
childlike, you know, wonderment at the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that's out there and the
exciting discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, so this is not the original
Willy Wonka.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Tori Mecham, who's our molecular
biologist and a talented intern of ours
[SPEAKER_00]: did some nice Photoshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually I do need to update this
because I mentioned that to an NPR
[SPEAKER_00]: interview with Susan Brown, that Susan's
kind of the Willy Wonka for apples and
[SPEAKER_00]: they picked up on that and published it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Susan Brown kind of gets,
yeah, teased a little bit for her Willy
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonka-ness, but there's just, there's a
joy and like there's mystery and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, impishness to like coming to
visit the gene banks and tasting weird
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and yeah, not everything will pass
you as desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully this group is well versed in
germplasm and I don't know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe a course or thing that like
really hammers this home, but like what is
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just simply like bearers of heredity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these living resources that can
contribute to plant improvement and it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be any number of things, modern cultivars,
heirlooms, land races, crop wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives, like we do a lot of work with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I highlight here the value of
these crop wild relatives because all like
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root really exciting traits that
like, you know, I lose sleep at night
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about like how cool some of these
traits are, you know, the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance is huge for sustainability,
but flavor, like concord, kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: classic grape flavor comes from a wild
grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we associate, you know,
with the candy flavor of grape really is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a wild trait that is introgressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the production of strawberries,
like that ever bearing trait comes from a
[SPEAKER_00]: wild strawberry species from Utah where
I'm a native too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really like getting excited about,
you know, bringing in the crop wild
[SPEAKER_00]: relatives, like the land races have a
tremendous history and story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the story of civilization
told through agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important that like not just
speaking of them as tools that we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: to make new cultivars, but really like
preserving our history and our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it's this balance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so the breeding pipeline is to like
come up with amazing cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's the selection process really
does narrow down that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like really this is showing the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can see my pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that coming through?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the breeding is leading upwards,
but really like that's for, that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: poor design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, cause the breeding cycle is going
back through each layer and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in new traits and new, you know,
new to maintain this broad diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, no breeder worth his salt or
his or her salt is going to like breed
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves into a corner, especially for
apple breeding, which again, the
[SPEAKER_00]: generation time, like to be able to
intergress new, new traits and new,
[SPEAKER_00]: new germplasm is going to set you back
quite a, quite a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always be thinking like, how can I
maintain this while trying to achieve,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a broader and more, you know,
broad diversity and targeted releases for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for new cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, avoid the bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's really kind of evident here
when we do genetic studies of our apple
[SPEAKER_00]: collection, each line represents the first
degree relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in our diversity collection of
about 2000 apple accessions, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: how everything's kind of already
intermixed and somehow related to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apple, because of its biology really
retains a lot of diversity, but modern
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars really only have about eight,
like progenitors that is like the found,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the effective population for apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am part of the national plant
germplasm system, which is a USDA program
[SPEAKER_00]: that has about 20 sites throughout the U S
dedicated to crop conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva is unique because we are one of the
original four that started in the 1940s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Geneva here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll highlight, again, here's like the
overall holdings of the, the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: program, about 621,000 accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this isn't just like a cool
collection, like an arc that no one has
[SPEAKER_00]: access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like broadly accessible for
research and for breeding and for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 20, you know, quarter of a
million samples go out every year from our
[SPEAKER_00]: gene banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our simple mission of acquire,
preserve, characterize, and distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: these genetic resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love this quote by the geneticist
Francois Jacob, diversity is a way of
[SPEAKER_00]: coping with the possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It acts as a kind of insurance for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people get excited about talking
sustainability and how do we like
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve, you know, agriculture for the
future, that genetic diversity is a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of that solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our gene bank does look a lot different
than maybe what you've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know Denise, like has a lot of
experience working in like, in like the
[SPEAKER_00]: classic gene bank, but here is our gene
bank and it's really like not preserved at
[SPEAKER_00]: all, like not protected at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so we have deer issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have disease management problems just
because these are field-based collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we do have, you know,
a substantial diversity of apple and 56
[SPEAKER_00]: species with about 4,400 accessions in
there, making it one of like the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest and most diverse genetically in
the world, which is really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grape collection has about 30 species
with 1,400 accessions in the tart cherry,
[SPEAKER_00]: which again is like, it's small,
but it's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just kind of our numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned like the quarter of a million
distributed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geneva mostly was distributing apple for a
long time, like reaching about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 6,000 to 8,000 accessions a
year, samples a year that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-COVID, we've had some like pullback
just because we wanted to like focus our
[SPEAKER_00]: energy and making sure that that germplasm
is targeted for breeding and for
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's kind of the classic view of
like, this is a gene bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone recognize the one on the left?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Small bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small bar, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the doomsday vault, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a vault like this for our
vegetable and seed collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, I should mention as well,
is in a vault like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I mean by we need to
balance vulnerability and accessibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apples are easily, like the most,
the simplest way that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: propagated and traded apples over time and
preserved them is through clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep seeds all you want,
but if you want a clonally maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: line, like a pure honey crisp,
it's only through clonal propagation that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you want it accessible for
pollen and you want to do crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a tree, a mature tree living in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in 2020, we had an outbreak of fire
blight that really just devastated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each square here in the grid of our field
map represents an accession and the color
[SPEAKER_00]: indicates disease severity and purple
being the most severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of, there's a lot of purple
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at a time that like we were reduced
workforce because of COVID policies,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had this outbreak of fire blight,
which really was a challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, we got on the cover of agronomy
with one of our pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let's go through the collection and
just evaluate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like let's do a quantitative score of how
infected these trees are just by counting
[SPEAKER_00]: number of fresh and new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then taking account of how many
infected shoots and just giving kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rough percentage of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see quite a bit of broad variation
from 0%, which could be just a lucky
[SPEAKER_00]: escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I like this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 64% here and about 0.9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a high probability of tree C here
getting some disease pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not showing any signs of resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we map the results by
species, you see like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: domesticated apples have, you know,
kind of interesting broad range of no
[SPEAKER_00]: infection to heavy infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malciversia is the wild progenitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of makes sense for that one as
well to have a similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was June, July.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of those healthy trees
disappear as disease progresses and we
[SPEAKER_00]: start to capture more infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the wild species retain their
resistance to the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the challenge for us is
maintaining these collections is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing horticultural practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them developed at Cornell to
manage apples, but not diverse collections
[SPEAKER_00]: of apples where everything might bloom at
the same time or at a different time,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is critical for managing a disease
like fire blight or the response to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might be, sometimes we were doing
more damage than good by putting on
[SPEAKER_00]: certain applications of copper,
right, for example, or prohexadione,
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not each accession doesn't respond to the
effects of Apogee to reduce growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of limit the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a tightrope walk of
orchard management to like hold all these
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity collections, keep them all
together while managing all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know, challenges and
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of pruning and regeneration
happened during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our total was close to 3,000
individual trees were propagated and
[SPEAKER_00]: replanted, engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing so much better now with a
diverse management program, chemically,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's still an impact on fruit
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is where we don't rely on
commercial practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do things that like will sacrifice
fruit quality to maintain tree health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of the consequences is
like we'll see heavy russeting,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy splitting, which makes the fruit
kind of not useful for characterization,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a critical part of our mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these healthy trees,
right, like, or we have a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity collection that no one's
interested in using because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what we have, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but during this kind of heavy fire
blight time, we couldn't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization to take representative
images or get good fruit quality data from
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other kind of safety net that we
utilize heavily is cryopreservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apple is one of the easiest to
cryopreserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simple collecting dormant signwood
like you would right now for grafting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can dehydrate it and put it in
liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost the recovery is 80% to 90%
viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to manage and get your
diversity collections backed up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grape is a lot more challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't direct cryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a shoot tip and a droplet
vitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going into tissue culture, getting
droplets, freezing those, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing those out, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can imagine that the labor
intensive part is like kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottleneck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, clonal propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the coolest and most
ancient tools that we have, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: like dating back maybe 10,000 years of
people demonstrating this capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is likely how apples were taken
out of original forests and traded and
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to your backyard, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no more foraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have cultivars we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can put them right where we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, just in kind of a an example
of how we do grafting and propagation to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain our collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are examples from
cryopreservation, which you can see here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the rootstock, and then here's the
chit-butted accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, you'll get some growth,
and then you can trim back the rootstock
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a brand new accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's so cool about this is now you
have a timelessness to the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things that are hundreds of years
old or sometimes thousands of years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: they report some grapes dating back to
Roman periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roxbury Russet is a cool apple in our
accession because it represents the first
[SPEAKER_00]: true American apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this kind of wild triploid thing
that's not that tasty, but it's again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's part of American history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Montmorency dates back to the the pre 17th
century and represents the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar grown for tart cherry production
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our buddy Concord, right, like we love
this grape and its distinctiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is an old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's amazing is that you walk
into these collections and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were developed, you know,
within the last 10 years or like the last
[SPEAKER_00]: several hundred years in our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're intermixed with the wild
species as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of get this snapshot of all
the diversity in one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'll just walk through some of the
exciting, like I think they're exciting,
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization efforts that we're going
through right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, it's not enough to just
have these things be secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want people to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the limitations to people
having access is just they don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: we have or what would be interesting to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collecting phenotypic genetic data,
like getting that information out,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe it's got an interesting
pedigree or history, and that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tart cherry is kind of a nightmare,
though, genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tetraploid hybrid of a sweet
cherry and a wild European cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got this really interesting
anthocyanin profile that it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's the anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not just red, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a different profile which gives
it different chemical properties and
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishable through chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interesting that you can tell a
sweet from a tart just by its chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melatonin is reported high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of my white whales for
characterization because it's just such a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating compound to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank heavens that TikTok was saved,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know if you guys were
nervous about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how else would we have known about the
sleepy girl mocktail from tart cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: juice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a great use of social media to
promote a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go and look this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's a lot of interesting,
I don't know, anecdotal things that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: with our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sleepy girl mocktail highlights kind
of the sleepy benefits of tart cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: juice, which might be related to melatonin
or might be nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll investigate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool about tart cherry is that
they're kind of having a moment right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I would say like grandma drinks
prune juice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like your ultra marathon runner is
chugging down tart cherry juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like they have, like this is one
brand, like they've got the pit crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't want to be part of the pit
crew, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a great promotion of a
product and it gets it into diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just a $3 bottle of cherry
juice now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a $15 bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bottle of elite endurance juice,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like drink this if you want to gear up
for, I don't know, Marvin's seminar or
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe he's got a tough exam coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chug some tart cherry juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with the tart cherry
industry in the US is it's narrowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like precariously dependent on a
single cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you take any agriculture
class, you know that this is bad news and
[SPEAKER_00]: you shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wrote a fruit quarterly on like
let's move beyond Montmorency highlighting
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the interesting diversity within
the USDA collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highlight this again because you can
see the red is our tart cherry and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: very little attention compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's maybe a hundred million dollar
industry in the US on a good year compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to like the billions that grape and apple
bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the smallest crop,
but yeah, it could benefit from some
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've looked at phenological traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like bloom time alone sets back the
industry every couple of years just by a
[SPEAKER_00]: frost damage and ruining your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruit chemistry, I mentioned like
interesting phenolic profiles that like
[SPEAKER_00]: might be related to some of the
nutritional benefits of the juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just generic fruit descriptors
and images.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit weights, you know, looking at pit to
fruit ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can like kind of maximize fruit size
and not waste energy in a market on a
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This large, excessively large pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at tart cherry bloom phenology,
we do see some significant variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might be, this maybe represents a
month long span with the vertical line
[SPEAKER_00]: here representing Montmorency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's some extreme light
blooming beyond Montmorency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually we could do a lot worse
for New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where most of the production is is
in Michigan State, which they have maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: an even more volatile springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than we do some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's an article from 2012 when
I started at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wondered where we talk about tart
cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are all the tart cherries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there was a frost that year that
killed Michigan and Geneva's tart
[SPEAKER_00]: cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond just like looking at bloom
phenology, we can assay using differential
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal analysis that Jason Londo now at
Cornell is a specialist in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a three year evaluation of
64 tart cherry excessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at its cold hardy adaptation,
acclimation and deacclimation over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to like finally
summarize these results and get them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just some initial graphs, you can see
that each species and then within the
[SPEAKER_00]: species, there's variation for this trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again is going to hopefully help us
target climate specific cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's a new region that wants to
expand their cherry production,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it could be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like this image of tart cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because other crops have these beautiful
diversity displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like cherries kind of all really do look
pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's not a whole lot of
morphological or size variation that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's maybe a gap for us to fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each one of these box plots represents
a different trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see total soluble solids,
the sweetness, or its acidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: or its acid sugar ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one like Montmorency is kind of
on the low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low end for sweetness, but not bad for
its sugar acid ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is actually more important than the
total content to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just our perception of how sweet or
how acidic something is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is what sets back our whole
industry is the weight of Montmorency is
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's on the late blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conversion of an orchard or like
adoption of a new cultivar is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of indigent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like can we get the same fruit size,
the same dependence, like I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same quality from a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though if you look at the anthocyanin
profiles, which again is the new market
[SPEAKER_00]: for tart cherry juice is like high
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it tends to be on the low end for
almost every trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of chromatography nerds in our
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, sorry, apologize for the
excessive use of chromatograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's again the specific tart cherry
anthocyanin and then the sweet cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, here's a sweet cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's missing mostly this glucosal tinicide
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do see this kind of
interesting hybrid like ratio split
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, Montmorency kind of on the low
end for the content variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get really excited about flavor
and aroma diversity within the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So benzaldehyde is the classic cherry
compound that we associate with candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can fool us to thinking
something's almond as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's like some benzaldehyde results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see Montmorency kind of on the
low ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could really drive that cherry flavor
by using different diversity or for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was an interesting hybrid
accession with another wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has this more common grape
aromatic, linalool, which kind of is more
[SPEAKER_00]: floral in flavor and almost missing
benzaldehyde.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of see as you start to
profile like where you could push flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: in a breeding program or even just using
these as direct to market for an heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: production or for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so linalool content really is exciting
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seed friends in Geneva that do
a lot of seed analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use their equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a Marvin seed analyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw pits on and a whole fruit
because chairs are small enough and get
[SPEAKER_00]: circularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not spending a tremendous amount
of time kind of with calipers and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: these individual measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a nice higher throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic markers are invaluable,
but challenging to use for breeding just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the tetraploid nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see a clear split between the
sweet cherries in red, the tart cherries
[SPEAKER_00]: in black, and the progenitor fruticosa in
green here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some kind of interesting things that
are happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go too much into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the highlight, though,
of my career I think so far has been this
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery of Mount Vernon, the home of
George Washington, for the history buffs
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our founding fathers, the first
president of the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: they found cherry preserves during an
excavation of the basement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found initially one bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a phone call because they knew it
was cherries from the pit specimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you ignore that phone call?
[SPEAKER_00]: We went down immediately while they were
discovering bottles in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Tori and I there at the dig site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, everyone was screaming
out, oh, we found a bottle 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a thrilling Indiana Jones
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to unleash some curse or some
interesting horticultural artifact?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tori and I actually have the privilege
and honor now to be sifting through the
[SPEAKER_00]: contents of those bottles, pulling out pit
samples, which we can compare to modern
[SPEAKER_00]: pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, the pit seam and the pit
shape all kind of is indicative of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some stem fragments, which that's
amazing preservation for about 250 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kind of like a bottom or a top down
view of one of the bottles, which again,
[SPEAKER_00]: is like some of the fruit is still intact
and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've isolated DNA from them to compare to
a reference library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, super exciting to be able to
kind of bring to light, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a huge American story that we get
to be part of the telling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is moving on to grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grape is interesting because it's
split between two sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a tale of two collections,
one in Davis, California, one in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where you'd rather be today,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: California seems pretty nice minus the
horrible fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: So primarily, vinifera or the historic
European wine grapes, table grapes in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we specialize in cold hardy hybrids,
which again, we call it the cold hardy
[SPEAKER_00]: grape collection, but it's so much more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease resistance and flavor is what we
really should be promoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a large profiling of about
350 vinifera accessions and about 100 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid accessions from Geneva to look at
like anthocyanin profiles, which are huge
[SPEAKER_00]: for, again, nutritional content,
but now wine and table grape industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just a few of the interesting
profiles that come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all run with the same
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some anthocyanin rich,
some really anthocyanin poor accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in melon versus royalty and the
classic Merlot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like in the middle ground there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Papa Smurf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our workhorse LCMS in the lab
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when we look at total caftaric
acid, which is important acid in wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see again, some extreme with Merlot
being on the really low end and some
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting cultivars or accessions
on the high end, which some studies are
[SPEAKER_00]: showing caftaric acid associated with
other physiological traits, like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerance and some other things,
which will be kind of interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is with fruit, but what do leaves
look like as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, anthocyanins, the color of your
wine is so important, not just for like
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins, but for the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merlot is kind of, again, on the middle to
low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not of the box plot, but we do have some
really extreme high anthocyanin cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, these are just some interesting
stats from our diversity evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one cultivar royalty had 30 individual
anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, we talk about how do we diversify
the human diet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anthocyanin rich foods, but anthocyanin
diverse foods as well play a major role in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do solid phase micro-extraction or
SPME, which we're using a method developed
[SPEAKER_00]: by Gavin Sachs, the famous wine food
scientist here in Cornell, Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super, yeah, super low input
platform that gives us a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, here's our concord, our foxy
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to, all these purple
compounds are ones that are heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with the foxy aroma in grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can profile that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And muscat, I mentioned the linalool,
so muscat grapes have just such a
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive and lovely aroma, like a
French perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how else to describe them,
but better, but sweeter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to drink French perfume,
maybe, but these grapes really have such a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating flavor, mostly from linalool
and other monoterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's why I'm really excited
about our tart cherry that has more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: muscat grape profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, if we're looking at linalool
diversity, this one accession is really on
[SPEAKER_00]: the high end.
[SPEAKER_00]: July muscat for this narrow compound,
another similar, or muscat associated
[SPEAKER_00]: compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the challenges is the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the cold hardy grape
collection, which is more than cold hardy,
[SPEAKER_00]: full of hybrid grapes, which could be
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be domestic to wild, or wild to
wild, interspecific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just this nondescript term that
really makes it hard to leverage the power
[SPEAKER_00]: of the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have stout seedless,
which is 90% vinifera, and napka,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 10% vinifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grin in our database, they're both
called hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling out that information really
limits, like if you're searching just by
[SPEAKER_00]: taxonomy alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did ancestry estimations using PCA,
principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can give a percentage to how much
of one particular ancestor contributed to
[SPEAKER_00]: one or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have now kind of a continuous
variation from 0% vinifera to 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: vinifera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least that classification helps
bring to light some of the cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just, I always have to
highlight this, because Peter Cousins,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a longtime breeder for the USDA,
now at Gallo, has developed these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars from hybrid grapes in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like high disease resistance,
really interesting environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation, but also amazing fruit quality
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a kind of proof that you can take
something hybrid with a wild background
[SPEAKER_00]: and bring it into a more cultivated,
and not just serving New York industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but California industries as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the heart of the collection,
this is what I spent my PhD studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the apple collection and working with
Susan Brown, the apple breeder here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got several thousand accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about an apple a day,
this is almost 15 years of apples a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were to try one accession every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of endless joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that Wonka
Everlasting Gobstopper, you can just spend
[SPEAKER_00]: years searching the collection looking for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of showing our footprint of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really touched a lot of the major
apple production world in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are accessions that landed
somewhere internationally or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apple has an interesting
domestication, because we talk through
[SPEAKER_00]: grafting this instant domestication,
but apple itself is a hybrid between two
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this story has been retold and told so
many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I want to gloss over it,
though, someone, maybe Marvin in a tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, no, you got to tell the story
and have to go back and highlight that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really trading apples out of Kazakhstan
through Europe where it hybridized with a
[SPEAKER_00]: different apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this interspecific nature to
apple, which makes it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any guesses on which is the domesticated,
which is the wild, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top, middle, bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Middle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the Malis Tversi representatives
that we have in the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way to go, Hannah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this story really was famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Gennaro Fazio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this picture of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first curator for Apple,
Phil Forslund.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got the helicopter in to
Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: How cool is this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm talking Indiana Jones level,
like, just going into a basement and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at old bottles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they actually got a helicopter in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they collect fruit from the wild,
which is really cool and was popularized
[SPEAKER_00]: by Michael Pollan's The Botnia of Desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is showing, over time,
the growth of the apple collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, starting with a large
donation from Cornell, the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: program, a lot of wild material,
then huge amounts of Malis Tversi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wild progenitor of apple coming in in
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, it kind of has slowed down
to being more targeted for wild species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story really wasn't done being
told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we had strong genetic background and
genetic data, because what we thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: pure Malis Tversi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought back maybe 383 accessions
into the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: 151 only were pure, what we considered
pure species, pure Malis Tversi.
[SPEAKER_00]: 215 were admixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hybrid population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 17 were pure domestica in the
forests of Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, explain how that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So apples get around, and they're well
designed, even through propagation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to propagate themselves and just be
planted where maybe they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is kind of highlighting the
really, I don't know, the stress and
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of collecting wild apple today and
not waiting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there's an apple orchard down
the road, that pollen is going to admix
[SPEAKER_00]: into a wild population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of a few decades,
who knows what will be left of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genetics are secure with apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the purity of a species, if that's a
primary concern, is kind of a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's so cool about our story with Malis
Tversi, though, is all of this came out
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was still a mystery of who was the
wild progenitor of apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was germplasm found by the USDA and
brought here that has been now distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to Europe, back to Kazakhstan,
for repatriation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really that initial effort to
conserve Malis Tversi that gave us so much
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, yeah, it's a huge win for
our unit and the legacy of Phil Forslund
[SPEAKER_00]: and those herb aldwinkle, you have to
mention him as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, when we look at genetic
diversity, though, within the collection,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see a lot of clones, because a lot of
things have names, and the names change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we bring it in, not knowing that
it's actually identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the clones are like take up
space, but sometimes they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: useful, because you might have just single
mutation sports that maybe it's golden
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious with a new novel trait added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of is exciting for breeding,
because otherwise these cultivars are
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck without any kind of mutation,
just because they're fixed in time through
[SPEAKER_00]: colonal propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I have to show more
chromatograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought I was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is licorice flavor, estrogol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so apples, most people don't have this
familiarity with apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to an orchard late in the
summer, season, and harvest even a golden
[SPEAKER_00]: delicious, you'll get a bright licorice
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's dark, depending on if you hate
dark or if you hate licorice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a fascinating flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it adds to the diversity and
what consumers want in that novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the red flesh apples maybe had
their moment, and it's not that exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, because it didn't really bring a
lot of interesting flavor or interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love the element of surprise,
and just red flesh wears off pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But flavor, I think, is a powerful target
for modern apple breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha-farnesine is associated with some
disorders in post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can talk to Chris Watkins about
all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honeycrisp is one of the trouble
makers with some post-harvest disorders
[SPEAKER_00]: like scald.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alpha-farnesine is associated,
but I don't know if it's really clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this particular aroma is really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some estrogol, but low in this
particular sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to leave with some life advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you go, maybe you don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've tuned out apple, grape,
and tart cherry this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your thing is carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or berries, if smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just whatever trait, whatever crop
you're working on, just consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many studies that I read from a
curatorial or gene bank perspective fall
[SPEAKER_00]: short of what they could be had the
authors more carefully considered what
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that they were including in a
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can make huge progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the scientific discovery is limitless
when you're really working with a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But please, don't forget the silliness and
the joy of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason we're not in agriculture
and maybe growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason we picked horticulture as
opposed to running a combine 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a joy in what we can bring in new
fruit flavors and diversity to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please come see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The apple and grape tour is in the fall,
usually associated with the plant breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: tour, if you're within that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the tart cherry tour is maybe
mid-July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked a firm date, and then all the
cherries ripened before that date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so stay tuned for maybe a more updated
tour date for the tart cherries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have to acknowledge, yeah, wonderful
colleagues at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic team with the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will leave some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, I have a question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said Montmorency has been around
for, like, 400 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the industry's really locked into
that variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you did come up with something and a
group came up with something that was even
[SPEAKER_03]: better, and maybe they already have,
would the industry adopt it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they so stuck on Montmorency that
you're just not going to change?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to Amy Izzoni, who was the- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Marvin's question was like,
OK, Montmorency is old news.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe something interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the likelihood for an industry to
adopt that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Amy Izzoni at Michigan State
University, a longtime breeder for root
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks and advocate for new tart cherries,
like, had some success in getting balaton
[SPEAKER_00]: and other kind of heirloom land race
cultivars into production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just strong resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, again, if there's just
the risk of it's already such a small
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the extra effort to go to a new
cultivar is just not worth that to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it just needs maybe a few more
crop failures through frost damage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's an easy one to overcome
with some of the diversity that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just bloom late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bloom a week later, and you've saved
yourself an entire loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't know what holds back
industry from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just out of curiosity, a little while ago,
we had an email exchange about the apples
[SPEAKER_02]: of New York volume one, volume two.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many of those apples have been saved?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or has the majority of them been lost to
history?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris is referencing, and maybe you
shouldn't broadcast this, that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the apples of New York books, volume one
and two, which, again, careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no break-ins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the early 1900s, published these
apples of New York's book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never looked through it to see how
many are in there and how many would cross
[SPEAKER_00]: reference back to the collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been reported that there are tens
of thousands of apple cultivars that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been named that were at one time in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether those were synonyms,
pseudonyms, same name, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how many of those actually exist today
in the collection?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of hard to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't necessarily want all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, we had that hit that
acquisition phase, and we filled the
[SPEAKER_00]: acreage pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's really targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want proof that it's something really
interesting genetically, or culturally
[SPEAKER_00]: important, or a wild accession that
deserves that spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, yeah, we're happy to work with
partners like Seed Savers, or other
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage groups to conserve those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is quite an heirloom hobby
enthusiast group for apple that's out
[SPEAKER_00]: there chasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll read about it in the news,
the lost apple groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for something like apple,
where the center of origin is overseas,
[SPEAKER_01]: for germplasm, you can't shove seeds in
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that you should do that anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you obviously, is it through
university researchers, you exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there similar germplasm collections
overseas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a diplomacy thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there are international treaties
that we're a part of that allow for that
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange through a shared material
transfer agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, above board, we're not going in
and taking anything that doesn't belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making sure that countries that have
the germplasm maintain that ownership of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With apple, and with grape, and tart
cherries, it's challenging because of
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses to import.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do have APHIS, the Animal Plant
and Health Inspection Service,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a quarantine site that specializes in
palm fruits and stone fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can go through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, from those 90s explorations,
there's still a malice saversii in
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine that still has viruses that
just will not get cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 30 years now in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pipeline now with genetic tools and
screening for viruses can streamline that
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, so you can get it quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process for importation is a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, when you get a chance
to check with GMU, see if GMU has a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so Ira, who is a new postdoc with the
Grape Genetics Research Unit, asked about
[SPEAKER_00]: PCA ancestry for grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if it works for different
ploidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I assume that it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to capture that and
intelligibly, just looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: principal component analysis, say that
these results match what we know about
[SPEAKER_00]: these accessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe there's some flaw in doing the
quantification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll chat, Ira.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have interrupted the question that
was about to be asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill, can I ask you a question?
Hello?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is Larry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great talk, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a very quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw you have a 20k SNP chip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious, all the genotyping that
you've done on Apple, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: was that based on a SNP array?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or what are your favorite genotyping
methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the SNP array is phasing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was developed for commercial
apples, or domesticated apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it falls short for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start looking at hybrids or
wild, we've used a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience has been more with
genotyping by sequencing, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, every platform is flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one, at least, can account for
different genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's updatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as new genome references come out,
or you have a new wild accession that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know where it fits, that's been
really helpful in elucidating
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaborators now are just going for full
genome sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that'll probably be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think disentangling the pedigrees of
Apple, the SNP array, and just its
[SPEAKER_00]: reliability for the domesticated has been
really helpful for that data set.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm supposing what you distribute from the
center varies, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: In some cases, it might be seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other cases, it could be wood.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we distribute?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's primarily scion wood, because people
want to propagate an accession,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pollen as well, or fruit samples for
different studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, not so much, unless they're for
wild, just because people want to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: that genetic integrity of their accession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are nice because, well, in theory,
we can trade them more easily because of
[SPEAKER_00]: virus issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know some recent research at Cornell
Agritech has kind of made us question
[SPEAKER_00]: that, whether it's truly virus-free
through seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
