[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome everybody to the Cornell
hemp field days.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jacob Toth and I'm a PhD
candidate in Larry's smart lab and today
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be talking about molecular breeding
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my talk today I'll be discussing some
of the theory and ideas behind molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding of hemp and give an example of
how we're using molecular breeding in our
[SPEAKER_00]: research program to develop a high
yielding fiber cultivar that has low
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of phc to stay compliant as well as
produce high levels of cbd.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to recognize the
contribution of genetics and environment
[SPEAKER_00]: to your trade of interest for any breeding
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the plant grows, the phenotype,
is the result of both the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as well as the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics of the plant, also known as
the genotype, refers to the DNA of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the genes and other DNA which make
up the plant's genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many important traits such as yield are
heavily influenced by both the genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment, but some traits such
as photoperiod dependence and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidotype are heavily influenced by
genotype alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concerning photoperiod dependence,
if you look at this picture here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the small plant is photoperiod independent
and started flowering almost immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: after planting, while the larger plant,
which is photoperiod dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't start flowering until the night
length hit a certain threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another important trait that is
influenced heavily by genotype in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is cannabinoid type, and breeding for
cannabinoid type is a fundamental part of
[SPEAKER_00]: any hemp breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is molecular breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in molecular breeding, very broadly,
instead of just looking at the phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, which is the result of both
the genotype and the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at the actual DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So advances in molecular biology have
allowed much easier analysis of DNA,
[SPEAKER_00]: and because the DNA is the same in every
cell of a plant, whether it's young or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's old, being able to assay a
plant just by looking at the DNA allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to look at certain traits before
they're even expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, to determine if a plant is
going to be male or female, or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to produce mostly THC or mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with molecular breeding, you can
develop new cultivars based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype alone, and when done accurately,
this can result in less expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping and ultimately reducing the
cost and reducing the time it takes to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a new cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit about
how our research group is using molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding to develop new, elite,
high-yielding fiber cultivars that have
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, we grew several varieties for
grain and fiber production, including two
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars from China called Dama and Puma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know much about these cultivars
when we first planted them, aside from a
[SPEAKER_00]: little blurb for Puma, which claimed to
have high CBD seeds, high leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers output.
[SPEAKER_00]: When these plants were grown, we were
quite impressed by the plants in that they
[SPEAKER_00]: had extremely large leaves and extremely
fast growth rate and would routinely hit
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we harvested these plants and readed
them to measure the fiber yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that Dama and Puma had nearly
double the biomass yield of other elite
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars grown for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, we thought that Dama and
Puma would make excellent fiber cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when we looked at the
cannabinoids, we found that both Puma and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dama produced THC at levels exceeding 0.3%
and would be non-compliant in the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked further at the cannabinoids that
Puma and Dama were producing and we found
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were relatively high in
cannabinoids, with Puma producing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: over 1.5% total cannabinoids and Dama
sometimes exceeding 2% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is considerably higher than what
other fiber cultivars produced in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, we sampled these plants when
they were just starting to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we hypothesized that as the plant
became more mature, the total cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: would increase even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the big problem was that Puma and
Dama produced THC as a major cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, what we would like in a
cultivar would be something that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: as much dry biomass as Puma and Dama,
but instead of producing THC, produces
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to achieve that goal, we turned to
molecular breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to understand what we did for molecular
breeding, it's first important to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the different chemotypes that
are found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three important chemotypes
that I'll talk about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's type one, which is mostly THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's type two, which is CBD to THC at
about a two to one ratio, but this number
[SPEAKER_00]: can vary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's type three, which
produces mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing a population or a
cultivar for CBD, you'd expect all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to be type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2018 and 2019, we found that some
of the plants that we were growing were in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact type two or even type one,
producing almost no CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this data and this figure in the top
here shows data from 2018, we developed a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecular marker, which looks at the DNA
of the plants and can distinguish type one
[SPEAKER_00]: from type two and type three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to Dama and Puma,
when we were looking at the THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio for these plants, we saw that it was
about a two to one ratio of CBD to THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would suggest that most of the
plants that we were sampling were type
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an interesting thing about these type
two plants is that they won't breed true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a population which is freely
intercrossing with a lot of these type two
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you'd expect to see a certain
number to be type one and a certain number
[SPEAKER_00]: to be type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have the HPLC, the chemical
data on a lot of different plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: Dama and Puma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just looking at pooled samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could apply this molecular marker
to these populations and distinguish the
[SPEAKER_00]: different plants that were in these
different chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So late last year, around December,
we grew about a hundred plants each of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dama and Puma and tested them with this
marker that we developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as expected, we found that about half
of the plants were type two and we found
[SPEAKER_00]: that about a third of the plants were type
three and then the remainder were type
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we selected the type
three and in theory, these plants should
[SPEAKER_00]: form an excellent basis for a high
producing fiber cultivar that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, after selection of these type
three plants, we run into a few problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with their propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants, which are so vigorous in
the field, are also very vigorous in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and they grew extremely fast
and extremely tall, sometimes an axis of
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were also quite susceptible to
various greenhouse pathogens such as
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make matters worse, they appear to be
very photoperiod dependent and did not
[SPEAKER_00]: flower in the greenhouse in the spring
when we were growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were also some issues with cutting
propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants form a very nice single stem,
as you can see in this photo here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not always simple to take a
cutting and root that very nice stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to address this, we're attempting to
grow the plants in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've planted them out and hopefully we'll
harvest some grain at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, which will form a good basis for
scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also sent the cuttings of these
plants to a collaborator in Florida who
[SPEAKER_00]: should be able to grow the plants without
any issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summary, molecular breeding involves
selection on the genotype on the DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bauma and Puma, two cultivars from China,
are high biomass producers, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: produce high non-compliant levels of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection in Bauma and Puma for chemotype
three plants using a molecular marker
[SPEAKER_00]: should produce a high yielding and
compliant thyroid cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants here are growing in the field
in New York should form the basis of a new
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant fiber cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to harvest the seeds at the end of
the season, scale them up, ensure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: resulted plants have the same biomass
potential as the parent Bauma and Puma
[SPEAKER_00]: populations, and eventually potentially
release new cultivars.
Thank you.
