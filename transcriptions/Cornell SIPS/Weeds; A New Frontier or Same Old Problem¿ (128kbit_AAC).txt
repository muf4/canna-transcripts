[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I'm going to talk about one of our
most favorite plant types today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I go through this, what I'm going
to try and get you to do is to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to put some things on here
that basically might change your thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: might solidify your thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want you to think more broadly about
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of this has to do
with some of our preconceived ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some of the things that we've
learned over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will just get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might be familiar to some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this guy out here, he's not real old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's laying down on the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see he's quite frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And asking him about this new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same old thing that I've been
doing for the past few years of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our attitude towards weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've put this into, I'm just giving
broad terms to conventional thinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are not good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just how we sometimes tend to
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conventional type systems,
typically you want 100% weed free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that they negatively compete with
available resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eliminating weeds is number one
priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously there's a relationship with
economic losses associated with those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more sustainable systems or sustainable
thinking, often it's density thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many weeds are out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get by with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they really having an impact that
I need to work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also plant diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking more broadly, these are
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adding diversity to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also are they providing an alternative
cover, whether it's a mulch, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something else that allows them to remain
in these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the impacts of weeds through the
literature, various studies, good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is somewhat conflicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's based on your thinking and
what you're geared toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can think of weeds as either they
compete for resources or they contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to resources through biomass or competing
for available resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: They inhibit or assist operations,
whether that's harvest, clogging up your
[SPEAKER_00]: harvester or providing a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harbor insects and diseases are support
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase agronomic biodiversity,
but maybe lower diversity in our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, where you see invasive plants
becoming monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of this biodiversity issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also increase production costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we increasing the environmental
benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of a weed as a plant that has
some desirable characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bit of a conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's been resolved
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we look back, so historically we're
looking back because we want to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: have we gone through?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have we worked on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So weed is defined as a plant out of
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of you have heard that
definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ralph Waldo Emerson is defined as a
plant whose virtues have not yet been
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of looking at the glass as half
empty, he's looking at it as half full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time, now I've put this time scale
back in the early days all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that, and this is
basically relating to weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we had the firsthand implements,
then we get into horse drawn, mechanical,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical era begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the first herbicide or the 2,4-D
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some internet was invented in 1973.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, why is that important to weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll get into that as far as
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the first herbicide resistant
ryegrass resistant to seven sites of
[SPEAKER_00]: actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're familiar with the herbicide
resistance scenario or issue, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: different sites of actions with the
different modes of actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ryegrass here is pretty major.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this occurred in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at certified organic systems,
it was certified in the US in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: The executive order, everyone's familiar
with the Clinton era when they declared
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive species as something that we need
to start managing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they made it an executive order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have climate hubs developed in
2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most recent research that I've
seen is the development of an automated
[SPEAKER_00]: weeder by some folks at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of some of the events
that contribute to what I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to those changes,
we've also had ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theory has advanced over that same
time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also seen some practical
application in our management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's changed, whether we're talking
about hand implements all the way up to an
automated weeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing a lot of changes over time
that I think also contribute to our
[SPEAKER_00]: viewpoint and our thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But weeds in ecosystems, they're either
resilient or they're pesky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is based on kind of perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in these natural ecosystems,
semi-natural or urban ecosystems,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds tend to be survivors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very prolific in either producing
seed or producing biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, you could view them as
opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look for niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm giving them kind of human
qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But niches are what they take advantage
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what we see,
especially when you look at a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our managed systems, there's a lot of
disturbance going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's opportunities that are created
for weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about kind of three
main areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is related to the things that I
have done research on or what my interests
[SPEAKER_00]: were prior to coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to just talk about these
three things just to get us thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: more broadly as far as weeds and invasive
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So superweeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now superweeds is a very, it kind of gets
your attention, whether it's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: emotional level or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably seen it in the popular
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Associated with genetically modified
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this article by Kogan in 2005 talked
about superweeds are impossible to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're impossible to kill if you're
using one herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's glyphosate, you're going to
have a glyphosate-resistant gene that's
[SPEAKER_00]: either transferred to the weed or the
indiscriminate spraying of glyphosate onto
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant GM crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically providing selection
pressure to allow for a resistant weedy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So herbicide-resistant, are they really
superweeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you've seen this graph,
but this is from Ian Heap and his Weed
[SPEAKER_00]: Science website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we've seen a dramatic increase
in herbicide-resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who don't know,
Palmer amaranth in the south in cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: fields has been a huge issue for them to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually forced some growers to
even go out of growing cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a nice poster child of
herbicide-resistant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these characteristics contribute to
its success in these cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take you through a time
lapse, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1989, the first Palmer amaranth
resistance was identified in Tennessee and
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia, if my geography is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So South Carolina, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get to Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1995,
1997, 1998, 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just going to go right ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that continually we're
seeing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is from the herbicide
resistance website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see that in each of these
states, at least one individual or one
[SPEAKER_00]: population has been identified resistance
to herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to be just uniform
resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to shift gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the resistance issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, in my work, I was especially
interested in extreme events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing, especially in the
Midwest, was significant drought and
[SPEAKER_00]: significant impacts of drought on cropping
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's still a lot of work on
developing drought-tolerant crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corn, soybeans, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for what I know, there's not a real
interest or there's not a lot of work in
[SPEAKER_00]: drought-tolerant weeds or invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know Tony has written some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some folks that are working on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the real focused effort,
it's not a lot of work has been done on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to kind of define it,
it's a delay in lethal dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, it's related to the physiology or
morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a phenotypic plasticity where
the plant either uses less water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it loses less water, or it gains access to
water through root penetration through the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the genetic
adaptation where, over time, if there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another selection pressure that is
creating a change in the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this depends a lot on the intensity
and duration of that selection pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I indicated, in 2012, we saw this
chart from the US Drought Monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this central part of the country was
either red or brown for most of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at Phragmites australis,
which I think you folks have some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But looking at Phragmites common reed and
its tolerance to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a greenhouse study we set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we had these large tanks where
we transplanted Phragmites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we exposed them to different
stress periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, we had a low stress,
medium stress, and severe stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, that was related to the
number of days that there was no water in
[SPEAKER_00]: those mesocosms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for our lowest stress, we had 19
days of no water, which, in addition,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were four days where it was at
greater than 80% available water was
[SPEAKER_00]: depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting down to very,
very dry conditions, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our medium stress was 36 days with
no water, 20 days at greater than 80%,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then our severe stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a month of no water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of that 60 days, there were about
44 days where it was significantly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: In our lowest stress treatment,
this is day 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on day 70, we added water back into
those tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at this, we could say,
well, that plant is either dead or it has
[SPEAKER_00]: gone dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was actually dormant because 25
days post-drought, it had started to green
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just the low stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was convinced that the severe stress,
we'd killed those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, they're dead, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not the case because 25 days later,
those plants were starting to green up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can ask, well, did you get all the
water out of that soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had soil moisture sensors that were
basically reading zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there probably could have been
pockets of water in those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very much an indication that this
plant is very tolerant to drought
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe some of you are familiar with
that or have worked on this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shifting gears a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardus nutans, which is musticil,
we looked at an invasion study into cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and warm season perennial grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had simulated grazing for two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also introduced musticil in the first
year, in the spring of the first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of this study was very
interesting in that we had normal
[SPEAKER_00]: precipitation one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went into our drought year in
2012, which was the worst drought that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've had on record.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really nice for our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrible for people that were
cropping and that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it worked out really well for us to
compare that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to go right to the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, along the x-axis here is
the dates, so April 2011, all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: to November 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's our volumetric water
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: These represent the various treatments,
whether it was bare ground, musticil by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, warm season grazed, warm season
non-grazed, cool season grazed,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool season non-grazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically this shows you that in the
second year where we had our musticil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I realize these lines are not really
easy for you to see, but where there was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically non-grazing, so our non-graze
treatments, there was water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where we had our musticil and anything
where there was grazing, if I'm reading
[SPEAKER_00]: that right, had depleted water down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a difference in water content
between these two treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really great graph,
especially if you're tired and you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to sleep really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pardon me for the busyness,
but along here, these are all our
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is basically looking at light
penetration into the canopy over May,
[SPEAKER_00]: June, July, and August of 2011,
and then the same thing in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to highlight is at the
initial part of our study, we had good
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see a high bar, that means
there's a lot of light penetrating into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see bars that are low, that means
there's not a lot of light reaching the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at, and I'm just going to point
out these two treatments are warm season
[SPEAKER_00]: non-grazed musticil, where we added it,
and warm season where we just added
[SPEAKER_00]: musticil by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, warm season non-graze without
musticil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see in 2011, it's doing a good
job at shading out the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2012, now these are perennial
grasses, they should be growing robustly,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing some good shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, the drought was affecting these
grasses where they had now were allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: light to penetrate the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you say, well, why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for musticil, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it gets access to light with
enough soil moisture, it grows very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just looking at populations over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2011, 2012, I'm just highlighting
this, our warm season non-grazed where we
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced musticil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here early on, it started
to establish, but then in August,
[SPEAKER_00]: it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in 2012, it started to
establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: By July, those plants were dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011, we had great soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had normal precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had very nice establishment of musticil
in our grazed treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our non-grazed plots in 2012,
this is basically musticil emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would die without producing a
flower or any kind of seed head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for comparison, here's our
beautiful bare ground plots of musticil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we did get a lot of attention by
people driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is right by a highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would drive by and say,
you need to control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a noxious weed, and we were
trying to do research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bagged all the seed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to let you know, we didn't let all
the seed go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were bagging the seed heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second year, we chopped all
this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did actually get a chance to operate
a shovel and take care of any remaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a little bit of an
introduction of where we're seeing this
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance or not tolerating these dry
drought conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does tolerance or resistance make it
super?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we also know that there's weeds that
are tolerant to mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tolerant to disking or
disturbances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really dependent on intensity and
duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not super, but they're actually
resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenologically or genetically,
it adapts to environmental stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether an example is drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are able to evolve as far as
their defense mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an example of herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also able to access spatial
temporal resources, whether that's light
[SPEAKER_00]: water nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm saying this related to weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they're just plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not some formidable foe that we
can't really deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about that at the end as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bioenergy, we're going to shift gears
here a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioenergy research, this is just a map of
where some of the regional projects have
[SPEAKER_00]: been conducted across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little bit dated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really up to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to show you, and I think everyone
is aware of the bioenergy research that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, there's several resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several things that folks are
looking at, obviously corn, corn residue,
[SPEAKER_00]: switchgrass, perennial grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some interest in miscanthus,
gigantus, biodiesel, soybeans,
[SPEAKER_00]: canola, camela, camelina, and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out, even within this
group, there's folks looking at grass
[SPEAKER_00]: bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also been some interest in
invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at these three photos,
you can see that there's high amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big interest, is how can we
create a lot of biomass to create ethanol
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide some fuel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like we discussed for Palmer,
invasive plants have some similar
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fast growing, high biomass,
relatively few pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create these dense monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's few inputs to kind of keep
them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the flip side of that, that is a
great scenario for invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of potential with these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are already doing their invasive
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed risk assessments, is anyone
familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed risk assessment, so assessing a plant
for its invasive or its ability to become
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these assessments on these plants
are positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're highly problematic, or they could
be highly problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure reviewed position papers,
these are just two of many papers that
[SPEAKER_00]: have opposed this kind of use of these
invasive plants, as well as public land
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you say, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use these for bioenergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a thing that we're always
managing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somehow you want to protect that
to create a fuel source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a new approach, I think,
is important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this gets back to how do we think
about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're harvesting existing
populations, and the focus is on control
[SPEAKER_00]: and restoration, I think it's a little bit
different scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if we can co-mingle these
sources with other resources, you address
[SPEAKER_00]: the sustainability issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a paper in Frontiers in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically looked at bioenergy that
sports ecological restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were focused on these two
invasive plants, Russian olive and
[SPEAKER_00]: tamarisk in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a 52-acre restoration site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all modeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did this by modeling, so it wasn't an
actual field study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they looked at all the available
tamarisk, Russian olive, kind of assessed
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass, and found out that there was
a significant amount that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they estimated for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they compared their data to national
estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, what they came up with was
that they said they could expand
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration activities and biomass
supplies, which would then create revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it would be supported by revenues
from the sale of the invasive tree wood
[SPEAKER_00]: waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you're supporting that
restoration effort by the sale of the
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to create this system
that supports itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd already been thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've submitted numerous proposals with
other colleagues, different disciplines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just an example of some of the proposals
we submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've submitted to numerous funding
sources, requesting up to $15 million with
[SPEAKER_00]: zero funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone is interested in this,
if you want to pursue this, I'd be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just realize what you're up against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you some of the
barriers of why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an ideological, how are we
thinking about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's environmental risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know that there's a weed risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're transporting this
stuff, there's potential that,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you could distribute it in the pathway
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economical, I've run into this over and
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we harvested everything, there wouldn't
be enough to supply the energy needs that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a particularly energy dense
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's social issues, the conflicting of
national agendas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Department of Energy says,
hey, grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet the USDA says, no, we need to control
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to go to them and propose
something when there's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement between agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going through all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having this really good discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, the invasive plants
continue to spread, because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really care what we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just some ideas that I've been
thinking about and working on when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in my previous location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing I want to talk about is
automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to preface that, so in
agriculture, I looked at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: trends that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that land use in ag has
dropped from 54% to 51%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of holding steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labor declined 30%, while agricultural
productivity increased 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger farms, 97% family owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm not going to question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a report by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing I want to really point out
here is the increased adoption of new
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what we're seeing in
some of our cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, we've got these
challenges that we're trying to address,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they're limited resources,
water, nutrients, energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have conditions that continually we're
dealing with, whether they're pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disasters, and now we're seeing climate
change, extreme events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also challenges to innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The application, logistics, as well as the
one we always like to work on is funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the available?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the technology that's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the new thing that is on the
horizon or actually being developed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in our human health system,
our human health area, they now have
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras that you can actually swallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can look inside you, find
different things that are right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can unlock your car from space now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all gone through this one,
where you're going through the airport and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can see everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one, they can determine if
you've washed your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've washed your hands, because
they're sensors that show what's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be beneficial if you have a
two or three year old and you tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do and they don't always do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here is the one for all you
gamers out there that just like to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these games are getting real
interactive and you can actually play
[SPEAKER_00]: across geographic locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the kind of technology that
probably is nothing new to a lot of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even other things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just thought a new biology for the
21st century, they point out that
[SPEAKER_00]: computational sciences and engineers are
part of this biological research that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, this emerging trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a quote from Bill Gates back
in 2008 on the special edition on
[SPEAKER_00]: robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically says, when or even if this
industry robotics will achieve critical
[SPEAKER_00]: mass, if it does, it may well change the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're six years later and I think
we're seeing some of those changes even
[SPEAKER_00]: within our cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's John Reed, Director of Production
Technology at John Deere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying that opportunities to
follow a different path to higher
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity, one that involves automation
control and robotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've seen their 48 row planter,
but they're also looking at very small
[SPEAKER_00]: individual robots that move in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an area that these companies
are looking at as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the idea with this automation
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we've got weeds in our cropping
system, we want to produce this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to support these people,
but we also want to maintain our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resources, our economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't necessarily want to revert to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we do all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we use automation to help in this
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we talk about integrated weed
management, a lot of treatment factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that contribute to the decisions that need
to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go into detail on
these, but selection method, application
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, timing, plant conditions,
environmental conditions, these are some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the factors that are considered in
integrated weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you think about, well,
if we're talking automation, we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: machine factors that include logistics,
if we're working in real time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also guidance, if you're talking
about something that's autonomous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So targeted recognition and application
systems actually are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to show you some examples of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the literature on
engineering, they're really working in
[SPEAKER_00]: this weed science area, more than maybe
some of the weed scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a real opportunity for
overlap or collaboration between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we talk about the spatial temporal
identification and management of weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically predicting where the weeds are
based on environmental factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really good at predicting,
not always, versus treatable based on
[SPEAKER_00]: location and plant characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to focus on this one just in
the next few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on location, so locating the
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been work done,
where are weeds in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go through and do it by hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do it with sensors or computers?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can create these maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a comparison of maps created
either by manual weed mapping,
[SPEAKER_00]: so going out and mapping those by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Semi-automated weed mapping, kind of a
hybrid between hand by hand versus using
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on automated weed mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that they're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some relationship there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was the weed density,
in most cases, the difference was due to
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf occlusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you've got overlapping weeds,
it's hard for the technology to identify,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, this is a weed and this is separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks at it as one weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the issue with why
there's not a real nice relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look in the field, where are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about plant characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we look at some of the characteristics
of the plant to help us identify?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this early work was back in the 1980s,
looking at sunflowers and soybeans and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically looking at near infrared
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, we've advanced from that
point on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early 1990s, they've developed
these commercial spot sprayers,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically looking at if there's green
foliage or brown soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the green comes up, that's an
indication to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're getting beyond that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting to where we've got a
knowledge-based machine vision system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of based on these
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could view this as a decision support
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But visually, finding where the plants
are, and then through a series of steps,
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying those plants, and then even
going to the species classification and
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can develop a weed map that's
very specific and allows us to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: This right here is the hard part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting to individual leaflets,
looking at leaf shape, venation texture
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, species classification,
this is the problem with this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the Norwegian Crop Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tried to do some of this work,
looking at plant canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plant canopie that was
photographed and doing this on the go as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a stop view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a real-time system,
because trying to get this to a practical
[SPEAKER_00]: application is going to require us to go
at a certain speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a knowledge-based machine
system and application system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, the work by the group
at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, this schematic shows you
that traveling in this direction with this
[SPEAKER_00]: camera, image processing computer,
and then connecting it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: microcontroller where, OK, we've
identified the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now can we spray those based on the
information that we collected going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've showed some success,
especially where they can distinguish
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato from night shade and pigweed
foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, it's very rudimentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're really making some good,
nice progress in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's another, again, looking at the
shape, but also now adding the visual
[SPEAKER_00]: color, looking at what are the differences
in the color of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To help us identify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most recently, this group has been
awarded a grant to look at doing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they said here is modifying the color
of that plant to then allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate between the weeds and the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what effect is that going to have on
the production of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yet to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just changing this color using,
in this case, a gene, that could be a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to help kind of identify our desirable
plants versus weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true integrated weed management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have an opportunity to actually
pursue this now that we have technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have sensors that can locate
individual weeds in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds can be identified based on their
characteristics or using a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the decision support system
determines the best treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the part that is important is we're
working at the micro scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, a little bit of a
conceptual challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not for a field that's just
loaded with weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the intent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intent is where you've got some weed
management challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have a robotic system go
through, identify where the weeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a known herbicide resistant
weed, that computer can identify it and
[SPEAKER_00]: apply a different treatment, whether it's
a cutting treatment, a burning treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it has to be at the micro dose
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So advanced technology can't account for
spatial temporal variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we have all tools on board,
they're available at any time and any
[SPEAKER_00]: location in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're bringing integrated weed
management to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not waiting for different seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not rotating crops, not that you
shouldn't be doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those tools are there in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conception to the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a swarm technology right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if some of you have heard
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these individual kind of spider
looking robots that kind of move
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a little area that they
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also some of these automated
machines that they're looking at where the
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have actuators that move
within the row.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are used in row crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question, are we still at research
grade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we still are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some startup companies in
California that are actually working in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually making some really
nice advances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I think we're still kind
of looking at, OK, how do we make this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we do it efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to wrap up here with
just some final thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what was needed is kind of a
merging of attitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not an e-merging, but merging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what type of thinking do we need to
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really think it's conventional
or sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's outside the box thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just a different approach and be
thinking broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like our second photograph where the
young man was thinking, are you kidding
[SPEAKER_00]: me?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a new frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think our mindset needs to change
about, how do we view weeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we need to be thinking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeds are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some happen to be very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we learn from those plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are managing weeds, when is it necessary
for complete control as compared to when
[SPEAKER_00]: can we use thresholds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a time when we can allow weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it always have to be annihilated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced technology is part of our
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we enhance our tools in the
integrated weed management toolbox?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of those things are up and
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even other things that I
didn't mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that weeds are ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ecosystem services are some weeds
providing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can those services, not the weeds,
be exploited?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we, if they're here,
we're dealing with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there some ways that we can actually
incorporate them into our system in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't become detrimental to our
economics and our environment in other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have maybe a few minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of the things that I was
working on before I left UNL was training
[SPEAKER_00]: livestock to eat invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a person in Colorado,
and maybe some of you are familiar,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she has trained cows to eat weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google it and you'll bring up her
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Nebraska, beef is like the number
one commodity in animal systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've already got them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't you just train them to eat the
things that you don't want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she showed that you could do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not as simple as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a very good idea, whether it's
genetically modifying them or just
[SPEAKER_00]: training them to eat these plants that we
don't necessarily want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good segue to my presentation
that I will be giving in a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Department of Natural Resources on
invasive plants and ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was at UNL, I had to basically
balance agronomic weeds, invasive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of generalized for this
audience, it's the agronomic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the invasive plants, obviously,
like you said, they're less intensively
[SPEAKER_00]: managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we address that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a conversation with the two
carries before I got in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we say, OK, am I making any
difference here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I making any progress, especially at
large scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where it really comes
down to defining what your goals are,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when we talk to land managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a problem across your entire
landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have patches?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have satellite populations where
you can focus on those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where we're really
looking at removing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets back to that restoration study
by the folks in frontiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's maybe an equally as large or
bigger question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, time's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's thank Steve once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
