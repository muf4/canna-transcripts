[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually thought this was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people investing a lot of money in
dealing with algae and weed management,
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation management, which sort of
starts with algal developments in many
[SPEAKER_01]: ways, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shading things out and causing other
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the use of barley straw is pretty
common now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this was pioneered, man,
many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raka Swad did this work in his younger
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nebraska, it looks like when the water
temperature gets to about 55 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: you put this barley straw right at the
inlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are chemicals that are eluted from
the straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly haven't looked at the science
of this at all, but I do know it is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: widely used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you consider what's
involved in putting one of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for lack of a better term,
wedding venue fountains in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_01]: golf course, more guys are going to the
bubblers that are a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's lots of solutions,
but this is a pretty simple one that even
[SPEAKER_01]: gets used at a swanky place like Jim's got
there at Fairview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, always thinking about fun things
around golf courses and really love this
[SPEAKER_01]: sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to play a couple of weeks ago and I
got to tell you, when you play in a
[SPEAKER_01]: scramble and you're a lousy golfer,
it gives you all these feelings because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to sweat your crappy shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, as soon as you hit a crappy shot,
you're happy to support the other crappy
[SPEAKER_01]: golfer you're playing with who might on
the off chance hit a good shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you approach a round of
golf like that, you know, I think it tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to be just a little bit more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've talked about in previous
episodes, the fun coming out of golf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just had this real thing about dogs
and wet dogs and dogs that are out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, people want to know why
their cars smell like wet, sappy dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know what this is,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Tim Gravert out in Iowa,
you know, everybody's in for rain and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave you that look like,
what are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get me out of this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dogs have a way of communicating those
feelings just by their looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Carl, you had something to say about
something I mentioned last week on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually thought it was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't you take us through this
urban nutrient management stuff we've
[SPEAKER_01]: worked on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about the
backstory of how this document came to be
[SPEAKER_00]: and sort of continue on from some of our
thoughts last week, which is about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we talked about fertilization,
soil test, MLSN.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mentioned this urban nutrient
management plan, which sort of codifies
[SPEAKER_00]: some best practices around how we use that
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it comes back to is not so
much turf grass quality, but water
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that a lot of these documents and best
management practices are connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the amount of nutrients and
sediment that's getting into the water and
[SPEAKER_00]: causing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the guests this week we were
trying to get was Mike Goatley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read one of his papers he was
involved in, which talks about the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of turf grass nutrient management as it
pertains to the Chesapeake Bay watershed
[SPEAKER_00]: and how the regulatory environment has
shaped sort of how we use turf grass
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers in this watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes back to water quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the picture that people can see on the
screen from this watershed, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really big stretches across six states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of red on that image.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red means there's not a lot of oxygen in
the water and that's because these
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are basically powering organisms
that are sucking up all the oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing left for the plants and
animal life that are needed to thrive in
[SPEAKER_00]: those situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that nutrients are a concern
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we fix this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of standard approach from an
environmental engineering perspective is
[SPEAKER_00]: develop a TMDL.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks may have heard this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stands for total maximum daily load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's essentially a process that you go
through to clean up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, okay, you identify a problem and
then you got to figure out, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many pollutants are getting into this
water body?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we quantify the amount of nitrogen
or phosphorus or sediment that's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do a lot of assuming and we
need to run this through a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: models, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of land in this watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of equations that go into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they try and make their best estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they got to figure out, okay,
how much do we have to reduce that
[SPEAKER_00]: pollutant load so that we get clean water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they develop those targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the TMDL sort of targets,
actual numbers we have to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to figure out ways to hit
those best management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where these sort of plans come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you do that and eventually the
water gets cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the numbers for Chesapeake Bay
watershed are this.
[SPEAKER_00]: 84.3 million kilograms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want any more than that per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.7 million kilograms of phosphorus and
2.9 billion kilograms of sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to exceed those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to hit those targets by
2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are like really big numbers,
again, sort of abstract, like where do we
[SPEAKER_00]: get those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes back to this modeling
component where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: assumptions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got ag contributing, we've got turf
grass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're gonna talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's natural sort of secretion of
nutrients that just sort of get out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the assumptions we learned a
couple of years ago in a call,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, with some folks in the New York
State DEC was that they assume every piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of turf grass in this watershed is
fertilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were sort of like, oh boy,
that's a red flag, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not a good assumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was too late for us to sort of
change that assumption in the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we did sort of look up some numbers
and you know, how much do homeowners
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a good proxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like 40 to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not great data on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably is regional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably breaking down by rural,
suburban, urban.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably different amounts of
fertilizer going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is that assumption of
100% is wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a famous quote from a British
statistician, George Box, and it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: all models are wrong, but some are useful,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us in turf grass, we get really
defensive and part of those assumptions
[SPEAKER_00]: being 100% of turf is fertilized lead to,
hey, we gotta do a lot of these best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices to reduce our fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times there's a regulatory
aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have phosphorus laws across all these
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nitrogen sort of caps in some
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what it's accomplished is
probably still pretty useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the accomplishment is
codifying these best management practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an expert turf panel in the
Chesapeake Bay and they come up with these
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 core practices that if we do these
things, we can estimate that we reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen leaking out of turf systems,
phosphorus leaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one is how we came into
developing this urban nutrient management
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says basically, develop an urban
nutrient management plan for the property
[SPEAKER_00]: based on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we talked about MLSN last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about, you know, we should
probably use less fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that plan codifying that helps
reduce the excess fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now two of the other ones I think are
really important have nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, but they sort of have
everything to do with what turf does in
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of our landscapes and how it pertains
to water quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is maintaining dense
vegetation cover of turf grass that
[SPEAKER_00]: reduces erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces runoff and retains nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is saying, you know, there's a
reason we have a lot of grass and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because it slows the water down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let's slow that water down,
reduce erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turf grass is good at using
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let all the nutrients that are in
that water seep into the grass and the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass can use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes it out of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that they mentioned,
one of the BMPs is make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in turf grass systems has good
porosity and infiltration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a reason if you have
compacted areas, especially waters sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: on a steep slope, it's going really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want that water to go in and not
across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that reduces our pollutant
loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Chesapeake Bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we have grass and why we have
a lot of grass is because it functions in
[SPEAKER_00]: these environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the BMPs is like, make sure you
have all grass and not bare area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing from a turf
management perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Carl, listen, and let's go through a
couple of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because each one of these things has its
own story to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start out with soil testing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually been, as you mentioned last
week, not necessarily supportive of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's interpreted in a way we think is
not consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we even made the Asian turf grass
programs, a shout out this week from Micah
[SPEAKER_01]: Woods, commenting on our conversation from
last week that you led, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't that your soil testing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way you're interpreting the
numbers that you're getting and the way
[SPEAKER_01]: you're calibrating those soil nutrients to
your observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing I want to say is I
remember driving by the golf course with
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of this environmental engineer
was visiting us one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just driving like we always do out
from the campus, which is very urban,
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the turf plots and where the golf
course is, which is very suburban,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the edge of suburban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing the engineer says,
man, it's so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a sponge for all this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually says, I don't know why anybody
gives golf courses a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like perfect for the storm water
management needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of it is, Carl, we don't always
look at things the way other people look
[SPEAKER_01]: at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you just demonstrated in
your point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The engineers, well, it's grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be fertilized in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we do know back to this point,
when you got a lot of organic matter and
[SPEAKER_01]: you got active soil life, you are
releasing nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But theoretically one would hope that
wouldn't exceed what a plant and a system
[SPEAKER_01]: could take up in a rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are times when just organic
matter levels build up and can leak and
[SPEAKER_01]: there could be just natural releases of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the last point here, I actually got a
picture to talk about things we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think about where I'm going to talk about
sports fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit today, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intersection of these ecosystem
services and the functional use of this
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape is very dramatic on these sports
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just ask you again to remind me,
you read a paper or talk to us about a
[SPEAKER_01]: paper that showed compacted sports fields
are getting on the radar of storm water
[SPEAKER_01]: management engineers to your Chesapeake
Bay point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this isn't a chemical property,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about soil physical
properties, which is what your last core
[SPEAKER_01]: management thing was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about what we
mean when we say compacted surface?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously there's no grass here,
so that's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the compacted soils on these
fields create runoff problems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we talked a little bit about the
modeling that goes into figuring out,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what pollutant loads getting into
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a thesis at a temple and they do
a lot of monitoring of, okay, when we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a rain event, how much water comes off of
this land and this watershed and how fast
[SPEAKER_00]: does it come off?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do some calculations based on
the land use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a sports field that's sort
of a natural lawn turf grass environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's different from a developed housing
area that has a lot of impermeable
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different from a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have some estimates on how much
water should come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do those estimates and then
they're collecting data on how much water
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hmm, there's more water
coming off than we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coming off faster than we
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What assumptions are we getting wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're sort of pointing to is
like, no, there's all these athletic
[SPEAKER_00]: fields and we're assuming an infiltration
rate of X and it's coming off faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they're figuring out is that
if these athletic fields are compacted,
[SPEAKER_00]: that water is not going in like it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's overloading.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more water than they're expecting
coming off of this watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that affects how they design green
infrastructure or water control structures
[SPEAKER_00]: at the outlet point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were sort of pointing to like,
hmm, like that's maybe something we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to consider either changing in our model
or it would be great if we manage these
[SPEAKER_00]: sports fields to have a certain amount of
infiltration and collect that water like
[SPEAKER_00]: we think it should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since we're talking about the soil,
let's start with soil temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was surprisingly warm in the New
York metropolitan area, well into the
[SPEAKER_01]: sixties, almost everywhere, except the
highest elevations are pushing into the
[SPEAKER_01]: upper fifties.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got temperatures well into the
seventies in the metropolitan New York
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a pretty big deal because
you're now in the throes of active growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: active soil life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure you've got your
summer patch sprays down, your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen sprays, because obviously the
infection period for these organisms is
[SPEAKER_01]: well underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been warmer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The early part of last week, before it got
cool, most recently was in the forties
[SPEAKER_01]: today here in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you warm overall last week,
a little more well above normal last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting thing is, and this is,
I think, and also a very interesting point
[SPEAKER_01]: of discussion, Carl, because this was like
the second week where I've observed some
[SPEAKER_01]: drying in my eye tests of traveling around
the area, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at precipitation minus
evapotranspiration, you see, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of localized nature of
precipitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, when we're talking about
runoff, we got pockets of three and four
[SPEAKER_01]: inches of rain being dumped in some of
these areas in Scranton, along the Cape,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the north end, north shore of Long
Island, into the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not 10 miles, 20 miles away,
you're at an inch or two inch deficit,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it looks like the drying is going
to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, looking at the lawn water model,
Carl, the model is picking up the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It picked up the rain that went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for Long Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the Farmingdale location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sandy areas now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still have plenty of water, don't need to
irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely, I think, honing in on
the drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth estimates are also showing that
growth is pretty active, particularly when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not irrigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some of these locations,
you better check these things because
[SPEAKER_01]: these localized models are going to
indicate whether growth is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: higher or below normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is where it gets funny to me,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The foliar models have been very active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much earlier, I think even Art mentioned
this morning, the brown patch model was
[SPEAKER_01]: flaring up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soils are drying, but the foliage is wet,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at sort of where we are
today, and where we're going to be by the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you spray, Carl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would you, if you're at the end of a
spray, would you spray or would you hold?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got dry soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you've got to maybe add some
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me a little bit about management
decisions with your water model,
[SPEAKER_01]: your growth model, and your disease models
all integrated together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're all useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the one thing with the
dollar spot models, and we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: this a bit last week, is it spiked up and
it should be coming down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to run the prediction on
that to like June 2nd or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more of the region is going to be
in green.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have these cool nights,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that perspective, I think I would
hold off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the perspective of like,
you know, I'm a course that has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, let's say five, I've accounted
for five fungicide sprays on my fairways
[SPEAKER_00]: for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably had to go out two weeks ago
when it sort of spiked up there and it got
[SPEAKER_00]: really hot and humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got four left and I've got June,
July, August, and we know the fall
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure has been getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been saving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been saving these applications in
the spring because the whole thing shifted
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, so I would save.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice part is that that growth
potential is going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting into sort of ideal
temperatures if you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have soil moisture and it's not
limiting growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I got a little bit, I would expect
the turf to grow out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm thinking large areas,
fairways, and I've got limited sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely holding off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm even looking at the Smith-Kerns
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very low the next couple of days
because it doesn't look at the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: wetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we rely on leaf wetness, which
considers, had that it rain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a lot of relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smith-Kerns is only relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I look at both of those models and I
sort of sort of centralized the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations, I'd say, yeah,
I would definitely hold off on fairways if
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a limited amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now listen, my phone's been ringing off
the hook about natural and synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that keeps coming up
is there's not transparency between the
[SPEAKER_01]: governance and stewardship of sports
fields, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we're going to be talking
about this a lot over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got a grant to do some work in
this area in school grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to use the example of some of
the things we've learned here at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: as a way of helping people in the grounds
area, the sports turf area especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe golf guys will have something to
learn here as well as how to
[SPEAKER_01]: operationalize or add some data to their
technical operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a story that started with me
serving on a governance board for our
[SPEAKER_01]: athletic department.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just finished up my 17th year as the
chair of the faculty advisory committee,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I am now retired from this committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a long and storied journey
that included the renovation of the swim
[SPEAKER_01]: test here at Cornell, which fell under the
auspices of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I was responsible for
doing every few years was to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation to the faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things the faculty Senate
was very interested in, listen,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Cornell faculty Senate is the largest
collection of nerds in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere between a nerd fest and the
Roman Senate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to hear ourselves pontificate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every once in a while, they invite a
knucklehead like me to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always get a lot of questions about
concussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I come prepared to discuss our
concussion management program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at a university.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brain is the most active muscle in
your body by far at this place than any
[SPEAKER_01]: other muscle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our athletes have to be very mindful
of concussions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that the NCAA has
been all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, this is something that sports
in general has to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a collection of data that over
the years I've been presenting,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the various sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from 2013 through 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see football in general is very
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men's ice hockey in some years could have
as much as football.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women's ice hockey still gets a fair
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lacrosse, another sport we're fairly good
at, can be above average many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even wrestling, another sport we're
pretty darn good at, trying to get all
[SPEAKER_01]: those well-fed Western Pennsylvania boys
here rassling around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, this is a significant
concern for governance, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about governance versus
stewardship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the governance includes
playing the game different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe you're not going to have
kickoffs in high school anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these things that happen at the
high levels maybe impact us at a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can tell you the game has changed
for us here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we hired the assistant coach for the
national champion Stanford soccer team a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of years ago, Coach Smith here,
he gets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets hired.
[SPEAKER_01]: He walks out on the natural grass field
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, we can't play soccer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't kick a ball in a straight line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to investments of a fair
amount of money to get the fields up to
[SPEAKER_01]: shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it did also is it thrust myself
and Carl, and at the time, my graduate
[SPEAKER_01]: student, Chris Sitko, who's now the
director of this whole operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: thrust us into having to manage this,
work with the coaches, work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were managing these fields,
work with the players, work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all a bunch of disparate
groups that there was no centralized focus
[SPEAKER_01]: for the way this field was tended to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the first thing that jumped out at
me, and Carl, you probably heard me say
[SPEAKER_01]: this, is there's two kinds of coaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're thinking about just governance
from a coach's perspective, you've got two
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of coaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a coach who can say,
I want the ball to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear a good picture of an
athlete deflecting the ball to the side
[SPEAKER_01]: and then maybe advancing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's that little bit of
friction that occurs there that some
[SPEAKER_01]: coaches will say, really, I want it to
behave this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got these coaches,
oh, you need to mow lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to roll more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you core this field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay in your lane, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the grounds people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to realize, whoa, now I know why I'm
an academic and why I have so much respect
[SPEAKER_01]: for guys like Ben Palmer and Nicole
Sherry, Dan Cunningham, all these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that are managing fields on a regular
basis dealing with coaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we became, as you might expect it,
Carl, you know, very data driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the coach is going to tell us what he
wants, we're going to have to use numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: in one way, shape or form to know how to
make adjustments in our maintenance
[SPEAKER_01]: program that then results in measurable
differences in these devices, be they for
[SPEAKER_01]: hardness, moisture, traction, ball roll,
ball bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two setups for our soccer
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Berman field was built in 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful, sandy, engineered soccer
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has sand with compost and soil in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about two acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was re-sotted to Kentucky Bluegrass in
2016 and is now being renovated into a
[SPEAKER_01]: ryegrass surface because the other
operation that the students practice on is
[SPEAKER_01]: an off campus location where they've got
two practice fields, both for men and for
[SPEAKER_01]: women, and some training ground in between
that are primarily ryegrass annual
[SPEAKER_01]: bluegrass surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the testaments, one of the
things that we've been able to do is to
[SPEAKER_01]: use this data to make these two different
playing surfaces play the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the annual bluegrass problem has
become so severe on the Berman field that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've not been able to combat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be shifting more of it
over to ryegrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I want to say about
this in general is I believe cool season
[SPEAKER_01]: natural grass fields are done best when
there's a bluegrass base that provides you
[SPEAKER_01]: that stability for a cleat to dig in and
then whatever the hell you want to grow on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to intensely seed ryegrass,
if you want to put more tall fescue on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry a little bit more with tall fescue
that it can get bunch type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you heard from Cal Bigelow a couple
of weeks ago, we can actually do tall
[SPEAKER_01]: fescue pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when we started this operation with
them, it wasn't looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were having all kinds of problems with
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to raise the sprinkler heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a lot of infrastructural things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I'm going to tell
anybody, if they're talking to me about
[SPEAKER_01]: natural versus synthetic, is do you know
what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an infrastructure that can
actually support the goals that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to achieve?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we did, and Carl, I believe
you and Chris led this effort years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: is we basically said, OK, the people we're
talking to only understand numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand anything about
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably weren't that interested in
engineering, but they might be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very much interested in the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys did a great job saying,
OK, how much do we do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: For this, for that, the other thing,
we started to look at the various fields
[SPEAKER_01]: and the amount of time we were spending on
them with floating time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we learned the concept
of wrench time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time people spend actually doing
the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give them reports on, hey,
here's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a school district,
if you're at a municipality, just track
[SPEAKER_01]: your hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it take you to do these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then start beginning to communicate
these things in a way that say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's what this takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the overseeding that we had to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the week-long practices where we
dominated by mowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we did another 13-week period where
we did more top dressing out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just putting in the hours over a
13-week period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to talk to them and give them
reports about the data that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: finding and the things that mattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to get them to use covers in
the high-traffic areas where they'd see
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had been able to create an
environment over the last, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially seven years till then we hired
Chris Sitko back to run the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: operation, where we had to methodically
work through the government and the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's governance and different
parties involved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even when you do that,
Carl, the senior day comes along and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're calling me on a Saturday and it's
like, Frank, they got senior day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling me that they don't know
what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a real plan in place,
right, for what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a person really that
oversaw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were calling us and we said,
I don't know, get out there and test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tested it and said, don't play on that
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The darn thing is frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you take the snow off,
they took the snow off and played anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when you give them the data,
sometimes they're going to do what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where I'd wrap this up,
Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think any operation that manages sports
fields, golf courses, or grounds should
[SPEAKER_01]: have established protocols for the way
they go about their business, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be centered in just what a
superintendent knows or a foreman knows or
[SPEAKER_01]: the people who worked there for 15 years
knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be things written down to
say, this is how we operate this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to use that as a way of
communicating our needs externally,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep following up with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hire good people and you treat them
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much what it comes
down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk to people about natural
versus synthetic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that there are competing
priorities, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are competing priorities for use,
how safe it is, the environmental costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the money, and the sociology, which is
there are egos associated with getting
[SPEAKER_01]: certain kinds of surfaces in communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the way you fund these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a capital expense or is it an
ongoing expense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A capital expense, like a synthetic field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about maintaining
it, so to speak, and versus a natural
[SPEAKER_01]: grass field, which is going to have
ongoing expenses, which includes
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance differences that you can learn
more about at our sports field website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the QR code for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go to our Safe Sports Field
website and get some information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be renovated as part of our
granting program and also the best
[SPEAKER_01]: management practices that are available
from a variety of states.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the New England guys did a really
wonderful job with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, Carl, that seems to be it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just be me and you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions that came up or
comments you want to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have any questions,
but I think the comment, Frank,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, when you're trying to affect change of
that governance structure and tell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, we need X amount of people for X
number of labor hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember we talked about mowers and
replacing mower blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took you, right, professor in the
College of Ag and Life Sciences,
[SPEAKER_00]: it took a graduate student at the time,
Chris, and then me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three people, I didn't know,
I'm not sure I entirely knew what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, but two people who knew what they
were doing and me who was trying to put
[SPEAKER_00]: all the Excel stuff together to really
communicate those needs over several years
[SPEAKER_00]: to start to see that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally now, Chris taking over
and having that sort of baseline and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to continuously communicate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to have an undergrad
student who's going to go out and take
[SPEAKER_00]: this playability a couple of times a week
to, again, sort of figure out when Coach
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith says, hey, I don't like how the
divoting it is, or I don't like how the
[SPEAKER_00]: ball's reacting, we can have numbers that
say, oh, that's when we see the shear
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look like this or the firmness test look
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough for one person to affect all
that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, I've said, you got to hire
somebody and they need to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing, but that person also needs
support in communicating those numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just not as simple as a K through
12 district hiring a person who knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to empower them to have other
people and train other people around them
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to communicate and work with
the governance structure to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, we can't meet your expectations
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need other people to support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we're going to ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to review, Carl, in 30 minutes,
we did urban nutrient management and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: management, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we did dollar spot and digital tool
modeling and how to use those models to
[SPEAKER_01]: make decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we talked about managing sports
fields in an operational way to get sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of be able to sort of know what you're
doing and then communicate it to other
[SPEAKER_01]: people around the various surfaces that we
manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine you're going to get more
in 30 minutes anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one quick question Vitas was asking
about the data from shear and compaction
[SPEAKER_00]: tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of a good way to get a
holistic sort of look at the performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think firmness is sort of number
one I would go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that traction component is the
next one I'd go to any comments from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank on additional tools or if those are
sort of what you would start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the ones we use there are pretty
good, but I think you have to realize
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all indirect measurements of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not direct measurements of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it is important to calibrate
them, whatever device you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I think we use them is there's
already a data set that a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: sporting organizations have provided
feedback on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know FIFA is really elucidated these
things to no end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there really isn't any end to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I say those are two good places to
start because, number one, you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: these kids cracking their heads open when
they hit their head on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they crack their heads open,
banging into each other, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not something that you definitely
want them doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And traction is something it's good to
know if the turf is going to slip out from
[SPEAKER_01]: them, which is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that the turf is too stiff for
them, which is also bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that sweet spot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say those are the two best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I added anything, I would probably add
the ball, the ball roll and the ball
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce, because that also tends to be
something that the players and coaches can
[SPEAKER_01]: really associate their performance with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll wrap it up for us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of ground covered today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of ground, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ground covered turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered the pitch, as the Europeans
would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fully covered the pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Covered the pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you all for those attending live.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will see us next week with Ben
McGraw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
