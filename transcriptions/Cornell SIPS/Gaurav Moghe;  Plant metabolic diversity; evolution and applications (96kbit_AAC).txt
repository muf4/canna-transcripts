[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Susan, for inviting me to speak
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually a pleasure to talk to a
different audience about the research
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the work that I'm going to talk
about here today is all based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that we got over the last one and
a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the first time I'm presenting
where none of the slides are about my post
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice to get your feedback on
some of the questions that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: approaching in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this presentation is divided into three
sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll first give a short introduction about
metabolites and plant breeding and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do is relevant to the mission of plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then focus on two major topics that we are
looking at in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do novel metabolic classes emerge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do enzymes and enzyme families
gain new functions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I'll end with summary and
acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of images, pictures in
this presentation, and most of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: obtained from Wikimedia Commons under a
share alike license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm good to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we know that plant metabolites are
used for many purposes, from food,
[SPEAKER_00]: which most of you study here, to spices,
dyes, medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the artemisinin tablets,
which is the first line of defense against
[SPEAKER_00]: malaria, parasite, pyrethrin, which many
of us will use in the spring and summer to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of all the insects in our lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Valentine's Day is coming in two
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metabolites are also important for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important in agriculture because
going back to the beginning of human
[SPEAKER_00]: civilization, we moved from a
hunter-gatherer lifestyle to cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: wild grains, pulses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then many crops were domesticated all
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were important for primary
nutrition, for macro and macro nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as we started domesticating crops
and using different species for our
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, we also focused on,
humans also focused on foods that can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence the senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those examples are blueberries,
for example, or this cacao pod,
[SPEAKER_00]: which an acetic sculpture is depicting
cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while researching on how humans have
started domesticating crops, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some interesting stories that I came
across, which I thought would be relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: to this topic and would be also
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we know that as crops,
as humans started traveling and connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: with different cultures, there were trade
routes established.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a famous silk route from China
to Europe, and then spices came through
[SPEAKER_00]: the sea route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arabian traders over here had quite a bit
of monopoly over transport of spices to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the stories that you come
across are really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, black pepper came from the
southern coast of India, Malabar coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Europeans believed, because
Arabian traders told them, the black
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper is expensive because the trees have
to be burned, because the trees are
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by snakes, and you have to get
rid of the snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're expensive, and that's
why the peppercorns have wrinkled
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance, the trees have to be burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of stories about snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this one story about how to
get cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Arabian traders told the Europeans
that cinnamon actually grows on trees that
[SPEAKER_00]: are high up in the mountains, and you
can't reach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this bird, it makes its nest out of
cinnamon twigs, and you need to throw lead
[SPEAKER_00]: balls at the nests of those birds to get
the cinnamon sticks down, and it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cinnamon is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why then, because of all these
monopolies, so Arabians had monopoly over
[SPEAKER_00]: transport of spices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rome had monopoly over the sea route from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Portuguese Spanish, British,
they started exploring other areas for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the spices, and that led to the
age of discovery, where Spanish,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, conquered huge parts and
established colonies in South America and
[SPEAKER_03]: North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these metabolites have literally
changed human history.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we all know about El Dorado,
the land of gold, which is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a mythical city in Brazil, where Spanish
explorers went and started looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: land of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But along the second mission for their
discoveries was La Canela, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: land of cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought that, in fact,
Amazon was called the Rio de Canela before
[SPEAKER_00]: the river of cinnamon, because they
thought that cinnamon trees grew somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all because the Europeans
loved the smell of cinnamon in coffee or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first exploration of the Amazon
River, the first starting of the Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: River happened because a party went down
into the Amazon looking for the cinnamon
[SPEAKER_00]: trees, which they never found,
because people who had first found that
[SPEAKER_00]: misidentified the species and some people
had lied just to get money for these
[SPEAKER_00]: explorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it resulted in new discoveries along
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much of this plant diversity that we
see, cinnamon or black pepper,
[SPEAKER_00]: piperine, is all lineage-specific
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur only in specific lineages in
the plant family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are also economically very
important, aesthetically very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are important for human civilization
as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that only a small
proportion of plants have actually been
[SPEAKER_00]: sampled for the chemical constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are an estimated 400,000 flowering
plant species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of that, it's estimated, according to
this paper, that only about 60,000 have
[SPEAKER_00]: been sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only a even smaller proportion of them
have been studied for their active
[SPEAKER_00]: principles, because most of these are
mixtures used in folk medicines and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many plants produce compounds of high
societal and economic importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their active principles are not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biogenetic pathways are not known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ways of harvesting are not optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just grow a lot of trees,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, everybody in this audience
will know northern Borlaug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a famous Borlaug hypothesis,
which just says that increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: productivity of agriculture on the best
farmland can help control deforestation by
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing the demand for new farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This depends on two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is productivity of agriculture for
spices, for these lineage-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, or high economic values of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to breed for these,
because these are trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's difficult to grow these
farmlands, because again, some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: are trees or not easily, crops that don't
easily grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one approach that has been used is
heterologous expression of the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_00]: these biogenetic pathways in different
non-modal organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might hear from Joyce about some
of these approaches in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can express pathways in different
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tobacco and Nicotiana has been used
very frequently to express compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Camelina, sativa, populous, different
plants have been used, but also yeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are used for making many of these
high-value compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One example of, a recent example of that,
2017 paper from Anos Burns Group in UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: was a synthesis of triterpenoid so what
they did was, so this pathway is more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less charted, going all the way to
beta-amarine triterpenoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this case, they expressed the side
one enzyme with individual enzymes in
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, and they were able to get,
this was just based, this was not based on
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation, this was just transient
expression of these enzymes in Nicotiana,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is much easier, actually,
using agrobacterium transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to get significant
quantities of beta-amarine, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: possible normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to grow a lot of plants for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using that as the primary
scaffold, they expressed cytochrome P450s
[SPEAKER_00]: from various different species,
medicago, poplar, ischometrella,
[SPEAKER_00]: and were able to get quite a bit of
variation in the final products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these are really economically
valuable, some of these are not even found
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using this approach can help produce
those compounds on a large scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be used for medicine,
for various agricultural purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: like biopesticides, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a couple of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: First is, first challenge, given that
there are, the first challenge is there
[SPEAKER_00]: are only a small proportion of plants that
have been sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge is that, although there
are over a million estimated plant
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, only 50,000, a maximum of
50,000 have been documented in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-specific databases, and the compound
with spectral information, mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometric information, which we can
use to identify matching compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like NCBI GenBank, used for identifying if
your sequence has already been found
[SPEAKER_00]: before, we use spectral databases to
identify compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 to 15,000 compounds actually have
the spectral information, LC-MS spectral
[SPEAKER_00]: information, so it's a very low
proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: To identify these compounds using mass
spectrometry, mass spectrometry only gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you the peaks, then you have to isolate
those compounds and study them using
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear magnetic resonance, which is
difficult because first of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: instruments are used, you need expert
knowledge to identify these compounds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you need to purify milligram to
gram level compounds of many plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is unfeasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second challenge is when you are
trying to produce these compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: heterologous systems, you need to know
their pathways, you need to know how they
[SPEAKER_00]: are produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for many plants, many metabolites,
we don't know the pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now easy to sequence any genome,
so this graph shows x-axis is years and
[SPEAKER_00]: y-axis is number of genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ignore the colors for now, and what you
can see is that it's very easy to sequence
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes for this thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's then easy to predict genes quickly
using programs like Maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a standardized pipeline, you deploy
it and you get all the genes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using programs like Blast2Go, you can
annotate their functions computationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this program then uses similarity
searches against annotated genomes to
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the annotation of your genome of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, when you trace back where
that original annotation came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of it would come from Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a non-moderate species
somewhere deep in the plant, somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: distant from Arabidopsis, the predictions
for highly conserved genes are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: good, but for genes in gene families or
enzymes in enzyme families where there are
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent duplications and functional
diversions, that prediction is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in Arabidopsis thaliana, only about
30% of the genes may actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: experimentally annotated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are predicted based on
similarity to worm or human space or
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of certain domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the genes in the current annotation
don't even have a proper geoannotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just biological process or molecular
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, this is the point that I
just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This becomes a major issue for duplicated
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these processes, tandem or whole-gen
duplication, occur very frequently in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we run into a problem of this
annotation of many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this problem exists because it's easy
to sequence any genome now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our lab, we are using different
approaches to tackle these main questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, first of all, using a machine
learning, developing machine learning
[SPEAKER_00]: pipelines to predict metabolite classes
from mass spec data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project is looking at enzymes and
enzyme families, which are currently the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest black box in annotation,
and trying to see if we can predict enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final goal is to predict enzyme
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking at some non-model species
with the goal of identifying biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, finally, we are using
co-expression networks It's a project that
[SPEAKER_00]: we just started a couple of months ago
using co-expression networks to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic enzyme, metabolic pathways,
and their transcriptional regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on two projects in this
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first project is looking at modern
glory convalescent species.
[SPEAKER_00]: This family produces a class of compounds
called resin glycosides, which comprise of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sugar core, shown in black.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are produced from the roots and
leaves of the plant, of the modern glory
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are known to be active against
bacteria and a whole host of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ipomea purga, which is considered
a medicinal plant in India and in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots of this plant accumulate 20% of
their dry weight as resin glycosides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they are used as purgatives in Mexican
and Indian traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet potato lines that produce a lot of
resin glycosides were shown to be less
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by nematode rot in field
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, we are developing projects right
now to see if they impact sweet potato
[SPEAKER_00]: weevil or wireworm resistance in sweet
potatoes grown in South Carolina and North
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main questions of this project are,
are there any patterns to resin glycoside
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity across the convalescent family?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these compounds produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this pathway present only in the
convalescent because solanaceae does not,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sister family does not produce this
class of compounds, and how can they be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in agriculture and medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project is led by Ali Bennett,
who is a horticulture master's graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: from here, but now she's a research
professor in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we looked at several
different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grounded, grew those plants,
grounded leaves and roots, used an
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction protocol, and then ran it on
LCMS using the exactive orbitrap at Boyce
[SPEAKER_00]: Thompson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is the kind of profiles
we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are resin glycoside peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in these three species,
you can see, so x axis is the retention
[SPEAKER_00]: time when they come out into the mass spec
from the liquid chromatography column,
[SPEAKER_00]: and y axis is the abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that in these three species
itself, they are quite variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we identify resin glycosides?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for each of these peaks, you can look
at the fragment condition patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this is the positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can see it fragment in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using that, we can identify what sort
of side chains will be present and whether
[SPEAKER_00]: this is really a resin glycoside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is previous literature about what
kind of long side chains could be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use that as a marker for identifying
resin glycosides in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we looked at about 28 or 30 species
across the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the x axis shows the bi-z,
which is the mass of the detected resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoside, and color indicates the peak
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that it is quite,
the profiles are quite variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So convalulose equitans produces a lot of
resin glycosides, which are totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different from the ones that hypomia
species produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at that in the phylogenetic
context, we begin to see some patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, first of all, we see that this
hydroxy palmitic acid, C16 hydroxy fatty
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, is present as a side chain in all of
the resin glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other side chains that are
also long fatty acids that are also
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see that in some species,
Dichondra and hypomia purpurea,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a huge number of resin
glycosides in the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are very few present in the
shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, in other species,
convalulose and operculina, we see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of them in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very few in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the hypothesis we had was,
questions we had was when, where are they
[SPEAKER_00]: produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this suggests that they could be
produced both in the root and the shoot,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are testing by other methods now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently we are addressing how are the
resin glycosides produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the bonds that exist in the
structure, we can hypothesize the presence
[SPEAKER_00]: of certain enzymatic activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we submitted samples for RNA-seq and
just last, even yesterday evening,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got our proteomics results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had suspected that this particular
band right here from the protein extract
[SPEAKER_00]: we did was the BHDSL transferase that's
involved in carrying out this activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did find one of, one BHDSL transfer
in the proteomics data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing it and analyzing it
further to see if it is involved in resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glycoside production.
[SPEAKER_00]: One issue with using, with working with
enzyme family members is even if you see
[SPEAKER_00]: in vitro activity with the enzyme that you
have cloned, it may not, because these
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes have promiscuous activities,
it may not translate to an activity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, we use virus-induced gene
silencing to transiently silence the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of the gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, this is the positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is phytoin desaturase,
which is involved in carotenoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you knock it down, the leaf,
it'll get a photobleaching effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in phalpic losses,
which is a sorenessia species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows that the positive control
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you've been seeing again and again
in, in ipomia and carnivorous,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we tried to silence, is that it's only
a partial silencing, which stays on for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the new leaves that emerge after
a few days, they don't show this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are standardizing this approach even
more using different growing conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and filtration methods to get a better
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we do that with positive control,
then we will do that with the candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another project that we are doing at
Margaret Frank's lab is grafting the shoot
[SPEAKER_00]: and root of different plants, different
species together onto each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that if the resin
glycosides are produced in the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you graft on, if you graft a
different shoot onto it, you might see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they are transported or whether
they are just produced in the individual's
[SPEAKER_00]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done the grafting between solenum
lycoplasicum, which does not produce resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides, phenovilous and ipomia,
which produce different types of resin
[SPEAKER_00]: glycosides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just the un-grafted plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the grafted plants are dying right
now with only a few surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also in the process where we are
standardizing the process of hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll have better survival next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the self-grafts that survive,
but the non-self-grafts are all dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this project, the next steps are to
identify and validate the candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the evolutionary history of the
enzymes, and study the resistance to sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: potato pest resistance, relevance to pest
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: These resin glycosides have also been
shown to be Timo sensitizers in Timo
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of the circular chain,
that circular ring that they form,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can make pores inside cell membranes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving them, along with Timo therapy
agents, it seems like you need to use less
[SPEAKER_00]: of those of the Timo therapy agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reduces the toxicity of those agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are purifying those resin glycosides
right now, and we'll test it out by
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborating with someone in biomedical
engineering to study if we can reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: dose of Timo therapy agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next project is, the long-term aim of
that project is to predict enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main motivation for that is that
there are many enzyme families which play
[SPEAKER_00]: an important role in plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cytochrome P450, for example, in many
plant genomes, it takes up 1% of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted genes, which is quite a huge
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is hypothesized that because of
these enzyme families, new metabolic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways emerge in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say a metabolite A1 emerges due
to a promiscuous activity of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This A1 could be converted to A2 by a
promiscuous activity of some other enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it leads to a production of a new
metabolic pathway if some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites are important for fitness of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I showed before, these are all
cytochrome P450s are members of enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: families.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create new novel decorations on
existing templates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each of, even difference in
stereochemistry or which position is
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated or oxidized can lead to drastic
differences in the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand how these
functions evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now functional discovery in enzyme
families is difficult because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: functional redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always easy or possible to do
gene knockouts because other enzymes might
[SPEAKER_00]: have similar activities and you might need
to do quadruple knockouts to actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: a knockout phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evolve new functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rapidly after gene duplication,
which happens at a higher rate in enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: families because the mutational space is
large and then they show
[SPEAKER_00]: multifunctionality and promiscuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we reasoned was if we are to
predict enzyme activities, the first step
[SPEAKER_00]: is to understand how enzyme family members
evolve after gene duplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do their functions diverge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a rule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there some common rules that we can
identify by which these enzyme family
[SPEAKER_00]: activities evolve?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, we are focusing on an enzyme
family called a BARD or BAD, as in
[SPEAKER_00]: transferase enzyme family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each letter in the family stands for a
particular enzyme that was found in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in tomato, there are a hundred members
of that enzyme family, all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in different functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic activity that they do is
transfer an acyl group from an coenzyme A
[SPEAKER_00]: donor to a hydroxyl or an amine group on
an acceptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get benzyl acetate, which is
emitted from floral tissues and it gives a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice smell to the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group that is transferred can
range from C2, so acetyl group,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to C12, C14.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the highest limit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These enzyme family members are involved
in a variety of metabolic pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are involved in acyl sugars,
which I used to study for my postdoc,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, alkaloids,
flavonoids, anthocyanins, short-chain
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohols.
[SPEAKER_00]: They catalyze this transfer of the acyl
group onto various acceptor molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the major questions for this project
are, how did the enzyme family originate
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place?
[SPEAKER_00]: How has it diversified since its origin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is it, what is that a pattern to
how, why they use such a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we convert one bar function to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be very useful when we are,
when we are for genetic engineering later
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line, if we can identify rules by
which we can change one activity to
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then based on these rules,
can we predict the bar enzyme activity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this project is led by Lars,
who is a postdoc in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing that we did was we took the
bar acyltransferase domain, the hidden
[SPEAKER_00]: marker model of the domain, and performed
a search against several sequenced plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species across the family, across the
plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that there are several dozens
to hundreds of members across different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just number of barbed members
and this is normalized to the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: predicted genes in that genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that the major expansion
started in algae, the number is very
[SPEAKER_00]: small, but the major expansion of this
family started later.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Lars did was he collected about 160
enzymes across all plants for whom
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical activities had already been
characterized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these are characterized enzymes
and these are the different classes of
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that there is a huge
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using this information and the
orthologous, and this, the patterns that
[SPEAKER_00]: we identified here on the species tree,
we were able to predict how the functions
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved in a stepwise fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, these enzymes,
enzymes involved in phenolic ester
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis, barred enzymes, they have
orthologs across all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most likely explanation is that this
was the ancestral activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, the waxes, waxes
enzymes are mostly found from mercantile
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that activity, barred enzymes may have
gotten recruited into wax biosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: later in embryo fights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly new activities started
getting added.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see them being recruited into novel
metabolic classes even more recently in
[SPEAKER_00]: just Solanaceae or just Fabaceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Fabaceae, they are recruited into
isoflavonoid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's happening on a continual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so all subsequent barred enzymes
likely emerged from barred enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in phenolic ester biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenolic esters are involved in lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this actually makes a little bit of
sense because as the plant started moving
[SPEAKER_00]: on to dry land, you get innovations of
entire biosynthetic machinery for waxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so around the same time, barred
enzymes also started getting recruited in
[SPEAKER_00]: this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the question about how they can
accept such diverse acceptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: our rationale was that when you have a
barred enzyme, the moment after its
[SPEAKER_00]: duplication, it's using exactly the same
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time, the substrates start
diverging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hypothesize that when it starts
accepting new substrates, it doesn't go
[SPEAKER_00]: too far away from its ancestral substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new substrate is going to be
structurally similar to the old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to get some measure of how
similar the substrates are between
[SPEAKER_00]: duplicated barred enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we used a method called MCS
overlap or maximum common substructure
[SPEAKER_00]: overlap coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The method is basically a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of using gene sequences,
nucleotide sequences, we are using
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at pairs of atoms and
stereochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there is stereochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if there's stereochemistry
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they look at different features,
and they try to predict how similar the
[SPEAKER_00]: two structures are to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lars calculated all versus all pairwise
similarities for all the 131 barred
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates and built a network using
cytoscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I show you the network,
I wanted to show you a pattern that you
[SPEAKER_00]: see for barred enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the x-axis is ks, or synonymous
substitution rates, which shows 0 is a
[SPEAKER_00]: recently duplicated enzyme pair,
and this is the most old duplicated pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And y-axis is the similarity between
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the recently duplicated pairs use very
similar substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the time since duplication is
increasing, they start utilizing more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more different substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The r squared for this is only about 0.25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not explaining full all of the
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only part of the variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an expected pattern, so nothing
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second, when he built a network,
then we started seeing some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, different nodes refer to
different substrates of the barred
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are acyl sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we expected, as we had hoped,
all of them are clustering based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: structural similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acyl sugars are clustering together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins are here, flavonoids are
here, long-chain alcohols, polyamines,
[SPEAKER_00]: taxol biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this consists of various
different substrates, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: structurally similar, but they fall in a
common space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this space we refer to as ancestral
space, because the HCP enzyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is involved in phenolic ester
biosynthesis, all of its substrates are
[SPEAKER_00]: lying in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diamond-shaped substrates are all
substrates of the HCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the HQT enzymes, which are the
ancestral enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we see that the space occupied by
these substrates is quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if an enzyme can use this substrate
and this substrate, I mean, it's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to use this one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not known because it's
not being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also see that major transitions
occurred to different substrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: like flavonoids and anthocyanins are acyl
sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very infrequently, when we look at this
network in combination with the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetes, the gene 3 of these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have emerged just once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, these have emerged
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few hypotheses that we can
make based on this figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, we hypothesize that the
substrates that are within this ancestral
[SPEAKER_00]: space, we call it an ancestral space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So substrates within this space are likely
to be accessed more frequently when
[SPEAKER_00]: enzymes are evolving than an enzyme using
these substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second hypothesis was enzymes that use
substrates in the ancestral space should
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize diverse substrate classes,
polyamines, alcohols, and phenols,
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to enzymes using these
substrates, which will tend to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized and keep on using anthocyanins
or flavonoids instead of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final hypothesis was that because
these are structurally so similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization of either activity will take
only a few residue changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple residue changes can change the
activity of these enzymes and can make
[SPEAKER_00]: them more specialized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are testing those right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first hypothesis, we can see
that substrate classes, alcohols,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially alcohols, are right here,
shown in blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is that alcohols,
short-chain alcohols, appear much more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently in the gene tree of all the
characterized barred enzymes than
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are testing this in a more rigorous
fashion using phylogenetic framework in
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration with Chelsea Spex Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the initial pattern we see,
which agrees with our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second hypothesis was enzymes using
substrates in the ancestral space should
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize diverse substrate classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we purified, we are purifying
five enzymes from tomato and expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: them in E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli and performing in vitro enzyme
assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that if we, we want to test
the activities of these enzymes against
[SPEAKER_00]: different substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the example of an enzyme
reaction where we use agmatine as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate and then our CF is producing a
product with 4-Kuma-Ril-CoA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a 4-Kuma-Ril-CoA peak, which says
that the enzyme is using agmatine as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we have tested it with three
different enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: HCT is the most tested enzyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do see that HCT is using many more
substrates in the ancestral substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: classes, in the ancestral substrate space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than what was already found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and even HCT, HCT was not shown to use
shikimate and quinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only was thought to use polyamines,
but we are also seeing a shikimate
[SPEAKER_00]: activity with HCT, which is again,
agrees with our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third hypothesis was that simple
residue changes can switch the activity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ancestors substrate space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea would be, in this case,
we have orthologous groups that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: defined and we know what activity each
orthologous group of enzymes does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we take this enzyme, this
orthologous group, which is involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: phenolic ester biosynthesis and compare
the alignment with the orthologous group
[SPEAKER_00]: that isolates amines, we see that 100% of
the phenolic ester enzymes use arginine,
[SPEAKER_00]: have arginine at a particular position in
the alignment, while 0% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: amine-acidating enzymes have that
particular arginine group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jinka Weng's lab at MIT has already
done that switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was this one residue
change from arginine to an aspartate can
[SPEAKER_00]: change the activity completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The HCT enzyme begins to preferentially
use amine groups as a substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simple residue changes can switch the
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on our orthologous groups,
we have several more candidate residues
[SPEAKER_00]: that we think would be involved in these
simple residue switches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it's just, in one case it's
just one residue, but I think there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of cases where there are two or
three residues that are involved in those,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in the active site and are
important in the switching, would be
[SPEAKER_00]: important in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this part of the talk,
what we see is that bad enzymes utilize a
[SPEAKER_00]: wide variety of substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got recruited into specific metabolic
pathways at different times in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we think is that these enzymes
may inherently possess alcohol and
[SPEAKER_00]: polyamine acetylating activities,
leading to the repeated emergence,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's ancestral, because the
enzymes have it in them to do that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they get specialized,
but other times they just have those as
[SPEAKER_00]: promiscuous activities existing within the
structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are doing further experiments
to reveal the degree of promiscuity and
[SPEAKER_00]: specialization in different bad enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one question that goes, it's more
evolutionary, is are they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: selected to be robust and evolvable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by these terms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at this diamond-shaped
network of the ancestral bad substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: space, it reminded me of this figure in
this 2006 paper, where they talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: robustness and evolvability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is you need systems that are
robust at the same time they're evolvable,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that even if there are
mutations that are occurring in the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, it still does not lose its
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: The function still remains as it is,
and it's able to move across a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it can move across a large
space, it is able to access novel
[SPEAKER_00]: functions, shown here in different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you imagine this as an AC
transferase function, despite mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring in the sequence, and these
sequences evolve really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bad enzymes are really fast-evolving
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite those many mutations occurring,
you're still not losing the bad function,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're able to use the same substrate
class, but because you're accessing a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: space, you're able to then use polyamines
or long-chain alcohols or flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to reach those states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for other enzyme classes, like primary
metabolic enzymes or enzymes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: under significant selection, they may have
either low robustness or high robustness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are robust to mutational changes,
but they may not be able to access novel
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not as innovative as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this function may be important in
plant metabolism if there is selection to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain such evolvability, the ability to
use when plants go on to new ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, and they are faced with new
pollinators, new biotic or abiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses, they might require new
functions, new metabolites for the
[SPEAKER_00]: defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because these evolvable functions
are existing, within the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be able to use those functions to
create new metabolites, and that might
[SPEAKER_00]: help create novel metabolites and
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at the protein
structure, we do see some patterns that
[SPEAKER_00]: conform with that hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the barred structure,
you see this long loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a region of unstructured amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here you see alpha helices and beta
sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the protein sequence, in the
protein structure, this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptor substrate comes in from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole region is just surrounded
by a long unstructured region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when in solution, that loop might just
move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We quantified the amount of flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So y-axis is the flexibility of residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the error graph shows it's across
alignment, across 150 sequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that across all the barred
enzymes, there is this region which
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponds to this loop, which is highly
flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may just be because it's not
important to have structure in that
[SPEAKER_00]: region, or it might be kept for some
functional benefit for increased substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: permissiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so take home messages from this
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using a very multidisciplinary
approach to characterize the structural
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution applications of plant
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that I've shown a little bit that
metabolic diversity in non-modal species
[SPEAKER_00]: can be useful source of novel natural
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then characterizing novel metabolic
pathways is important for genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering of novel products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without that, we can't make those,
we can't mix and match the cassettes to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce new compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we identify the evolution and the
rules of functional diversification,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might help better enable functional
prediction, might help experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis of these genes down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't talk about these two projects,
but machine learning project is being led
[SPEAKER_00]: by Liz, who is a plant biology grad
student.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lars is the primary driver of the enzyme
function project, but Gordon is recently
[SPEAKER_00]: is a rotating student, he's the director
of the data that I showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ali is leading the convalescent project,
but Nicole is helping with the PDS with
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus-induced gene silencing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kai is a visiting postdoctoral
fellow from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's working on the co-expression project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the question is, is the sampling
of metabolites across plants being,
[SPEAKER_00]: has it been focused on specifically in the
species or has it been quite broad?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sampling has certainly been
different from how it has been done in
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In genomics, it is highly focused on model
species in each family.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see only 60, 70% of the sequences from
every family belongs to model species.
[SPEAKER_00]: In metabolomics, it has been different
because people have been looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants, which are generally
non-modal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially in China and traditional
Chinese medicine, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or in South Korea, Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those groups in India, those groups
have sampled many non-modal species,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are native to those regions for
their metabolomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that data hasn't been
deposited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major data is not well annotated,
metadata is not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult to use that information
for computational analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Algorithm development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you taken the same approach for
looking at families with captive factors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what approach?
[SPEAKER_03]: The structural approach you're using right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have not yet thought about
transcription factors in that same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the approach, in this case,
we are right now expanding from barred
[SPEAKER_00]: acetyl transferases to other enzyme
families and see if the same patterns hold
[SPEAKER_00]: in other enzyme families.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that it's not very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even within enzyme families,
it's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to transcription factors,
is it the 3D confirmation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, which the substrate is the DNA
sequence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it the specific motifs, specific
residues in the sequence that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure people will have done more
work on that because the data sets are
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to assemble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The input data sets are easier to assemble
for transcription factor interactions than
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolic interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sequence is already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in trying to predict the diversified
function or activity of these things in
terms of their enzyme activity,
beyond chaos, are there other genome
features or orthogonal data sets?
And you can think of a model to try to
predict which ones are more maybe rapidly
evolving in terms of the function.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's trying to maybe just take this
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is whether we can use
different features other than chaos to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is any pattern to which enzymes
are evolving, are differentiating faster
[SPEAKER_00]: in their substrate use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be certainly people are looking
at various features of the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence itself, which is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: For enzyme families, people focus mostly
on the active site and active site
[SPEAKER_00]: residues that are important for catalysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know yet for many enzyme
families the specific residues that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Suri's group at Stanford is exactly
using, she's trying to utilize for which
[SPEAKER_00]: are enzymes, for the active sites that are
known, she's trying to use that and model
[SPEAKER_00]: that into machine learning algorithms,
predict functions of enzyme family
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another is some other features are just
similarity, the position in the
[SPEAKER_00]: phylogenetic tree compared to different
lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in terms of genomic features,
there are, yeah, for enzyme families,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes complicated because of the
promiscuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another approach called
statistical coupling analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we are using now to figure out if
there is any pattern of association
[SPEAKER_00]: between residues that are coupled to each
other statistically and their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a difficult problem to solve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just thinking if there was
some other features across your tree of
life at your show.
Perhaps some features may only be
important for a play or for a family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geneva, are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we only focused on parallels for this
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parallels of biosynthetically
characterized enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew exactly what substrates they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they used multiple substrates,
we used all of those substrates in this
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there are no more questions,
we'll move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
