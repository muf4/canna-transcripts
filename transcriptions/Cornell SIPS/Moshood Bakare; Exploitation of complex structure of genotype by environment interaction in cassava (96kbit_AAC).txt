[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I would like to talk to you about
exploitation of complex structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype by environment interaction in
cassava root crop using IT cassava
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program as a case study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multi-environment trials allow breeder
to screen for genotypic reaction to a
[SPEAKER_00]: range of environmental condition,
a phenomenon people refer to as a genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: by environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kind of trial is usually conducted at
uniform year trial at the late stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: evaluation prior to release of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of statistical methods have been
proposed for exploiting genotype by
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So among them are linear by linear models
such as additive male effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: multiplicative interaction model,
site regression model, factor analytic
[SPEAKER_00]: model, and multivariate multi-environment
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principal objectives of this study
is to assess complex structure of G by E
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction by identifying optimal model
which prefer various covalent structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're also interested in estimating
genetic merit of individual genotype
[SPEAKER_00]: toward identification of stable genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to achieve this objective, we tried to
put together a total number of 30 trials
[SPEAKER_00]: across nine locations in three growing
seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those trials were established as
randomized complete block design interior
[SPEAKER_00]: replicates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, we have a total number of 116
genotypes evaluated across 30 trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this study, we intend to make use of
R, SAS, and ASRMO for the analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see from this table,
this showed the number of trials for
[SPEAKER_00]: individual environment and across the
growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that the data exhibit a
kind of unbalanced structures for the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that the number of trial building from one
location to the other and from one growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start with, we tried to come up with
these concrete metrics to have idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of genotypes that is common to any
person and to have idea of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key message here is that those
environment that have high number of
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype in common, so there is high
likelihood of sharing common information
[SPEAKER_00]: than those environment that have less
genotype in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, we went ahead to have idea
of the distribution of the root yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is our key trait of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key message from this box plot is
that the yield seem to exhibit a gross
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution from one environment to the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see that the mean is
approximately equal to the median.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another key message from this plot is that
there is heterogeneity of genetic variance
[SPEAKER_00]: across the environment, meaning that this
suggests the presence of genotype by
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we all know that in the
multi-environment trial, the same trait
[SPEAKER_00]: measured in different environment can be
considered to be a different trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to look at Pearson
correlations among those environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see that there are some number
of environment where the correlation is
[SPEAKER_00]: very high and positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means there is less of G by E or
no G by E in those kind of environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some with positive correlation
that are very low, meaning that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to be G by E in those environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have some environment that are
very contrasting in the sense that the
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation is perfect and negative,
which suggests that there is likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: presence of G by E, high G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a visual approach of assessing
the presence of G by E or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were ahead to assess the presence of
G by E numerically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are trying to test hypothesis
that there is no G by E against
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative hypothesis that there is G by
E, meaning that the variance of G by E is
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fit this nested model for the null
hypothesis without inclusion of genital by
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this same model is reparameterized by
inclusion of genital by environment
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result we got from the
nested model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the various component
estimated for each of these effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the similarity for the full model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the various component
attributed to each of these factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to see whether the inclusion
of G by E is significant or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have to carry out likelihood ratio
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by looking at different between log
likelihood of nested model and full model,
[SPEAKER_00]: so which approximate chi-square
distribution with degree of freedom equal
[SPEAKER_00]: to the difference in the number of the
parameter estimated, and which seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which tell us that the inclusion of G
by E makes sense and that cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here from this model,
you can see that the variance attributed
[SPEAKER_00]: to G by E is more than twice that of
genetic effect, which means that G by E is
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic variance is specific to
environment and is very large and G by E
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important and cannot be ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this study, so we went ahead to see if
we should assume that the arrow bearers is
[SPEAKER_00]: similar across all those 30 environment or
are they heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead by fitting the full
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we assume that arrow
bearers is heterogeneous in each of those
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fit the nested model, which assume
that the residual bearers is uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across all the 30 environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the result we get by fitting
the full model.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, the arrow bearers range
from 2.4 to 99.66.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the nested model, which assume one
uniform arrow bearers across all the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment give us this result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as usual, we carry out the likelihood
ratio test, which confirmed that as some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of arrow bearers heterogeneity makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be taken into consideration
so that the result from the analysis will
[SPEAKER_00]: not mislead us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the next couple of slides,
I'll talk about different kind of bearers
[SPEAKER_00]: for various structures we feed in the
course of trying to explore the complex
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started by fitting compass symmetry
model, which is the most restrictive of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this kind of model assume that the
genetic bearers within the environment is
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the covariance or correlation between
any pair of environment is also uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this model may not be realistic going
by what we saw in the previous slide that
[SPEAKER_00]: the arrow bearers is heterogeneous,
the genetic bearers within the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: is uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a heterogeneous as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is extract from the model we
fitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 30 by 30 matrices, but there's no
way we can visualize everything at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, along the principal
diagonal, those are the genetic bearers
[SPEAKER_00]: within the environment, which are uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the diagonal, that is the correlation
between any pair of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead to fit compass symmetry
heterogeneous model, which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: extension of the previous model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, the correlation between any pair
of environment is uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what make it different from the
previous model is that the genetic bearers
[SPEAKER_00]: across the environment is heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the result obtained from that
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, along the principal
diagonal, these are the genetic bearers
[SPEAKER_00]: estimated in each of the environment,
which is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of the diagonal is the correlation,
pairwise correlation between environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another form of model we
fitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the most liberal of all the
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is liberal in the sense that it's fit
full G by E without structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this kind of model, we assume that
each environment has unique genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: bearers and correlation between any pair
of environment is also unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fitted this kind of model, you have to
estimate quite a large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take for example, we start a number of
trials in our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we are going to estimate
around 465 parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to fit it and this is the error
message we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means it is not only computational
inefficient to fit this kind of model,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also computational prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fitted a factor analytic model as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor analytic model is nothing but just
a mismodeled analog of ARMY, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: additive, made, defective, and
multiplicative interaction model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a model that is a kind of lower
order approximation to unstructured
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with factor analytic model,
you can identify the latest common factor
[SPEAKER_00]: that capture and explain the G by E
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, this is how the
structures of the factor analytic models
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this component phi is specific bearers
in each of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this square of loadings plus these
specific bearers will give you the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: bearers in each of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using this to illustrate when you fit
factor analytic model of other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the diagonal is the genetic
covariance between any pair of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a matter of dividing this
genetic covariance by the square root of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product of these various and these
various, if you're interested in knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic correlation between any pair
of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after fitting all these sort of models,
so we try to use a goodness of fit
[SPEAKER_00]: statistic to be able to identify the best
model that explain the complex pattern in
[SPEAKER_00]: G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from attack information
criterion, so tell us that a factor
[SPEAKER_00]: analytic model of other two is the most
parsimonious model explaining the complex
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of G by E.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 114 parameters and by looking at BIC,
it identified complex symmetry as the best
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people prefer to use AKK
information criteria simply because the
[SPEAKER_00]: BIC imposes every penalty on the complex
model by identifying a simpler model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go for AKK information criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after identify factor analytic model,
factor analytic model of other two,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean by other two is that we have
two multiplicative components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is the result we obtain from
factor analytic model for that two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first two column here, that is what
you call the latent common factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: which explain the complex pattern of G by
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this column here, that is what you
call environment specific variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, this is the variance in
nature of this environment that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: captured by these latent common factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one good thing about this factor
analytic model is that when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: information about environmental
co-variables like precipitation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperatures, so you can decide to
look at correlation of those environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: co-variables with this latent common
factor to be able to identify which of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental co-variable is very relevant
in explaining G by E interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from this factor analytic model,
from these latent factors, so when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take the square of these and this plus
this one, that will give you the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: variance in each of these environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key message here is that our factor
analytic model of other two capture a
[SPEAKER_00]: total of 60.9% of the variations where the
first component and the second component
[SPEAKER_00]: accounted for 42.1 and 18.8% of the
variation respectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lesson learned and taken message
from this study is that the compass
[SPEAKER_00]: symmetry model fits a simple G by E
structures that are very easy to fit and
[SPEAKER_00]: confide easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are recommended if a better fitting
conveyor structure cannot be found,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they do not provide better
understanding of G by E structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unstructured model is computationally
demanding as the number of environments
[SPEAKER_00]: will try to keep increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in analysis of multi-environment
trials, it is very rare for people to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this model because you may end up having a
solution that is not converged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Factor analytic model is very parsimonious
and an effective approach for dissecting G
[SPEAKER_00]: by E in a situation where you have a large
number of trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next step is to see how we can
identify a subset of environment with and
[SPEAKER_00]: without crossover in these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also plan to incorporate sleep
marker data into the model to see how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can capture the relationship among those
genotypes.
