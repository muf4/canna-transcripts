[SPEAKER_00]: ffacwylwyr, Donald a Praveen Kumar,
who've all helped in doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and Darren Drury, who was a postdoc,
working with me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I work, the Institute of
Genomic Biology at the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: In front of that are the Morrow Plots,
the oldest agricultural experiment outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of Rothamstead, England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to show this sort of
connection that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the film work I'll show you is
done very close to this location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the work shows an interplay
between lab modelling and film work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope that'll be apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we concerned about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is debated, there is no debate
about the fact that the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in the atmosphere is rising,
and it's really rising at a quite
[SPEAKER_00]: unprecedented rate in geological history
at the present time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our crop ancestors evolved in the
average CO2 concentration of the last 10
[SPEAKER_00]: million years, which was about 220 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're over 400 parts per million,
so we're close to doubling what those crop
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors evolved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at what is driving climate
change in the atmosphere, then CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, is the biggest contributor to
this, but also methane, nitrous oxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: halocarbons are an important part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one that's often overlooked is
tropospheric ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most greenhouse gases are heteroatomic
molecules, carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrous oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ozone also behaves as a heteroatomic
molecule, and it absorbs infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a part of the greenhouse effect
when it's in the troposphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the stratosphere, of course,
it's important in absorbing UV radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our activities have greatly increased
ozone in the troposphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ozone is also toxic to plants,
so it has a direct effect as well as an
[SPEAKER_00]: indirect effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aerosols actually cause a cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase in cloud cover as we warm up the
atmosphere has a feedback effect as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, the anthropogenic effect is
strongly positive, leading to increased
[SPEAKER_00]: energy in the troposphere, so that is
predicted to lead to, on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: a one to two degree C temperature rise by
2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, although precipitation is rising,
drought is also rising, because with
[SPEAKER_00]: rising temperature, we have more
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, with increased energy in the
atmosphere, events become more intense,
[SPEAKER_00]: more chaotic, so this will probably also
lead to more drought events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that surface ozone today averages
about 50 parts per billion in the Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that will rise to between 60 to
90 parts per billion, depending on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: really controls proposed by a number of
countries bite or whether they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this rises actually south of us
in the tropics, particularly in East Asia
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, but these are really,
if you like, four major global change
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that our crops will have to face by
2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed are facing already,
because, as I said, the crop ancestors
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved in the CO2 concentration that is
very different to the one we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, tropospheric ozone,
we think pre-industrially was probably no
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 10 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, it averages 50 parts per billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We frequently see 100 parts per billion in
central Illinois today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the impacts of rising CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how might we adapt to rising CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the three things I want to try and
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, as I showed yesterday,
our four major crops globally in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you like, these are the crops that
provide over two-thirds, directly or
[SPEAKER_00]: indirectly, of human calories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maize is number one, and it's C4,
so it has a different response to rising
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice and wheat, on the other hand,
are C3, very important as direct sources
[SPEAKER_00]: of human calories, and then soy,
a very important protein source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those last three are all C3 crops and
should respond very strongly to rising
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I showed yesterday, we're
responsible for, the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: produces almost a third of the world's soy
production, a very significant part of
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat production, and over a third of
maize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we look at how we're improving the
yield of these crops, then if we take the
[SPEAKER_00]: historical trajectory and we say,
well, we ought to be able to continue that
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future, then we would end up at
this point by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what FAO and John Foley's group at
Minnesota have projected is that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what we will need by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we really need to get onto this
trajectory because staying on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: will result in significant shortages,
significant price increases that will
[SPEAKER_00]: affect the poorest in the global
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should also point out that I've just
added on here cassava.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassava is a crop which many smallholders,
poor communities, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sub-Saharan Africa, depend on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these yield improvements which
we show for our major crops are not
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent in some of these what we might
call minor crops, but actually extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important crops for those communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have failed to improve those at the
rate that we're improving our best crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: or rather, I shouldn't say our best crops,
if you like our top crops, the ones which
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly matter to the developed
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture, though, is a little bit worse
because if we look at these rice and
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat, for example, the same is true of
soy, that if we look at during the Green
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution years, then we were improving
average global yields by 30% to 40% per
[SPEAKER_00]: decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, a huge change in global food supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really eliminated the major famines
that had been seen in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Green Revolution had a huge impact
at that stage, but as we move away,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see that wheat and rice, really the
yield improvements, are declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in the last decade,
wheat wasn't improved at all and rice is
[SPEAKER_00]: now in single figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just want to put up an equation
developed by John Monteith at Rothamsted,
[SPEAKER_00]: which explains at least why we may be
running out of steam with genetic yield
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield a crop will achieve when it's
grown under optimum conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no diseases, no pests, adequate water
and adequate nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this tells us is that the yield
of a crop will depend on how much sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: is available for photosynthesis by the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should say here we're just
interested in the visible sunlight because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is all plants use in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good they are at capturing that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is the efficiency with which they
capture it during the growing season?
[SPEAKER_00]: How efficient are they at then converting
that captured light into biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, how good are they at
partitioning that biomass into the parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the crop we care about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the grain of wheat, the grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just data for a soybean crop
on our university farm, a modern soybean
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, not growing with irrigation,
but growing on a deep Midwest soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of water available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what we see is that
interception efficiency and partitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency are already remarkably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, in the case of rice and
wheat, these are products of the green
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we changed in rice and
wheat, that partitioning efficiencies went
[SPEAKER_00]: up from 30% to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interception efficiencies improved as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we really look at these,
these are pretty well hitting on their
[SPEAKER_00]: biological maxima.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there isn't really much more we can
squeeze out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what I should point out is this
number, conversion efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is really a very good number for
most crops, a 3%, is only a third of the
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, conversion efficiency photosynthesis
is one thing where there's an opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: still to improve on yield potential,
genetic yield potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how does CO2 tie into this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does CO2 do to crop plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from a theoretical point of view,
the only way a plant can sense CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 changes at the levels that we're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a plant in 10% CO2,
then you change its pH and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things start to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just, for example, elevate CO2
from where we are today to where we think
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd be in the latter half of this
century, there are only really two ways a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can sense this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the key carboxylase in
photosynthesis, rubisco, is not CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated and it also catalyzes a process
called photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 increases saturation of rubisco and it
inhibits that oxygenation reaction which
[SPEAKER_00]: leads to photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's sensed at rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also sensed at the level of stomata
and how this happens is not fully
[SPEAKER_00]: understood, but stomata will close in
response to rising CO2 and we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how much of that is really a direct
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you strip off the epidermis of many
plants, float them on water, subject them
[SPEAKER_00]: to elevated CO2, you will see a closing
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it was thought for many years that
respiration was also affected by CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: People took out their, some of you may be
familiar with LiCo gas exchange systems or
[SPEAKER_00]: other gas exchange systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put these on plants, elevated the CO2
in the chamber and they saw a suppression
[SPEAKER_00]: of respiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were very suspicious that what's
going on is it's very difficult to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 from leaking out of these systems,
completely prevent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what we've eventually managed to
do was get a manufacturer who could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually give us a differential oxygen
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was about a year of work,
so that we could instead measure oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, which is much more of a challenge
because there is so much more oxygen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we eventually got this working to
our satisfaction, the postdoc in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: who was doing it was saying, well,
I'm doubling CO2 and I'm not seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I said, well, put through 1% CO2 and
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put through 1% CO2 and we saw
absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we published that in Plant Physiology
and I think the idea that CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing respiration has gone away now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at least we can, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can simplify what really a plant can
see in terms of CO2 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at the level of rubisco, what CO2 is
doing is CO2, of course, is the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: for conversion of IUBP to two molecules of
phosphoglycolate in the Calvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oxygen also reacts, catalyzed by
rubisco, because that's why there's the O
[SPEAKER_00]: on the end of rubisco, to produce
glycolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If glycolate is produced, then the plant
recycles that back to PGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in doing so, it loses a carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consumes a great deal of the NADPH and
ATP generated by the light reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it imposes an inefficiency on the
overall photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you elevate CO2, you do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You increase the saturation of rubisco
with CO2 and you competitively inhibit
[SPEAKER_00]: this oxygenation reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that is why glasshouse growers,
it's worth their while elevating their
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato crop with CO2, because they get a
high yield precisely because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's harder when it comes to field
crops, though, to assess what CO2 will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, a lot of the information we have
comes from chamber systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses, controlled environments,
and also small chambers put over crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you do this, even in the field
situation, you're changing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lowering the light level,
you're raising temperature a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're raising humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're completely altering coupling with
the movement of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got edge effects, because often
the crop around the edges of this has been
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked down and so light's coming in from
the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we were really basing much of our
prediction on what would happen on crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: on very artificial systems, that Monsanto
or Syngenta would never use plots this
[SPEAKER_00]: size to decide whether their latest
transgene is doing anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want an open crop field, many of
them, to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, we are basically predicting our
future on experiments much smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: much simpler than industry would ever use
for its business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I moved to Illinois, there was a
chance there, particularly with the
[SPEAKER_00]: university farm and a big engineering
school, to do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was something I actually first
developed for work with ozone and
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric pollutants by Andrew MacLeod
in the UK, and then was taken up by
[SPEAKER_00]: Brookhaven National Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I worked there in the early 90s,
and then when I moved to Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a chance to really refine that,
which is what we did, and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: engineers did, I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what these systems do is
that here we have our soybean crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do the same thing in maize,
and also this has been done with wheat and
[SPEAKER_00]: rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given our design to groups in China,
which have now done this very successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: with rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what happens is,
if the wind is coming in this direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sensed here, and CO2 is released on
the upwind side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's feathered so that most is released
immediately upwind and then less as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's stepped according to the wind
speed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the centre, we have a CO2 analyser,
an infrared analyser, to check that the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm is doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it is over, it backs it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's under, it releases more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here you can see a test of the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We switch it on at this point,
and with target it's 550 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets within plus or minus 10% of
that target for about 96% of the time over
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an infrared image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, as I said, CO2 causes
partial stomatial closure, so the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are transpiring less, they're losing less
latent heat, therefore they get warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see that it's warmer within
the ring, and that's fairly uniform
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of my former students and one of
my former post-docs both went away from
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois and then came back as faculty,
and they're now doing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Andrew Leakey has developed a rain-out
shelter system where actually this deploys
[SPEAKER_00]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get about two thirds of our
rainfall, in fact, in the Corn Belt due to
[SPEAKER_00]: convection or storms, so if the thing
senses rain, it deploys a shelter which
[SPEAKER_00]: collects the rain in the gutter pipes that
are away from the site, and he imposes a
[SPEAKER_00]: drought here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carl has developed an open-air heating
system so he can raise the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the crop within these rings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've now got CO2, drought and
temperature combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the experiment, we've got those
added on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These rings are about 20-metre diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you over 300 square metres of
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do a lot of things with that
that you can't do with a small system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at everything from gene
expression to the final yield harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: with a small plot combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have four of these in soybean and
replicated in maize that are in CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: four in elevated ozone, four looking at
the combination and then controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have split plots with the
temperature and drought treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also looked at a range of cultivars
in there as well, although for most
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, 26 is way too small to really do
any breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could replicate this technology up
to much larger areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find when we did this under
the open air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I should say this has also been
done with wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an experiment in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an experiment in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been more of those around
the world, but too few, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this shows soybean and wheat data from
different chamber experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can fit a line to those against
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what we found in our FACE
experiment, because that's just one CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically we're finding what we see
under open air conditions is about half of
[SPEAKER_00]: what have been reported on average in
chamber conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with maize, the picture was even
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this is the projection from chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, many of these plants are
grown in, but they're all pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, nearly all grown in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we see in the open air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no stimulation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done this now over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still haven't seen the yield increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lisa Ainsworth looked at this in more
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was published in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2008, there were twice as many FACE
experiments to draw on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she showed again that what you see in
the open air, the nearest proxy to a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer's field, was only half of what was
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: The modelers, I think, are still not
convinced of our results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the latest IPCC, they're
suggesting that rising CO2 will rescue us
[SPEAKER_00]: from the problems of rising temperature
and drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't subscribe to that view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if there's doubt about it,
we should be trying to look at how we
[SPEAKER_00]: could adapt to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't need it, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we do, it'll be too late if we
don't start doing something now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at, go back to John
Monteith's equations, what we see is
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed conversion efficiency at the crop
level is increased, and that plays through
[SPEAKER_00]: to yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only about half of what we think
we should get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how might we adapt to that rising CO2
and try and get the kind of yield increase
[SPEAKER_00]: we think we should obtain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is something we started when I
was working on the project, but Lisa
[SPEAKER_00]: Ainsworth has now taken this much further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're doing here is looking at
genetic variation in response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at seed yield,
a range of cultivars, we can see that this
[SPEAKER_00]: basically means no response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up here, we've got cultivars that are
clearly responding more strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears there are some genetics
there that could be exploited to adapt the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, to do this, you would need,
if you like, a much larger face system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd need it in different locations
because we're pretty well in the centre of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soybean growing area, but there's
plenty of soybean grown in Minnesota,
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty grown south of us where growing
season lengths conditions are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does suggest that this is something
that could well be exploited.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major issues is really around
this rubisco issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know from theory what should happen,
which should be about a 30% yield
[SPEAKER_00]: increase, and we can sometimes see that in
chamber experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in practice, we're getting a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, CO2 is, if you like,
suppressing photorespiration and enhancing
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But temperature has the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature makes rubisco less specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as temperature increases, rubisco
becomes less able to discriminate between
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and CO2, and photorespiration goes
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you model this from rubisco
kinetics, put that into a crop canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you'll see is that this is the actual
gain you get with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, this is the actual photosynthesis
at the canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you could get if you
eliminated photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gain, that difference becomes
much bigger with rising temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got two things going on,
rising CO2 and rising temperature working
[SPEAKER_00]: against each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one way in which this could be
overcome synthetically is, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: C4 photosynthesis is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could make these crops C4,
then we could overcome this problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way, and Maureen Hanson and I have
both been involved in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that cyanobacteria, the ancestors of
the chloroplasts, also have these bodies
[SPEAKER_00]: called carboxysomes, which contain their
rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actively take up bicarbonate into
their cells, and they also will hydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: any CO2 as well, so that out here you have
a high concentration of bicarbonate and no
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this body called the carboxysome,
they have carbonic anhydrase, which
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyses the conversion of bicarbonate to
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a very high concentration of
CO2 here, which the rubisco can take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a high concentration of
CO2, they do not have photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an active effort now to try and
engineer this system into the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be one way of dealing with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin McGrath, who's been working with
Maureen and myself on modelling this
[SPEAKER_00]: system, has developed a diffusion reaction
model which really looks at all these
[SPEAKER_00]: components and the sequence in which this
would ideally be engineered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what he shows is,
in theory, if you could put this into a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop plant like soybean, you could get
almost up to a 60% increase in CO2 uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Will Hay, working with Tom Clementi
and myself, put in just one cyanobacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: gene whose function is still really
unknown, but there's quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence that it appears to improve CO2
access to rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Will, using soybean, transformed
with this one gene, showed that
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis was indeed increased,
seed mass was increased, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important findings he made
was that the maximum efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: light-limited photosynthesis went up,
and this was statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only really three ways in
which this is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a different rubisco, which seems
highly unlikely because the large subunit
[SPEAKER_00]: at least doesn't have multiple forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more oxygen, which again,
sorry, less oxygen, which again is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely difficult because there's 21%
outside, so inside it's probably 29%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other way is to have more CO2 at
rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this seemed good evidence that that
was what was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just mention, of course, not everything is
predictable, and I showed examples
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday with pests of soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things we see with,
and this was a bit of a shock,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that under elevated CO2, and I hope
it's apparent there, the crop is green at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the growing season when it's
yellow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, it should have been the other
way round because the crop's warmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat accelerates development, and it
should have gone yellow inside before it
[SPEAKER_00]: was green outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the engineer at the site,
I was telling him, tell me when it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow inside because I want to take a
picture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept calling him every morning and
he said no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually he sheepishly said,
I think it's green inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, oh, that can't be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out there and sure enough,
it was green inside the ring and yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by boosting photosynthesis,
and carbohydrate supply, it appears that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've delayed senescence of the crop
because this crop is genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's all in the same field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this was very intriguing because what
we then found was these are the wild type
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean, same generation as these ones
which were transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the season, boosting
photosynthesis appeared to delay
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was another very interesting
parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These transgenic plants appeared just like
the wild type ones, given more CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'll move on from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the ways which we could adapt
the plant to rising CO2 is exactly around
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue of rubisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at the response of
photosynthesis to the CO2 inside the leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're eliminating a stomatal effect in
this diagram, what we see is that as we
[SPEAKER_00]: increase CO2, photosynthesis increases
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it reaches a transition point where
it rises more slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is happening here is that you're
saturating the carbon with an oxidation
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction of rubisco, and then when you get
to this point, you now become limited by
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply of RuBP, not directly by the
supply of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see there's still a rise here,
and the reason for this is although RuBP
[SPEAKER_00]: is limiting, because you're increasing
CO2, you're progressively inhibiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenation reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more of that limiting supply of RuBP is
being used in photosynthesis and less in
[SPEAKER_00]: photoraspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what we tend to find is at current
CO2 levels, so at a given stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: conductance, what will happen is as we
increase photosynthesis, the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration inside the leaf will drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because photosynthesis is removing CO2,
the stomates are limiting that CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: so inside the leaf you have lower CO2 than
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, inside and outside are the
same, and what we typically find,
[SPEAKER_00]: this point, the operating point,
is very close to this transition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf has optimised its investment in
rubisco versus apparatus for regenerating
[SPEAKER_00]: RuBP.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, if we move out to an elevated CO2
situation, we've unbalanced this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now got far more rubisco than we
need, and we're limited entirely by the
[SPEAKER_00]: apparatus for regeneration of RuBP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in theory, what we could do is we could
decrease rubisco, and if you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could have the same photosynthetic
rate, but be more nitrogen use efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: because rubisco is about 25% of the
nitrogen in the leaf, so it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could use that resource instead to
increase capacity for regeneration of RuBP
[SPEAKER_00]: and have, for the same amount of nitrogen,
have even more CO2 fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, a question that you might
ask is, well, does the plant know this?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow it under elevated CO2,
does it acclimate in this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are data that Kalbanaki took
during his PhD work, where indeed the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant seems to know a little bit of this,
and what he found was there was a decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: in this initial slope and a slight rise in
the plateau, but it was nowhere near
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to reach the theoretical gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I should... So one of the other
things we looked at was this issue of
[SPEAKER_00]: regeneration, and Jingwan Zhu,
who was a graduate student in the lab at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as Karl, worked with me on
developing a complete model of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, where we represented the
whole system by a series of linked
[SPEAKER_00]: differential equations that we eventually
got to replicate what the leaf was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of CO2 uptake in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this just shows some of the classic
responses we see, if you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: in one of these cuvettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just shows that we could simulate
these responses with the model,
[SPEAKER_00]: so these dynamic responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could then use the system to basically
optimize investment, so we could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, apply, if you like, an evolutionary
algorithm to say, okay, where should we be
[SPEAKER_00]: investing to regenerate RUBP more
efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it picked out, in particular,
this one enzyme, SBPAs, but there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of other changes it suggested,
FBPAs as well, FBP-aldolase, all of which
[SPEAKER_00]: we're now looking at, particularly in
tobacco, but probably we'll test in
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleague Christine Rains in
England did this with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are plants in the glass house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put those out in our soy face
experiment and replicated in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we found, though,
was that, and I'll skip over this,
[SPEAKER_00]: was that under elevated CO2, the response
was even greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that got us intrigued, you know,
because it fits in with the theory I
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it should be greater under elevated
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the other things we went back to
with the model was to say, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was curious that SBPAs is a really very
small amount of the total protein in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, it would be very easy for a
plant to evolve more SBPAs at a very low
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we re-ran the model at 220 parts per
million, per billion, per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, the concentration under which we
think the crop ancestors evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, sorry, we looked at flux control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in the model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it suggested, well, SBPAs would
invert, would have no control over CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation under those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at 390 ppm, it would have a strong
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 700, it would be even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rubisco would be moving in the
opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was consistent with what we saw in
these experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just very briefly mention this,
but another thing that we also have done
[SPEAKER_00]: with modelling is Rubisco appears to have
a trade-off that this specificity factor,
[SPEAKER_00]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: where plant, if you like, we think that
plants have evolved to become obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific for CO2 against a very
strong oxygen background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find that crop plants tend to have a
specificity of 90 in favour of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you go out to C4 plants,
where the Rubisco is in a high CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, or bacteria, where they might
be in anaerobic environments, specificity
[SPEAKER_00]: drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But catalytic rate increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thinking is that to get tighter
binding, catalytic rate has to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to cut a long story short,
what we found was that there should be an
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum at any CO2 concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found was that that optimum was a
specificity of about 90 at 220 ppm,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which the plant's probably evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, it's much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'd be a big advantage in,
if you like, getting in a foreign Rubisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might have a lower specificity,
but a higher Kcat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we modelled this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amaranthus edulis Rubisco, which is C4,
actually fits these specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the model, it would give you about
a 70% gain for no increase in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could replace the lower canopy
Rubisco with a further different Rubisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get up to 30% gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when we did that, that all seemed a
bit pie in the sky, because Rubisco's
[SPEAKER_00]: coded for in both the plastid and the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely difficult to put into practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a picture from the paper in
Nature from Maureen's group and Martin
[SPEAKER_00]: Parry's in Rothamstead, where they've
really shown you can take very distant
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubiscos, get them into tobacco,
and at least you can get the plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things are becoming, as the
technology moves forward, these things are
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming more and more possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I just want to sort of point out
you can also apply this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolutionary algorithm at the canopy
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Darren Drury, working with me as a
postdoc, did this with, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: soybean canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go into all the details of
this, but basically what he showed was
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could, by changing canopy leaf
reflectivity, the angles of the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: optimising those, and also the number of
leaves, you could get quite a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: gain in carbon uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also, for warmer environments,
you could cool the canopy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know now some of the genes,
for example, that determine hinging of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, so these things are becoming
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tie them in with phytochrome
responses, promoters for phytochrome
[SPEAKER_00]: responses, so they do a different thing at
the top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things it predicted was
that actually soybeans produce too many
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, that if they invested in fewer
leaves, you would get more gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, of course, we were thinking of
what genotype might be available in which
[SPEAKER_00]: we could test this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Venkat, the graduate student who was
working with us at the time, was an
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd done the modelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wasn't in on the conversations we
had about genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, he started an replicated
experiment in the field where he cut off
[SPEAKER_00]: every fourth emerging leaf so that he was
preventing the plant from investing in
[SPEAKER_00]: these extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he found was that, sorry,
every third developing leaf, what he got
[SPEAKER_00]: was a significant 10% increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seem to be two reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that the canopy actually has more
leaves than it really needs, so its
[SPEAKER_00]: respiratory load, by having extra leaves,
actually outweighs the gain of more
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, of course, in an evolutionary sense,
this might be beneficial, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know when a herbivore's going to
come along and remove half of what you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a farmer's field, it's a
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is, by cutting them off early,
you prevent the plant from investing
[SPEAKER_00]: resource in that developing leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it resulted in an increase in yield,
and we've done that two years running now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it involves quite a lot of
undergraduate time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we had a field assimilation chamber
where we could actually test out the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that it really is resulting in a higher
net CO2 uptake as well as a high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I mentioned yesterday, with Gates
Foundation funding, we've now got a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to test many of these ideas in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, to summarise, I think there is a
very serious problem that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially going to have a shortfall in
primary foodstuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are arguments against that,
but I don't think we should be taking
[SPEAKER_00]: chances.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be ensuring ourselves against an
uncertain future, both in human behaviour
[SPEAKER_00]: and in climate driven by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential yield increases of rising
CO2 are not fully realised in our current
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are genetic and biotech
solutions, although field facilities are
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously lacking to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just not willing to spend what we
need to spend on those field facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be a tiny fraction of the cost
we're putting into other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: DOE just spent £100 million near us
drilling into the deep rocks to see if it
[SPEAKER_00]: could capture a small amount of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be enough to pay for breeding
facilities at least three sites around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country to actually adapt to these
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, again, finished by thanking all
the people who've made this possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I should mention this is
Jing Wan Zhu, and Donald, my colleague,
[SPEAKER_00]: has worked closely with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa Ainsworth and Andrew Leakey have
mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Carl is somewhere in these pictures,
but with that I finish and thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University, on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
