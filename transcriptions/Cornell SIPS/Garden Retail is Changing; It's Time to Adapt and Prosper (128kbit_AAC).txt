[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you a little bit about some of
the things that have been going on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here thinks the industry is anything
like it was in 2007?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all know it's changed quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the recession had a huge
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that generally speaking,
our industry is somewhat immune to
[SPEAKER_00]: recessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still own their homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People still want to invest in their
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may cancel going out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a nicer vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they continue investing in their
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to dwell too long on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with so many people losing their
homes, our industry was deeply impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no new buildings going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no new homes going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, the demand for plants was
starting to die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say a good number of people
went out of business in that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, garden retailers are retiring in
huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what was going on in the 70s
and 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like a baby boom for garden
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in here are garden
retailers?
[SPEAKER_00]: A handful of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many here are less than 55 years old
who own a garden center?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who own a garden center?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're serving garden retail,
or if you're someone who own it yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ownership is going to be going through
a huge, huge change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody wants to retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's no big secret there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to go into each one of these
a little bit more deeply here in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant retail is moving away from the term
garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word gardening is beginning to not be
all that popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So owners are retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens with when they retire?
[SPEAKER_00]: About a third of them have family members
or employees who are buying or inheriting
[SPEAKER_00]: the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, you're selling the business and
the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to sell the business,
and this is where the timing is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really poor.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the 2008 recession, if you were not
making a profit for the last three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult to sell your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selling the inventory, and you're
selling the land you're sitting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, these people have been able
to turn around before they retire and able
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not able to sell your
business, hopefully you're able to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the land, if you own the land,
if you're not leasing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sell the land and the inventory,
if you don't have a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you work until you can't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your other option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't sell anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of retailers I know who are looking
to retire, they have like a five-year
[SPEAKER_00]: selling plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go ahead and quietly put their
business up for sale so they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: several years to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like selling a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are supplying plants to people
who have a retail business, keep that in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind, because that's a very different
mindset for those who are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not necessarily reinvesting in
their company unless they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it, or they have someone else to pass
it on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be a challenge for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the same time, plant retail is not
just plant retail anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get this out of my hand here
a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be pretty, but there we
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just plant retail anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of retailers are going into having
services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just landscaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about the traditional
landscape services.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about going to a customer's
home and doing a sketch of a layout for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So landscape extremely light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it might be going in and changing out
patio pots for them, or putting up
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas decorations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product mix is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The types of plants that they're selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously, annuals are still
keying, but we track that every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask retailers about how their plant
sales are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And annuals and perennials are still
keying, but shrubs and trees and the large
[SPEAKER_00]: perennials and a lot of those things have
been quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hearing good news about the
larger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the past several years,
they've been going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And food and garden are blending.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of retailers are actually
starting to host farmers markets at their
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either giving space to people who
have farmers markets, or they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming the farmer market managers for
it, or they're hosting CSAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also selling a lot of food
plants and edibles and also produce
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're beginning to see kind of this
blend of the farm market and the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is happening more on the garden
retail side than it is on the farm market
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not seeing as many plants going
into the farm markets as you are produce
[SPEAKER_00]: going into garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beginning to act as a community
hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have, especially in the
wintertime when they have all that space
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the greenhouse, I'm seeing more
and more garden centers, they're either
[SPEAKER_00]: leasing or donating the space they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where the Lions Club meets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where sometimes town councils
have their meetings where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: community get togethers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of auctions that
begin happening so that they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: use that space when it's not full of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are going to impact
how we're selling plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the traditional model of
what we're doing isn't at all what it used
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're setting up shop where
consumers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're beginning to see the pop ups
that are coming around, but they aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: just on the corner of a busy street
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing them in the farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing them like a little stand
outside the popular craft beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, location and that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're beginning to see them at festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where consumers are is drawing retail
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very small footprint,
generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so consumers are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you a little background here
on this section here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here is tired of hearing about
millennials and how they behave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been working with Bridget Behe with
Michigan State and Susan Hogan with Emory
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she was with Emory University a year
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: She got lured away by Deloitte and Touche
for a very big salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the past three years, since 2013,
we have been doing consumer research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to know, well,
what we really wanted to do was only
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to figure out how we can expand
the number of people who garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we started looking at,
we wanted to know what are the barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to find out what people think
about garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they think about gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they think about plants and their
own yards and their lifestyles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also wanted to figure out what
kind of marketing messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stage two was to go to the PR type
people in the advertising firms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stage three was then to recruit
real world garden centers to implement
[SPEAKER_00]: these marketing messages and see how they
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to go over here is going to
be about the research we've done and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to look at those who are under
50 for our research for a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bridget Behe has been looking at consumers
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who are over 50, if they're not
gardening, they have a very good reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why they're not gardening anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've moved into a condo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to convert that
group as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our goal was to expand people who
garden, which means we need to get those
[SPEAKER_00]: who are more ignorant about gardening or
have not tried it or just beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we chose this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we did focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done this in three different
locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're working in the Toronto
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been working with in Ohio and
Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've worked with two different grants
along with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers Canada, the USDA, the Department
of Ag in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had three days of focus groups where
we had those, we wanted to find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: the pipeline was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not the people we necessarily
think are going to be our customers right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at the 18 to 29 year olds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then looked at the 30 to 49 year olds,
which is our sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also looked at parents who had
children between the ages of two and 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's a whole different dynamic
all on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had three days of questions for
each of those groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted at least 20 participants in
each group, which means if you wanted them
[SPEAKER_00]: there by the third day, you started the
first day with a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on average, we had more than 100 people
on each year of study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are some of the things we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Ohio's key findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find out that the act of gardening has
mostly positive impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting positive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think of it as outdoors and beautiful
and healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do have that reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers have distinct ideas of who
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that lady right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't see themselves as that lady
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think she has to have tons of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's a very key part.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has to be expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has to know what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even people who like to garden think
they're stupid about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't feel expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's that limiting, then they're
not going to associate themselves with
[SPEAKER_00]: that hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the term gardening has a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden centers are the third most popular
place to buy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grocery stores and mass merchants are the
most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will drive by a independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting, the first time
we did a focus group was in Atlanta,
[SPEAKER_00]: where Home Depot is headquartered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were being told is that if you
go into a garden retail, somebody who's an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert in that, it's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to feel stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I go in there and they know more
than I do, and they know I know more than
[SPEAKER_00]: they know more than I do, then I feel
humiliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this sense of being caught being
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody wants to feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would rather go to Home Depot
where they know the employees might or
[SPEAKER_00]: might not know, but at least they're not
stupid in comparison to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's something we have to
overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consumers lack, this one was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fourth finding, we had the three days
of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of questions we're asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't ask one question in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This became a key finding because we heard
the word luck and risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked over and over and over again from
all three groups and related to all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different questions over three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one person said, I knew I shouldn't buy
that rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I was going to kill it,
but I bought it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so lucky it survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this sense that if you buy a
plant, you have no impact on if it
[SPEAKER_00]: succeeds, if it lives or dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think of gardening like someone going
to cook and don't have a recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided to throw everything into
a pot and hope it comes out tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sense that we don't need
recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sense we have no control over
how it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a major problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why gardening is not the number one
hobby anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we learned last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this past year, it's uncomfortable
feeling ignorant, which is two different
[SPEAKER_00]: groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two totally different,
one's in Ohio, one's in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also had the ones in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard this again and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's incredibly insightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's saying this for those of you who
didn't hear, he wonders if three and four,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that right, or two and three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two and three are interrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a distinct idea who gardens,
and then garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is very much that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had several people tell me in Atlanta,
because those were the ones I actually sat
[SPEAKER_00]: in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones, we made sure we weren't in
the room other than to moderate questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to make sure it's as
unintimidating a process as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I heard several people say that I will
go to a garden center once I'm an expert,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not an expert yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to follow up a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everybody familiar with the Brandeis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Brandeis, isn't it,
that does the incoming freshmen,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of their world perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll say they've never been in a
world where, I don't know what the most
[SPEAKER_00]: recent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they've always had smartphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what a CD is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never even heard of a VCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of go through to try to give the
professors a sense of the kind of world
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think about that when it comes to
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandparents were major gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough that my mom loved to
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people do not have parents who
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at least two generations away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm 50, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm on that cusp of between these two
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get younger and younger
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the whole disconnect
[SPEAKER_00]: of what gardening is and that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another problem, which I'm about
to get to in a moment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants to feel ignorant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they feel ignorant, there's a sense
that they're not going to even try,
[SPEAKER_00]: which leads to online research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone at dinner last night was talking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying that people will come
into the garden center saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to look it up online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tried to research things
online?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm someone who, I'm a new homeowner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a house for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the element in my oven caught on fire,
shorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, the usual ways of putting
out a fire doesn't work other than just
[SPEAKER_00]: turning off the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went online to find out because I'm
cheap and I want to do an addition a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to have a new kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to buy a new oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went online and I saw a video on how
to replace the element.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what people do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to do that with gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more out there than there used to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of information and
disinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they'll do, they'll start online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they want a trusted real person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be their aunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they do know someone in the family who
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll call them up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'll go into a garden center now and
start asking questions.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, online research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online research is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they start.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they kind of get so far,
then they want to talk to someone who they
[SPEAKER_00]: think might know what they're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we have a real
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And food gardening is almost as common as
flower gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ian Baldwin is a consultant in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been working with the National
Gardening Association with their national
[SPEAKER_00]: survey they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it since, I think,
1970.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look at food gardening not just
for the vegetable plants and the herbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we know are not very high ticket or
high margin products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at everything else that people
buy when they do that type of gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to have, as you mentioned,
you have people who want to do vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens in containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying all of that garden
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buying the pots, which are usually
big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a tomato, you can't
have a little pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying gloves and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This generation wants to look the part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to get their boots and
their clogs and they're going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: hats and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be well equipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more associated with vegetable
gardening than it is with flower
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it hasn't completely overtaken it,
but it's neck and neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't underestimate that category for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about when we have dinner parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do people gather now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kitchen Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to be out in the dining room or
if you had them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have big, big parties,
how often are they held in the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost always held inside now
because we don't want mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if the conditions are absolutely
perfect and you had time to mow the grass
[SPEAKER_00]: and do the weeding and all that,
do you see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about all the... Think about how
popular on HGTV all the home decor stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is because people are inside all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking and going,
you know, I'm kind of tired of the... I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I need to restain that wall because
you're looking at it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you begin thinking, I don't like that
blonde wood anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to look a little... I want to
get a little pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You begin... That's just human nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to begin tweaking stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not outside, you're not thinking
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the only time you're going outside is
to snow blow or you're going out to rake
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're going out to mow the lawn,
it's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're only going outside to get in
your car, we've got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to be outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're going to hiking trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to outdoor, you know,
their kids sporting events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors to people now are not their
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to figure out in our
marketing, you know, nature is at your
[SPEAKER_00]: doorstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need to emphasize that nature
is right there because if people are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going outside, all they're doing are
chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, has anyone ever done any home
renovations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how freaking hard that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my best friend and I decided that
she had this cute bungalow and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided that they had a big attic and
they're going to add a bedroom up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took out the hall closet and I know
it's all the rage now, but should laugh if
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever try to actually pull that sucker
stuff, that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much fun for like the first 15
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had about four more days to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but people are still focused on the
end result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening is nowhere near as hard as home
decor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're so focused on the annoying part,
you know, they're not looking at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: result because they're not outside
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I like so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who absolutely hated gardening,
who had no desire, was never going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% every single person said children
should be gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get unplugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to get away from all their
computers and their games.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to understand where food comes
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks kids should be gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, except the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I think is a big vehicle to get
people back into the garden retail in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about what this desire to
get unplugged and get out of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: routine, because gardening is not as
routine as say going to a sporting event
[SPEAKER_00]: and ballet and everything is so,
so structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people aren't quite ready to give that
up because they still want them to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into Cornell and Harvard and that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do want them to have a little bit
more instructor time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really think about the marketing that
you can be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I wrote an article a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would not make sense at all
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was less than five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was, do we really want to
have kids in the garden center?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of retailers don't want kids
coming to the garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they do is they force the parents to
be there for less than 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their attention span is so short.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mess things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They climb on the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their parents never spend that much
anyway, which actually I'll show you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, but they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't bring the kids,
you're not going to have cells pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where you get the adults in,
because everybody thinks kids need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a cover story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's saying there's a garden center near
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has a scavenger hunt for kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to go through the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they find their tomato plant or
whatever it is, the prize that they get,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get a gold star when they leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about that mindset and think
about what they would think walking into
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a perception problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in and it's a horizontal sea of
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know even the difference between
the annual and the perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm walking into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually pretty well done,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I am someone who doesn't know where
to get started, yikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing on time, by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm kind of... OK, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a solution to all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not someone just to say, scared,
scared, scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to figure out what
we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my philosophy for my career is if I
focus on who is reading, who is the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, we can't go too far wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might make a misstep here or there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we get so stuck on ourselves
thinking we know everything, we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to not... Our numbers of people who are
reading articles, we're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: plummet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to crash and burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact same thing is true for anyone
who deals with the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including garden centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be thinking about who your
customer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the things we've done,
one of the reasons we've been so specific
[SPEAKER_00]: about the locations is you have to
understand the customer in that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't the same in Toronto as they
are in Atlanta, Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some universal truths about
human nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your community is your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we worked with...
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Susan Hogan.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the professor from the MBA
college, Goizetta School of Business,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called, at Emory University
in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worked with a garden center in
Massachusetts called Lakeview Nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody familiar with Lakeview?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a couple of locations in the
Lunenberg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a fun bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did this in May of 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: April and May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided we're going to research her
customers specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who are actually coming into the
garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at customers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's going, oh, I already know my
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm reading all the new reports that
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is a very smart woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can see Michelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle's the second from the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some way to do a pointer
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to play with this other than
the forward and backward now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Michelle right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle Hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she owns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's her husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her family owned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's her husband who's a finance guy
on this team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know his name is
Richard Bursch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a skeptic on all of the stuff we're
doing beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was sure she understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she's someone who really pays
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does a lot of really smart things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we said, let's just take a look at who
your customers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going in, she knew who her customer
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a 50 to 60 something female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was affluent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she loved gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to do three different types
of research methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in here are researchers?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to be going over stuff
you've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the observational, which I call
the Jane Goodall, or more honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: stalking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lattering, which is answering questions
and asking basically like a three-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why, why, why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until you're getting to the emotional
payoff of what caused something fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it jumps forward, it jumps forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to watching what they're doing,
then hyper individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went to as broad as we could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did three different methods to try
to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The observational method.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to recruit people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what they're doing is they
are watching people shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to find the right person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule number one, never have it be a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, and this is stereotyping,
but women, most of us were raised to
[SPEAKER_00]: always be aware of who's around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And males are threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless he's a really cute guy,
but you're noticing him too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, if you don't know a
guy, and you know if someone just happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to be going from department to department
with you, you're always aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm generalizing, but does anyone,
any female in here think differently on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I mean it's true enough that
enough women are doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we are aware, I don't know about you,
I was always taught to look in the back
[SPEAKER_00]: seat before I get in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that first episode of Dexter when he
strangled the guy in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, coming out of the back seat,
it's like yeah, that never would have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with a woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we always look in the back seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always aware of the fact that we
could be easy victims, because we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: as physically strong as men.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not, I'm not saying we're
always victims, but we're always alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never want to have a male do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they ended up doing is they
recruited two ladies who head up their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden clubs in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shop at multiple stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did not want them to be employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another big important rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your employees are recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going to, they're going to
be interrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be, they're going to be
noticed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got two older ladies who shop at
multiple stores who are going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to say how incredible
you are, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they worked separately and they
followed people all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days on Saturday and Sunday,
two weekends in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to, they selected the criteria
of what they're going to observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had bought new, they're on a hilly
location, so they had bought handbrakes on
[SPEAKER_00]: their carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to see, you know,
basically, I'm sure they're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, look how much more money we're
getting because of these great carts we
[SPEAKER_00]: have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not having to go down to the liquor
store at the bottom of the hill to get our
[SPEAKER_00]: carts back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also wanted to see where in the
store they went, how many people they
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to, what, you know, which
departments they went to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pick things up and put them back
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they end up buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they do, you know, did they have
impulse buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also looking at general,
they can guesstimate their age.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could, you know, if they're by
themselves or they're with kids or a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend or a spouse, you know, they're
making those type of observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long they were in the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it for multiple days of
observation and they compiled the chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: the results in a chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, chart sample, time in store,
we've kind of gone the age and gender,
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took notes, like they had room if
there's something unusual, they can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: note about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's an example of what we learned
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have this person, number one,
is they're in the store 35 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're about in 30s, there's a female
with one child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primary path, they really wanted to see
where they went, so we have the path
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: She spoke with staff, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was purchased?
[SPEAKER_00]: Window boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kid project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hummingbird feeder and perennials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add-ons at checkout, she got that
Hummingbird feeder right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seemed to pick up an item from
every department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staff worked with her to find plants and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they did this with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found out, oops,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what they found out, when they
compiled all of this, their main customer
[SPEAKER_00]: was a 30-something couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in a store about 20 minutes on
average, you know, she was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: above average in her time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she actually spoke with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, they didn't speak to
people in their departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were there quickly because they had
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there, like I said, that 20-minute
timeframe, but they piled a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: in that short time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next most important group was
that 50-something female, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: there on average 45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spoke with people in each
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a big difference in how you're
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the next one, and we're short on time,
I would normally bring someone up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, let's do a practical practice of
laddering, but this is kind of a why,
[SPEAKER_00]: why, why method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you can have about half hour of the
customer, what you do is you ask them,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the last thing you purchased?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's the last thing you purchased at
a garden center?
[SPEAKER_05]: A perennial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did you buy that perennial?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, why is it important to you to have
something that appeals to you that's
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you caught that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was told that this is not zone six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I should sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she goes, now I need to have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It died.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, you keep pushing and
pushing and pushing until you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the emotional payoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for one woman that this method was
done, they found out that she actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't like gardening, but she wants her
daughter to come over and spend time with
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, her daughter will come over to
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the tasks her daughter
volunteers is happy to do with her because
[SPEAKER_00]: mom needs help in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, she doesn't really like gardening,
but it's a way to spend time with her
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emotional payoff has nothing to do
with gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with family and emotional
fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else, and this is where it gets
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you're interviewing all these
individuals and then you go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one and you kind of compare notes
about the different groups, the
[SPEAKER_00]: 30-something is I'm the kind of person who
really cares about the planet and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be an organic gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the kind of person who cares about
what happens to the food that goes in my
[SPEAKER_00]: family's body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want to make sure it's pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all control over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the kind of person to see the,
you know, let's continue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that was about a form of
self-expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extremely different than somewhat
like the older group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more about a chance to be alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger group was about socializing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older group was about recharging and
getting away from the madness of their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two extremely different
marketing messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you really need to understand the
demographics of who's buying the plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area, in your store.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten minutes, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I was saying, if you notice
patterns in the observational study,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can cross-match it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also did the survey method,
and frankly, this was almost just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we asked, what do you want from a
garden center?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a whole bunch of things they
could choose from, and then they asked
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, how do we do each of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that went to several thousand people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you could see, you know, we're looking
at different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, here's some of the questions we asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's important to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, how are we doing on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it changed from group to group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we got the demographic
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it was important to have, when it
comes to independent, this is true across
[SPEAKER_00]: the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people who cared about knowledge,
who cared about quality, they always went
[SPEAKER_00]: to a locally-owned plant retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's going to be the grocery
store or a mass merchant, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: never there just to buy plants,
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to buy other things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say, someone as busy as I am,
that's a big appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, being active in the community,
kid-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see where that, all these
different things would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety of plants was important,
but it's not as important as we as
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are plant people,
not business people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we put, you know, the plant is most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our biggest, you know, everybody
knows, it's our biggest seller,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at all plants as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we need to increase the sales of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they're there at your
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tend to put much more, you know,
we will give you six ways to kill a slug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you 20,000 rows to varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumer wants us to actually do
some editing for them on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's not part of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me editorializing,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what Lakeview learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: This primary customer family with the
parents in their 30s or 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: The expensive cars were a bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michelle kept the dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read through all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, because you had, it was,
you know, like with the lawnmower where
[SPEAKER_00]: you had the double handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for it to go, you have to squeeze
it together and to stop it, you let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same kind of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: People couldn't figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dragging, especially the guys,
were dragging it through the gravel with
[SPEAKER_00]: the brakes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they had a fire cell pretty quickly
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were $500 a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had to just admit that they made a
mistake with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customers were ditching the racetrack
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who doesn't know what a
racetrack path is, it's whenever you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you go through Ikea, they have a
racetrack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take you through the entire store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of have to know the inside
ways to kind of cut corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same concept with a garden
center where you take, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a wider path than anything else in
the garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes you all the way through all
the plant yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout the entire store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they have one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the further they go into the
store, the more they're going to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they were finding that there's one
location where everybody was leaving on
[SPEAKER_00]: the first weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the next weekend, in between the two
weekends, they increased the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: display there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they didn't block it if they actually
wanted to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't so visually appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't this wider path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they made it so they can go in that
section easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't so obvious a path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody started going to the back of
the store after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is just a good practice overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these are things beyond just,
you know, this is just behavior of the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also found out that what motivates
the two main customer groups are very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sales training needed tweaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a product that they're not
making money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a $5 starter kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every shrub sold, they want their
staff to sell this $5 starter kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in there is value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is no margin on that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do that because just by the
customer reading the instructions,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in the fertilizer, they're
watering the plant more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the fact that they're, you know,
taking care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not just putting it in the ground
and walking away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing more discouraging than
someone had the first plant they buy,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially they spend money on it like a
shrub, than for it to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, they found out there's their staff
wasn't doing that, weren't really selling
[SPEAKER_00]: that starter kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they had an emergency staff meeting
where they did role playing and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that to train their staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their sales on that starter kit went
up 65%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the sales of the starter kit
itself monetarily aren't that important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is because then the customer has
more success and they're happy and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come back to the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have been brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she's saying is that it probably
would have been smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't quite say it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it probably would have been smarter to
add the cost of the starter kit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: shrubs so they get it as a gift of
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want you to succeed so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our gift to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure their costs are covered
because they're not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a money-making venture for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you actually add the price right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study I'm working on right now is
pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are terrible about including all
our costs when we price a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: both growers and retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're terrible at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freight is a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a bad thing to include it in
the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not cheating your customer because
you're wanting to include freight in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell a lot of people do not do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm probably going to, because we're
probably towards the end here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell I'm not wearing a watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was like looking at your own,
own store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is how do we get bigger,
you know, more people to come into your
[SPEAKER_00]: store?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to get comfortable with
spending time with the census.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the census will have information,
demographic information about the zip
[SPEAKER_00]: codes in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get really granular with
what the information the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: government has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can target communities that you
know you want to be attracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can send all of your
mailers to that zip code and that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot you can learn from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hold focus groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, buy $100 gift cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put an ad on Craigslist to get people
to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And begin questioning them about,
you know, you could choose what area that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that you want to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're wanting to do projects that you
want to have displays related to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the projects they're trying to,
they want to do at their home.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they trying to improve?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Create an advisory panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that to the beginning of my
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, you know, if I have something come
up, I have a group of people who've agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: to let me bug them on the phone and say,
hey, I've got this topic I think we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle, but I'm not doing what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the same thing with customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get a group that you know will
be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to pick the people,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want people who are opinionated,
but not people who are obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are so opinionated that they can't see
that other people have different points of
[SPEAKER_00]: view.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, you know, you want someone
who's going to be honest and just shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: from the hip and tell you what you need to
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get some really good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say bring them together at
least once a month to kind of get some
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a focus group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something formal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is you, you know, being willing to
hear people who are willing to help you
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an HOA, Offer to Work Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: HOAs have an amazing amount of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is homeowners associations for those
who don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have rules like, oh, if you let
the grass go brown, you get fined every
[SPEAKER_00]: day it's brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm from Texas, so, you know,
there's actually people out there spray
[SPEAKER_00]: painting their lawn to get brown that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have more than three rose
bushes in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's a lot of people,
people who get on HOA boards, and if
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody in here is on one, I'm about to
insult you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who get on HOA boards are
people who are not accustomed to having
[SPEAKER_00]: power in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of go a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in college, I worked with the
Student Loan Association in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why they did this,
but they asked me to organize the annual
[SPEAKER_00]: Home and Loan, what do you call it,
the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a college student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the heck I'm doing,
but I'm lining up the speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're giving me the speakers,
but I'm calling them and inviting them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm doing the site visits,
and I mean, this is way more power than I
[SPEAKER_00]: should have been given, but I was also
moonlighting at night at Dillett's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so one day, I had to speak to the
Secretary of Education for the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get him on the phone, well, Mr. Secretary,
oh no, no, call me Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to work that night, and it's this
little guy who's the manager of the store,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like maybe five years older than
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Mr. Monroe, you must call me Monroe,
Mr. Monroe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with not much power have more
desire to force other people to show them
[SPEAKER_00]: respect, and people with real power need
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: HOA, sometimes you get that mindset on
those boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every yard in this should never,
ever, ever, ever have a pink flamingo,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you have one, I'm finding you
$1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can only have blue and green
as the front door colors, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can only have wrought iron for
your fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some silly stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens with plants, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have any vegetable plants in
your yard at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tacky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you actually work with a
homeowners' association, I've known a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple retailers who've done this,
they'll have open nights at their garden
[SPEAKER_00]: center where 10% of all sales,
and that's a big, not just profit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but 10% of sales go back to the
homeowners' association.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love getting money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you work with them, and then you can
say, hey, here are some things you should
[SPEAKER_00]: know about sustainability, and this is
what, you know, can really help your
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing politics, really, is what it is,
but it can make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how I was talking about
factfinder.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go spend some time and explore your
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you need to find out what the
ethnic groups are in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're far too white in industry,
and we attract far too many white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a much more diverse country than
that, and we need to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, that focus groups, advisors,
all of that, be respectful, try to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know, how gardening is different
for some, you know, if you have a large
[SPEAKER_00]: community, that has immigrated from
Estonia, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way America is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have enclaves from countries sometimes
we never heard of until we find out that's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be reaching out to these
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: America's only getting more diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend time here, and that's gonna help you
get to know your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good news is we're an industry made
up of independently owned businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that means we are more flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're better able to understand who our
communities are, and if we really focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: who they are, all of those problems I was
talking about in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all, there's no one answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one answer, but if you're
focusing so much on who your customer is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be responding to them,
and you're gonna be automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to them because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
you
