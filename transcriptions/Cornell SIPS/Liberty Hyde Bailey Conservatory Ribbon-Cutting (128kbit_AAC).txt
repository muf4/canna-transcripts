[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so welcome to the grand opening of
the reborn Liberty Hyde-Bailey
[SPEAKER_02]: Conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Alan Culver, the director of the
School of Integrative Plant Science,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have the honor of leading the thanks
to those who developed this wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: resource for our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will begin by thanking the Capital
Program's managers and directors,
[SPEAKER_02]: who unfortunately could not be here,
they are John Gurney, director,
[SPEAKER_02]: State University Capital Program
Management, Scott Lewis, regional director
[SPEAKER_02]: of Capital Program Management,
and Bill Penick, Capital Program Manager
[SPEAKER_02]: for Cornell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should note that Glenn Evans in a second
will introduce or acknowledge some other
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are involved more locally with
the development of the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank the Liberty
Hyde-Bailey Garden Club, and its
[SPEAKER_02]: president, Ed Cobb,
[SPEAKER_02]: for donating the wonderful plaque that
gives special meaning to the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: A unifying theme of the school is
discovery that connects, and the new
[SPEAKER_02]: conservatory provides a nexus for many
connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, its state of the art design
connects us with a future of energy
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiency and closer connections between
plant growth and engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conservatory, along with many other
important resources maintained by the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell University Agricultural Experiment
Station, will be described by Glenn Evans,
[SPEAKER_02]: the director of operations for the
Experiment Station, who will also
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge the staff who make everything
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: A second speaker will address the
conservatory's collection connections that
[SPEAKER_02]: connect us with the world of plant
diversity and enable us, even in the gray
[SPEAKER_02]: cold of I think a February or May day,
enable us to stand in tropical warmth and
[SPEAKER_02]: see the sweep of plant evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at an amazing plant and then hold
up a mobile device and learn the life
[SPEAKER_02]: story of that plant, which is a cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Kevin Nixon, who is the chair of
the conservatory committee, and also a
[SPEAKER_02]: professor in the Hortorium, the Liberty
Hyde-Bailey Hortorium, will next speak
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conservatory connections with history,
which begin with Liberty Hyde-Bailey,
[SPEAKER_02]: the visionary plant scientist who
established it as its first dean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ed Cobb, who is chair of the SIPP's
History and Archive Committee,
[SPEAKER_02]: will address the conservatory's history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, the conservatory provides a
starting point for visitors to explore
[SPEAKER_02]: plant science destinations across campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these include the student-designed
Urban Eden plantings right here next to us
[SPEAKER_02]: and elsewhere on campus, led by Nina
Bessick's class, soil monolith collections
[SPEAKER_02]: in Bradfield Hall, a soon-to-come
paleobotany fossil display in plant
[SPEAKER_02]: science, as well as the Cornell
Plantations and many other sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I invite you to explore this on your
own, which you can do with the aid of this
[SPEAKER_02]: guide, which is available inside,
and with your mobile device, which you can
[SPEAKER_02]: use to open up maps and all sorts of other
resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that, I want to thank Magdalene
Lindbergh and Craig Kramer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also want to thank Tara Reed for
providing sound and refreshments and
[SPEAKER_02]: events planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would now like to turn it over to
Glenn Evans, the director of operations
[SPEAKER_02]: for the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I just want to acknowledge a few
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inevitably, I'll miss a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to acknowledge as many as I can
who have really been instrumental across
[SPEAKER_01]: the experiment station with really making
this structure a reality and also
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving the integrity of these 500-plus
species that we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to see where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those of you who have been at
Cornell, while you have seen sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: process that it took to get to where we
are now and can probably appreciate it
[SPEAKER_01]: better than most just how many steps you
have to go through to get something like
[SPEAKER_01]: this into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's two areas I really want to
express thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first is with the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the interim, in the absence of a
conservatory, while this was being built
[SPEAKER_01]: and discussions were being held about the
future of the conservatory, all that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material had to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody who's ever had a
houseplant, had it die, well, times that
[SPEAKER_01]: by 500 or 1,000 or maybe a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the level of complexity
that our greenhouse growers and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: staff had to do to move the plant
material, to care for it, to manage the
[SPEAKER_01]: pests and diseases, and really keep it in
a fine shape so that when its new home is
[SPEAKER_01]: finally built, that everything looked
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really want to express thanks,
first of all, to our Tower Road greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some of those are here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Trey and Merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to express thanks to Paul Cooper in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Paul is the head greenhouse grower and
really throughout this process in managing
[SPEAKER_01]: this collection and maintaining it in the
fine shape that it's in, his expertise has
[SPEAKER_01]: been truly invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to express a sincere
thanks to Melissa Breckner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melissa is the supervisor for that range
and manages these folks as a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really takes a team of folks to manage
this plant material, to keep it going and
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving just as we like to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other area that's really been
important throughout this process has been
[SPEAKER_01]: in the structure itself and figuring out
all the bits and pieces so that they work
[SPEAKER_01]: together appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anybody who's ever had a home
repair, had a roof replaced or even new
[SPEAKER_01]: siding, you know how things don't always
go quite the way they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they end up costing just a tad more
than maybe they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this structure is no exception to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really takes someone with a keen eye
and attention to detail and really a team
[SPEAKER_01]: effort to go through the entire process of
designing it, putting it out to bid,
[SPEAKER_01]: having all of the contractors and folks on
the job put things in place so that
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitably it'll be a long-term structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be successful and really functional
and geared to the plant material and the
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we've been very successful
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very minor bugs left to work out
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few folks to thank, right here at
Cal's facilities up in Kennedy,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a really good team of facilities
folks, including Peter Paradise and Bill
[SPEAKER_01]: Dattel in our infrastructure properties
and planning, which is our central
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had really good project management
throughout the process from Kaz Hatsatori
[SPEAKER_01]: and Art Fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the guys who are really are
in and out of the project throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: build phase and really making sure those
bits and pieces come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last, but certainly not least,
I want to thank Andy Lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy Lead is our plant growth facilities
manager.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy is just an incredible knowledge base
throughout this process, really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: catching things in design that would
otherwise be a major issue now and really
[SPEAKER_01]: helping to evolve the design.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go through the structure,
please don't just look at the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really cool features there,
everything from energy-saving shade
[SPEAKER_01]: curtains, some high-efficiency
supplemental lights, appropriate shades
[SPEAKER_01]: and mist systems, a really sophisticated
environmental control system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these features that have to work
together so that the plant material is
[SPEAKER_01]: happy and so that inevitably we're happy
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd like to turn it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to say, again, thanks to all
those folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wouldn't mind giving them a round
of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're well-deserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin Nixon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: My involvement in this is basically as
manager and sort of curator of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I need to thank a whole bunch
of people first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most importantly would be Paul,
Paul Cooper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't have done anything in there
without Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he acts not only as an oracle to us,
but also just to bounce ideas off of in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of how to arrange the plants and all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Devin and Trey who helped to plant
this little forest we have in here and
[SPEAKER_02]: daily will take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Melissa, Andy, very important in this
whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Craig.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig hasn't been mentioned yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig has been deeply involved in this the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, Ed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this would be standing here
right now if it wasn't for Ed,
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, and the students who really put up a
fight to get the conservatory here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really a big community
effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my involvement goes way back with the
old conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is, we're kind of taking a new
approach here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're going to do is have a very
carefully managed collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old conservatory, they were probably
six or eight different faculty members who
[SPEAKER_02]: had some kind of involvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just kind of was an amorphous thing
that went in various directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am going to be the curator and I want
to take any kind of recommendations and
[SPEAKER_02]: advice from anybody who would like to see
things go into the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, I'm not going to try to
restrict what's in there, but I am going
[SPEAKER_02]: to try to augment and develop a collection
that has a very wide birth, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: of diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now we have 144 families in the
conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 347 genera of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to count the number of species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's somewhere around 600 or more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is we're numbering in the 800s
right now in terms of the accessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I'm going to be doing is
developing connections with other
[SPEAKER_02]: conservatories, particularly the New York
Botanical Garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already propagating new stuff for
us to bring in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're going to have an exciting
time here of adding things.
[SPEAKER_02]: My intent is to add stuff that's
educational, that fills, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's of interest to a variety of people
from people who are interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution, systematics, horticulture,
house plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Visitors can see things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they won't see elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that sense, you will start to see
some things disappear from the
[SPEAKER_02]: conservatory because there's no point in
us, you know, cultivating a begonia that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see every time you go to Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, the important thing
about the conservatory from my standpoint
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it is a biological collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I'm curator of the herbarium,
we already have a lot of experience in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of curating collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a big database structure in
the herbarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've kind of taken that idea and
we've developed databases and interfaces
[SPEAKER_02]: that will allow you to actually interface
information about this collection on your
[SPEAKER_02]: cell phones or tablets, or you can do it
from your computer in your office as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of you are probably familiar with QR
codes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to use a QR code, you need to
go either to the Apple Store or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Android Store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have a Windows phone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's one for Windows and then
maybe even Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Blackberry has one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but at any rate, you can get a free
app whereby you just take a picture
[SPEAKER_02]: basically through the app of this QR code,
which there's one on your pamphlet there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it will bring up the web page
that we've set up that accesses the
[SPEAKER_02]: database about that plant, that particular
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just developing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these aren't going to have a lot
of information yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for instance, if you do the QR code
for the carnivorous plants, it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: links you to a video showing a carnivorous
plant eating a little arthropod.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are various things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to add lots of links in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The information is thin on some of these
things, but it will be increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you go in from the other end and come
up the center aisle there on your right,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're just starting to put in an
evolutionary sequence for land plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes from liverworts to angiosperms along
that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still are missing some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some different lycopodes and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know that there's much else I'd
like to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I'd like to thank everybody
who's involved, and who has been involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: and who will be involved, and any students
who want to get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking for people who want
to work in the conservatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, which means I forgot to thank Nick and
Patty, who are the ones that you'll see in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that we have it set up now so
they can actually enter data through their
[SPEAKER_02]: cell phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a good reason they just hang
out now down here, entering data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for instance, there's a little app
they can enter data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time they go through,
they check, not every time, but often
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll check to see what's in flower,
and they can just hit a little button that
[SPEAKER_02]: says that's in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many things do you think are in
flower right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Daddy knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: 134.
[SPEAKER_02]: 134?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are 134 plants in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a few are in the Purple House,
but most of them are in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have flowers on them right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might look sometimes they're hard to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants don't have very attractive
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at any rate, I'm very happy to be here,
and I'm hoping that we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: really develop this into something great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our next and final speaker is Ed Cobb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to national meetings,
and I always wonder why the historians
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out these papers and actually read
their statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad you could come today for this nice
balmy weather in the springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's nice and warm in the greenhouse,
we'll be there soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been four conservatory
greenhouses built on the Cornell campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first conservatory was built in 1882
and was attached to the botany wing of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage College.
[SPEAKER_00]: A smaller conservatory was built near this
site in 1909.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was designed to house tropical plants
for the new College of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1931, another conservatory was built on
this exact site when the plant science
[SPEAKER_00]: building was constructed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction on the conservatory before us
today was completed in late 2015 during
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's successful centennial year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the two buildings that can be
locked in for 2015, us and Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Liberty High Bailey, the first dean of
the still very active College of
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture, was involved in selecting the
curved glass design of the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: conservatory constructed by Lord Burnham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting in the 1920s, Bailey traveled
extensively collecting and studying palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the very first plants that were
moved into the new conservatory in 1931
[SPEAKER_00]: were palms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even have a glass slide that proves
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows the plants in the previous
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants were moved in at the new
conservatory in 1931.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palms, as we know, require special
conditions, especially for survival in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca's hospital winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research on palm anatomy and palm taxonomy
continues in this structure for over 75
[SPEAKER_00]: years with plants being maintained in this
conservatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, this is a grand day for Cornell and
the plant sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many people to thank for this
state of art structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: After over 75 years of continuous use,
plans were drawn up for renovation or
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuilding of the previous Liberty High
Bailey Conservatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the fall of 2010, it was
announced that it was to be torn down and
[SPEAKER_00]: not replaced, particularly on this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: This resulted in a grassroots movement
within the Cornell community to save the
[SPEAKER_00]: conservatory in this location for easy
access by students and the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heather Hawley, president of Board of
Forum at the time, circulated a petition
[SPEAKER_00]: to restore the conservatory or have it
rebuilt in this location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within less than a week, over 800 members
of the Cornell community signed the
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, Carol Bader,
a long-time caretaker of the conservatory,
[SPEAKER_00]: brought the plight of the structure to the
attention of President David Scorton,
[SPEAKER_00]: who eventually influenced the decision and
saved our conservatory at this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my hope and the hope of everyone
here today that proper care, this
[SPEAKER_00]: conservatory, and the collection of plants
contained within will survive into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next century for the benefit and pleasure
of generations to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Kevin and Ed and Lam can come help me,
we can do this by ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can open this up and enable you all to
get in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: One,
[SPEAKER_02]: two, three.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
