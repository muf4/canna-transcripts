[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll excuse me, I'm still a little numb
from my walk across campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I park quite far from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just gotten off a four hour road
trip to arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to Martina and Halle for
inviting me and to our horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues for donating the slot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martina mentioned about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been at this for over 40
years in different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out as a US Peace Corps
volunteer working around water and
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture irrigation issues in the very
early 1980s in East Africa, Kenya,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that time I was working with small
farmers in a variety of different settings
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with a challenging environment at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was very serious drought,
extended prolonged drought leading to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of famine, a lot of insecurity,
issues around water scarcity that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with then, which intrigued me
enough to want to go back and do my PhD in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same reason on farmer managed
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost did the PhD here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I didn't is because the
people I wanted to work with were going on
[SPEAKER_01]: extended sabbaticals and weren't going to
be available for me for about a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly even longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure it was my loss in many
respects not to come to Cornell to study
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was certainly inspired in my own
research at that time from the work that
[SPEAKER_01]: was being done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it continued to be so over many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a few years later that I was
doing my PhD research in the same region
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at farmer managed irrigation
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was part of a program that was
managed by the World Resources Institute
[SPEAKER_01]: in Washington called From the Ground Up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was looking at community-based
natural resource management and a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: set of different practices of local
innovation around NRM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a service survey instrument
that we were implementing in a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different communities that was extremely
long, very laborious for the researchers
[SPEAKER_01]: to carry out and to analyze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it was rather a boring and
difficult process for the local people who
[SPEAKER_01]: were responding to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Partway through the process of doing that,
we had a visit from two colleagues from
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK, a gentleman named Robert Chambers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other Gordon Conway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first was someone who'd worked for
many years around rural development policy
[SPEAKER_01]: and practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other around agroecosystems analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were dear friends and collaborators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were early pioneers in what was
called rapid rural appraisal and
[SPEAKER_01]: agroecosystem analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they came to a room like this in
Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happened to attend with several
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they introduced those approaches,
those tools and methods in that and talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about survey slavery, the overuse of
surveys in social science research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the need to really think differently
about how we engage with local people in
[SPEAKER_01]: our research processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were grappling with many of the
same questions that they were engaging
[SPEAKER_01]: with in places like Thailand and India,
Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody had really encountered some of
these ideas at that point and had them
[SPEAKER_01]: presented in such clear and concise ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got us very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, let's try it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually scrapped some of the
survey work we were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started testing these ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the late 80s, 87, 88.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we developed and adapted the approach
to call it participatory rural appraisal,
[SPEAKER_01]: PRA.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time, Robert invited me to
come to IDS still as a graduate student to
[SPEAKER_01]: present some of those results and some of
our initial thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, there was a set of
discussions going on about how do we put
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers first in the agricultural research
and development process to put the more
[SPEAKER_01]: center stage in this as active partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to take you through is the
history of that from the point of view of
[SPEAKER_01]: three books and some inspiring insights
and ideas that Martina and Hale have
[SPEAKER_01]: instigated a further thinking about how we
can take some of these ideas forward by
[SPEAKER_01]: looking back at what we've learned and
what we've achieved, but also what we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't and where we might go in future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to provide an overview of
three farmer first books covering a period
[SPEAKER_01]: of about 20 years describing how we were
engaging in different debates over that
[SPEAKER_01]: period around these ideas of farmer
participatory research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll go through and compare and
contrast some of the different views and
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches to putting farmers first,
how those have evolved in that period,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then take stock of some of the current
political, economic, institutional context
[SPEAKER_01]: in which agricultural research and
development is taking place today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then talk a little bit about the project
that Hale and Martina and I with some
[SPEAKER_01]: other colleagues are embarking on now try
to examine some of these participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: research and extension ideas in national
systems in different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be happy to take questions after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, there were three books
produced over a period that covered from
[SPEAKER_01]: the late 80s to the end of the noughties,
and it was essentially 20 years where we
[SPEAKER_01]: were engaging across the world,
really, both north and south with partners
[SPEAKER_01]: in many different contexts, those working
within the consultative group on
[SPEAKER_01]: international agricultural research,
the national systems, but also a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: NGOs, university colleagues, people in
many, many different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first Farmer First, second what we
called Beyond Farmer First, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmer First Revisited.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three of them together, as Martina
mentioned, kind of elaborated the
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophical underpinnings, some of the
methodological dimensions of what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Farmer First approach or
paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were linked to three international
workshops that were hosted at IDS at
[SPEAKER_01]: different points and brought together over
100 scholars, practitioners from different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first was Farmer First on farmer
innovation and agricultural research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned my colleague Robert Chambers
now in his 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of about a month ago, he said,
I'm no longer responding to email,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he actually produced a book last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been quite prolific in his working
life and has been, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly influential in the area of rural
development, research, and planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he worked with a couple of other
colleagues, Arno Pacey, Lorianne Thrupp,
[SPEAKER_01]: who together edited all the proceedings
from the first Farmer First conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, the focus was on challenging
this notion of a linear view of transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: of technology from the scientists as
experts to the farmers as beneficiaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: as clients, as recipients of their
knowledge, wisdom, insights, and
[SPEAKER_01]: innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the argument was we've got to move
away from that top-down science-led
[SPEAKER_01]: approach, think much more about what we're
missing from all the local knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: practice and innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we bring that together in a more
meaningful way to respect those
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledges, those practices, those
experiences of those rural producers who,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, live in those places and know
their context better than anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the key areas, and this is an area
that I've focused much of my working
[SPEAKER_01]: career on, partly inspired by Robert's and
the Farmer First work, is what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: broadly the complex, diverse, risk-prone
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The arid, semi-arid lands, the places,
the sloping lands that are much harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage, where you have a lot of challenges
with soil, water, nutrient management,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have problems with productivity
because of low fertility, where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: problems of getting access to markets,
access to advisory services because of
[SPEAKER_01]: their remoteness in many cases,
but where a lot of poor people live and
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to rely on agriculture for their
livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue to work in tropical dry lands
around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were asking for, can we have a much
more adaptive, integrated approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural research and extension in
those places?
[SPEAKER_01]: That focus on putting farmers first became
that central lesson, that central focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was picked up some of these insights
from this book and others like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was parallel work going on with
colleagues in other parts of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Asia, in places like the Philippines,
in India, very innovative work in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Netherlands and Germany and
elsewhere on things like participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: technology development, it was called,
and participatory farmer innovation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole set of different approaches that
were all very complimentary, drawing on
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the same principles, even if they
were using somewhat different methods and
[SPEAKER_01]: tools in the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this whole proliferation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably the most exciting time of
my career and very honestly the most
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausting because we didn't stop for a
period of about five or six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this explosion of work that was
going on around farmer-led breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: participatory crop trials, participatory
soil and water conservation, participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: watershed management, integrated pest
management, integrated nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things were bubbling up in
different quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were experimenting everywhere but
always with this notion that farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: active partners in that research and
development process, that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: central to innovation in those settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking a period of the 1990s now and
that's when a lot of excitement in
[SPEAKER_01]: creating work was happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the things that Farmer First
was stressing was that this is not an
[SPEAKER_01]: argument against agricultural science or
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need those university researchers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need those people in the international
agricultural research system but we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to think differently about the
relationship between science and farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about is reversing some
of those power relations and changing some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those hierarchies that were quite
evident in earlier periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not involved in that first book but
I was on the wave and was working with
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert, working with many of the other
colleagues who had convened that first
[SPEAKER_01]: conference in a variety of settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my colleague Ian Schoones,
we were both then at the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute for Environment and Development,
IID in London.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were involved in this work but we also
saw that there were some concerns about
[SPEAKER_01]: power and politics, the political economy
of agricultural research and extension
[SPEAKER_01]: that we didn't feel were really being
addressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes back to some of those reversing
of hierarchies that just because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting some of these participatory
approaches, it doesn't mean that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing a real change in the principles and
in the attitudes and behaviour or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional structures of agencies,
universities and others still being very
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically oriented, very top-down,
very hierarchical and we needed to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about how we changed some of that to
really make this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our point is if we're going to do that,
we've got to get the grips with the
[SPEAKER_01]: politics of knowledge in these different
settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were asking questions about whose
knowledge counts, how is knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: constructed in these encounters between
farmers, researchers and extensionists in
[SPEAKER_01]: different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book was an attempt to extend the work
of Farmer First but it was also a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge to many of the proponents of the
Farmer First thinking because we viewed
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the participatory work as somewhat
naïve that just because people were using
[SPEAKER_01]: these new methods and tools in a variety
of settings that we were going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: those reversals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were saying no, it's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are structural constraints that are
very real that need to be addressed and
[SPEAKER_01]: these are fundamental if we're really
going to see those flips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a challenge to our participatory
proponents as well as more mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: The central themes were drawn from the
sociology of knowledge, anthropological,
[SPEAKER_01]: political, ecological insights into
notions about agricultural knowledge and
[SPEAKER_01]: practice and the argument was for a more
nuanced, more sophisticated stance in
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding these relationships and also
the arrangements, the institutional and
[SPEAKER_01]: policy arrangements around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we said this required understanding
rural knowledges on their own terms,
[SPEAKER_01]: not something that people were always so
comfortable with and seeking dialogue
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than simply trying to document what
farmers are already doing in their
[SPEAKER_01]: everyday practices and notions of
indigenous technical knowledge were very
[SPEAKER_01]: ITK, rural people's knowledge,
very widely being discussed and described
[SPEAKER_01]: then but still ultimately a very
externally driven technocratic project
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were observing even if it was
dressed up in that language of
[SPEAKER_01]: participatory research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years later Ian and I moved on from
IID.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still work with our colleagues there in
London but for a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We moved to the south coast of England to
Brighton where at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Sussex, the Institute of Development
Studies is based.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went some years before me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed, as Martina said, 2006 and when
I arrived, I said to Ian, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking back at 20 years nearly of
all this work on farmer participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't it be interesting to take stock,
to look at what's happened over this
[SPEAKER_01]: period, what worked and what didn't and
why and so we, Robert also was still there
[SPEAKER_01]: with us although in a more of an emeritus
role then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we organized a conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Martina mentioned the Future Agriculture's
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a partnership with colleagues in
about a dozen Sub-Saharan African
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with on the political
economy of agricultural policy in Africa
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last 20 years and our ESRC STEP
Center which stands for Social
[SPEAKER_01]: Technological and Environmental Pathways
to Sustainability and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at pathways to transformative
sustainability processes not just in food
[SPEAKER_01]: and agriculture but in a variety of
domains as we call them, health and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease, energy and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used resources and our networks
from STEPS and Future Agriculture's to
[SPEAKER_01]: convene the third event and at that time
things had moved on in the debate to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more on innovation systems in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The World Bank had been picking up on
these notions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the development agencies had done
so and it was de-centering in some ways
[SPEAKER_01]: the role of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taking this systems perspective to
understand all these linkages,
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships, the flow of products,
knowledge, resources in different forms
[SPEAKER_01]: through that agricultural system and that
included research, insights and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is now the late 2000s when this
was all going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used it as an opportunity to revisit
some of those older debates about farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: participatory research but also explore
that wider context of ag innovation both
[SPEAKER_01]: from a systems perspective and as I say
from that political economy perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: the more critical of social science angle
to interrogate some of the thinking of
[SPEAKER_01]: that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we not only were examining some of the
state led R&D efforts but these wider
[SPEAKER_01]: networks because the other thing that had
evolved was not just the role of the state
[SPEAKER_01]: in providing agricultural extension,
research support in different quarters but
[SPEAKER_01]: also private sector actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a huge proliferation then of
that and lots of talk about public private
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships including in the agricultural
sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we wanted to examine that as part
of that discussion as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the focus was on the politics of
innovation and the way the farmers were
[SPEAKER_01]: included or as we saw often excluded from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said they'd been de-centered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're no longer that focal point because
the interest was less about what was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening on the farm but beyond the farm
gate and looking at value chains and
[SPEAKER_01]: networks and all these other linkages and
all these other actors which is fine but
[SPEAKER_01]: what about the role of the producers
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to leave these slides with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Martina and you've already
shared these but please feel free to do
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go through all of this in
detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just try to touch on some highlights
because this is a couple of extended table
[SPEAKER_01]: that was initially generated at the end of
our work in farmer first revisited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an attempt to describe some of
those different eras from the 60s through
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s and 80s 90s and upbringing it up
to the present at that time in the late
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to focus on the first one we were
looking at the mental model of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these activities and going back to the
beginning it was very much that supply
[SPEAKER_01]: through a particular technological
pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of in farming systems
research the surveys I described and that
[SPEAKER_01]: overuse I would say of different sorts of
farm surveys and household surveys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the farmer first era this
promotion of collaborative research seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers as partners and following our
discussion all around that system bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: systems perspectives together with all of
this seeing these innovation network
[SPEAKER_01]: centered around co-development around
involving multi-stakeholder processes
[SPEAKER_01]: often some messy partnerships in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then looking at farmers and their
roles in this farmers seen by the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists themselves in the early days it
was seeing them as there were they would
[SPEAKER_01]: be described in terms of well we have
these progressive farmers who adopt our
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas and technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're often the innovators the adopters
but then there are the laggards you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have various reasons why they
won't adopt these new innovations these
[SPEAKER_01]: new practices and technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to enlighten them to inform
them to show them the way that we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: better approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have those who in the farming
systems era it was seen as objects of
[SPEAKER_01]: study but also sources of information
through the farmer first era as I said an
[SPEAKER_01]: attempt to really see them as colleagues
and collaborators and that continued
[SPEAKER_01]: through this people centered innovation
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of more focus on organized groups
and collective action issues and thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that and exert and the politics of
demand we were calling it of having them
[SPEAKER_01]: articulate what they need the scientists
to be working on not just to be having the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists do the research and then
generate that information even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: done with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the scientists from the farmer
point of view well back in the transfer of
[SPEAKER_01]: technology day they sold extension workers
they never saw the ag scientists who were
[SPEAKER_01]: often developing the new technologies in
practice on station not on the farm so
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't very visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farming system era they used our
land that the scientists would come and do
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments but they would essentially
manage them and then they'd ask some
[SPEAKER_01]: questions of the farmers and during that
farmer first participatory area they were
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes seen as the scientists I'm
talking about from the farmer point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view friendly consumers of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice to have a visit but I've got to
get on with other things you know I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the goats or the cows or the crops to look
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by this era more about there are
multiple sources of information the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists being one of many that we're
getting and that has continued to this day
[SPEAKER_01]: this kind of fracturing of information and
multiple sources available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is how do you weigh up all
that information how do you make use of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and who can you trust to provide you
with the information and insights you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it came to knowledge and disciplines
often in the transfer of technology days
[SPEAKER_01]: it was very much a single disciplinary
approach often related to crop plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those days by the farming systems era
it was an attempt to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: interdisciplinary and bring in even some
social sciences like economics and
[SPEAKER_01]: sociology the interdisciplinary era
followed more about seeing farmers as
[SPEAKER_01]: experts in that environment and then as we
were seeing it possibly more
[SPEAKER_01]: transdisciplinary work more holistic more
bringing together different culturally
[SPEAKER_01]: rooted knowledges and understandings and
trying to meld those together in a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then farmer roles in the early days it
was very much about adopting those those
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred technologies conforming to
conventional practice that green
[SPEAKER_01]: revolution package approach to things then
moving on to be providing information back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the scientists with they then use that
in modifying their their on farm trials
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then during the farmer first era it was
very much about working to support farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: to do their own diagnoses to do much more
experimenting and testing and adapting to
[SPEAKER_01]: their context and giving them the
wherewithal to allow that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then further extending that to what we
were thinking hopefully was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: happening of empowered co generators
knowledge and really involved as
[SPEAKER_01]: innovators and negotiators as I said
thinking about that politics of demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go through all of these
in more detail I've got a few more yellow
[SPEAKER_01]: our arrows here but just I think I've
already covered this to some extent of
[SPEAKER_01]: moving from productivity the farm and then
beyond the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving here as well as I've
described from those technology packages
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way through to networks of
innovators working together
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboratively learning changing the
demanding support the drivers of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these processes moving from that supply
push to a demand pull as we move in this
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly just to highlight one
other thing and that's about the central
[SPEAKER_01]: role of institutions and politics of
moving away from that early period of
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer of technology is a suit that was
assumed away thinking a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: politics was kind of ignored here in the
farmer sit farming systems era where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just kind of a black box it was
recognized but not really examined or or
[SPEAKER_01]: understood during that farmer first here
and particularly as we were getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: the beyond farmer first debates and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was making it much more recognized but
there was still that concerned about that
[SPEAKER_01]: naive populism and then what we were
arguing in the farmer first revisited
[SPEAKER_01]: period that it was much more central to
concerns that if we're really serious
[SPEAKER_01]: about change and transformation then we've
got to get to grips with these
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional and political questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at the end of farmer first revisited
this is 2009 that the book came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Robert we asked him to write the forward
for the book and he always had I always
[SPEAKER_01]: found him to be very insightful and had a
way with words and a good way of capturing
[SPEAKER_01]: some very complex often extended debates
and so he wrote in the opening of farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: first revisited in 20 years more or less
where we have arrived at today if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: another farmer first workshop will they
say in the latter of the latter 2000s by
[SPEAKER_01]: then we could see the problems and
opportunities and the directions needed
[SPEAKER_01]: for change or will they struggle to
imagine themselves trapped in the mindsets
[SPEAKER_01]: methods misunderstandings and this
misprescriptions that have had it earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: prevailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will they see the time of this workshop
and this book as a tipping point a
[SPEAKER_01]: watershed and he went on to say neither is
likely in full what happens next will
[SPEAKER_01]: depend not least on getting the grips with
power politics relationships and
[SPEAKER_01]: reflexivity these have not been
traditional concerns of most funders or
[SPEAKER_01]: those professionally engaged with
agriculture they're outside their normal
[SPEAKER_01]: interests and comfort zones yet they're
crucial for the transformations needed now
[SPEAKER_01]: and he concluded we must find new ways to
engage in constructive dialogue around
[SPEAKER_01]: these themes and to map new directions for
agricultural research education and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now 15 years later wasn't quite 20 but we
can take stock now and see how prescient
[SPEAKER_01]: many of those words in the Roberts preface
were we know that a great deal has changed
[SPEAKER_01]: new shocks and stresses that have been
observed from climate change to COVID
[SPEAKER_01]: pandemic have big implications for farming
livelihoods for agriculture or R&D new
[SPEAKER_01]: economic relationships and connections
lots related to the market and trade
[SPEAKER_01]: increasingly globalized patterns of
exchange but also fragmented linkages as
[SPEAKER_01]: well that create all sorts of problems for
producers trying to sell into different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets in different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: New patterns of urbanization and
industrialization which affects the role
[SPEAKER_01]: of agriculture in different ways as part
of a wider economic and political process
[SPEAKER_01]: and when people talk about structural
transformation of economies that sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture despite its importance which
I'll come back to is somewhat ignored even
[SPEAKER_01]: in places where it has been the foundation
of much of that economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: New agricultural technologies of course
over this period GMOs lots of climate
[SPEAKER_01]: smart climate resilient crops being bred
all over the world both creating new
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities but new risks as we know in
terms of issues around the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: around people's control of different
products and their use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Access of those technologies we know is an
increasing concern as I mentioned patterns
[SPEAKER_01]: of ownership that shift towards the
private sector and we've seen increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and consolidation of those
large agribusinesses that basically are
[SPEAKER_01]: setting the terms of trade and push risk
back down the chain towards the producers
[SPEAKER_01]: who have to bear some of those costs and
also in relation to the provision of
[SPEAKER_01]: global public goods we know that during
the height of the green revolution there
[SPEAKER_01]: was huge investment by the state by
philanthropic organizations like Ford
[SPEAKER_01]: Foundation Rockefeller Foundation that
actually mobilized huge amounts of public
[SPEAKER_01]: support to generate global public goods to
deliver the green revolution the first
[SPEAKER_01]: green revolution since then as I say
there's been this fragmenting this
[SPEAKER_01]: fracturing this capturing by private
actors and interests of large parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: this food system meaning that it's much
harder to generate those public goods and
[SPEAKER_01]: get them out to large numbers of of
producers in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a complex uncertain set of
multi-scale processes lots of interactions
[SPEAKER_01]: taking place this intertwining of the
socio-technical and agro-ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics at different scales the emergence
of intentions and trade-offs between those
[SPEAKER_01]: different pathways to food system
transformation yet a lot remains the same
[SPEAKER_01]: and we really study it hard and look at
what's going on particularly again in
[SPEAKER_01]: those complex diverse risk-prone
environments that I mentioned earlier that
[SPEAKER_01]: that farmer first approaches were really
concentrating on to begin with they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones most affected by all that climate
variability and uncertainty oh I better
[SPEAKER_01]: move on here and also agriculture remains
the mainstay of livelihoods in in many
[SPEAKER_01]: places for many rural people it's also a
driver of sustained employment-based
[SPEAKER_01]: economic development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So against this backdrop we see that the R
&D community continues to struggle with
[SPEAKER_01]: the narrow mindsets restricted methods
rigid organizational structures lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstandings and misprescriptions as
Robert called them about the capabilities
[SPEAKER_01]: and livelihood aspirations of rural people
in many ways these reinforce dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns of of knowledge creation and
application and they exacerbate patterns
[SPEAKER_01]: of inequity and exclusion in the pursuit
of often those silver bullet solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: those techno fixes that we see in
different places that require more nuanced
[SPEAKER_01]: often more gender sensitive more context
specific solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farmer first again we've had three of
them is there a role for some thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that the good news was we know that
we we've learned a lot from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bad practice that often issues about push
the push to go to scale quickly with
[SPEAKER_01]: different technologies innovations can
lead to all sorts of problems Robert
[SPEAKER_01]: called them rushed and wrong and that can
be a real issue yes we need to scale we
[SPEAKER_01]: need scalable technologies innovations
practices but we can get into problems
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the constant tensions between
participatory approaches driven from below
[SPEAKER_01]: and those types of top-down drivers
practices institutional arrangements we
[SPEAKER_01]: also know that there are these entrenched
systemic obstacles to really farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: centered innovation related to those
institutional cultures and practices but
[SPEAKER_01]: the individual mindsets as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seeing how these interlock it help us
to clarify what we need to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us to 35 years after farmer
first and the reason I'm really here with
[SPEAKER_01]: Halle and Martina is to talk about this
we've been invited to submit a paper to
[SPEAKER_01]: the 50th anniversary of the food policy
journal and our focus is really taking
[SPEAKER_01]: stock of what we've learned through those
for that farmer first era and draw
[SPEAKER_01]: together insights around all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot of experience that we're
asking these questions what do we know
[SPEAKER_01]: about the role of farmers and setting
research priorities and shaping food
[SPEAKER_01]: policy and to what extent have national
systems and strategies institutionalized
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful farmer participation in
agriculture research and food policy
[SPEAKER_01]: processes incorporating the principle of
including farmers as co-researchers as
[SPEAKER_01]: joint decision-makers in those processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the team you'll recognize a few of
those names I was just at the pleasure of
[SPEAKER_01]: being at the International Food Policy
Research Institute in Washington with
[SPEAKER_01]: David Spielman who's part of our team and
some of you may know the name Jacqueline
[SPEAKER_01]: Ashby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackie is one of the most influential
people in this world of farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: participatory research over the last 40
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would put her up there with Robert as
someone who's contributed immensely to the
[SPEAKER_01]: field we have the great honor of having
her as part of our team to draw on her
[SPEAKER_01]: wisdom and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our objective is identify and assess
the extent to which different governance
[SPEAKER_01]: and institutional arrangements have
successfully helped to construct an
[SPEAKER_01]: enabling policy environment for farmers to
then shape and influence public R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: agendas in different settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this as a comparative
multi-regional study.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to draw together available
documents so secondary literature combined
[SPEAKER_01]: that with some interviews of key
informants and do a narrative analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: the changing donor landscape of how donors
have framed and responded to these issues
[SPEAKER_01]: over this last four decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to map the policies and
processes and look at this in different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries as I mentioned across these four
dimensions and this was a contribution
[SPEAKER_01]: that Jackie made to our farmer first
revisited workshop in 2007 looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: inclusion empowerment of farmer
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just individual farmers but the
organizations that represent them and may
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to articulate that demand to
negotiate with those different actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running short of time strengthening
the demand side of innovation systems
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporating the accountability to farmer
priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me this is a big thing that's still
missing in many situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decentralization of what she was
describing as flexibilization of farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: research and extension to accommodate that
locally specific focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that top down bottom up tension
and the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then transformation of university and
college teaching curricula an area that we
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up quite a lot in the third volume
of farmer first which we think is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important because the next generation of
researchers and extensionists are being
[SPEAKER_01]: trained in universities worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they being informed about these ideas
and approaches or is it still the original
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of conventional shall we say ideas
and insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we anticipate we'll make a contribution
to the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't belabor this and then to think a
little bit more about how we can
[SPEAKER_01]: critically link farmer first principles to
now this emerging food systems
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things have moved on from agricultural
innovation systems that I described in the
[SPEAKER_01]: late 2000s and now the focus is very much
about food system transformation and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that can go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a 35 years after book yet but
just to give you a sense we think that
[SPEAKER_01]: this will be among the first that will
make a contribution in the area outlined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go into all the details and we're
certainly asking are we still putting
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers first and if so where and under
what conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three volumes are available
through these links.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this gets circulated to people it's now
open access the three books so you're more
[SPEAKER_01]: than welcome to download them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I say this is yet to come as it's
more of an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 10 minutes for questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks very much and it's great to hear
this overview.
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings me back to my undergrad years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmer first work was still very fresh and
Jackie Ashby's work really influenced my
[SPEAKER_03]: own early work in research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm wondering John why the emphasis in
your kind of follow-up paper on the
[SPEAKER_03]: national systems because we know that
agricultural research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Round two.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard all of it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's people online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is why the focus on national
systems because we know that agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: research has really changed so much and
the funding in place for national
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural research is so minuscule
compared to foundation and international
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations who fund even if it's a
national researcher they're getting funds
[SPEAKER_03]: from outside of the national system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that seems like the wrong place to look
for the influence or not of a kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer first agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shall I answer this or do you want to take
a few questions first?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me answer this one because it's a
really important question and it's a fair
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue of course is that ultimately
it's national systems and national
[SPEAKER_01]: government that has a huge role to play in
engaging farmers on the ground of
[SPEAKER_01]: involving farmers in those processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The International Agricultural Research
System, the CGIR, they work in small
[SPEAKER_01]: places here and there but in terms of
ongoing engagement with producers it's
[SPEAKER_01]: national governments that have that
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recognize that things are minuscule but
they also, national governments,
[SPEAKER_01]: are creating the enabling environment or
not of other actors coming in and working
[SPEAKER_01]: with farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen over the last 25 years or so
the role of NGOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them, we can go down the list of
many different groups that are working and
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting farmers in those places but
they can't operate independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to work under the umbrella of
the state and increasingly that's become
[SPEAKER_01]: more restrictive to some extent in
different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some NGOs actually are not no longer able
to work in some places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's that enabling environment,
understanding the role of the state in
[SPEAKER_01]: creating that context and that includes
international actors coming in and working
[SPEAKER_01]: with farmers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not excluding the look at the
international and there are elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have David Spielman from
IFPRI involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're looking at the donor
debate and how that's influencing and
[SPEAKER_01]: changed things over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at that higher level but
our focus is understanding, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the rubber hits the road,
where things are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: operationalized at scale, are we seeing it
happening in different places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it being institutionalized,
embedded in policy and practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Edmar Baye, ag economist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way you integrated
almost in passing that the new focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: systems-wide thinking that is especially
in the light of external shocks such as
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID and climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a growing thinking there that we
need to think beyond the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering what this looks like,
this farmer-first approach, what that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like in this system-wide lens where
we're saying there's much more activity
[SPEAKER_00]: before the farm gate after the farm gate,
the consumer, all these other different
[SPEAKER_00]: players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that we should be
replicating at other nodes or should we
[SPEAKER_00]: still, there's still a merit to be stayed
about really looking at the farm as kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ground zero where these things
meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you'd comment on how
this will evolve in light of this
[SPEAKER_00]: system-wide thinking beyond the farm gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question and I think there are real
tensions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, even under the AIS that
agricultural innovation systems think when
[SPEAKER_01]: that really took off, it was explicitly
stated in a number of the big strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: documents that it was about moving beyond
the farm gate and de-centering or moving
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmer out of the focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is ultimately somebody's
producing our food somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: While everything else, all the value
addition and all the system transformation
[SPEAKER_01]: can be happening in those other places,
and we need to examine all of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand some of those institutional and
governance dimensions of those food
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we cannot ignore or
completely neglect producers and broadly
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm talking about producers,
I'm not only thinking about crop producers
[SPEAKER_01]: but livestock herders and farm workers and
people who actually grow our produce
[SPEAKER_01]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is certainly a need to look at the
rest of that system and understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics of change and what are those
drivers that are being about either system
[SPEAKER_01]: transformation that is sustainable and
equitable and so on, or is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: creating more problems in externalities
and the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the concern is that the role of the
producer, broadly defined, is being
[SPEAKER_01]: neglected to some extent in some of these
debates.
[SPEAKER_01]: As with the AIS discussion, once you get
into that systems analysis, it can become
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat sterile and you can get into a
lot of modeling, a lot of very good
[SPEAKER_01]: technical work, but you miss people and
you miss the role of different forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge as we described in those earlier
farmer first discussions, the role of how
[SPEAKER_01]: that can come together effectively to
produce food that is sustainable in a
[SPEAKER_01]: context which is equitable and just and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not either or, but our argument is
let's not forget about the roots of all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is just on how much of the
metrics on how effective either one of
[SPEAKER_02]: your programs is or was comes from
farmers, data generated by farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular study that we're
proposing now, is that what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, not a lot, but one of the
reasons I'm here is to talk with these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys about the possibility of a larger,
more ambitious project where that farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement could be part of a really
interesting multi-country study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is kind of a rapid piece because
we're drawing largely on the secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: literature as I described because it's got
to be produced for a journal and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: deadline.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relatively short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a rapid review taking stock,
but also I would hope that it will
[SPEAKER_01]: generate questions and point to issues
that we can then take to the field and
[SPEAKER_01]: work with our partners there and their
farmer colleagues to explore those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I would like to take this
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one question online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manushi Trivedi says, very exciting talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to give one example of
scale to quickly techno fails and one case
[SPEAKER_04]: study from the US, if you have it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A case from the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to think about the latter on
that same issue, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: A use case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, a use case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope my dear colleague doesn't get upset
by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years ago, I had been working across
Sub-Saharan Africa with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: international agricultural research
institutions, the International Institute
[SPEAKER_01]: of Tropical Agriculture, what was then
called ICRAF, the World of Agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Center and a variety of national systems
around agroforestry, participatory
[SPEAKER_01]: agroforestry issues, and what was called
alley farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And alley farming was a big deal for a
while in the CGIAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was being promoted widely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea was to have what they called
multi-purpose tree species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were wonder trees that were
developed and tested on the stations of
[SPEAKER_01]: ITA and several other research centers in
different parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did exactly what the scientists
thought they would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very rapidly growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to produce green manure,
green fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could grow poles and fuel wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were used for animal fodder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did all sorts of fantastic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were involved in supporting a whole
farmer participatory engagement process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we did the training with the
scientists, we said, we really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: consult with the farmers to see,
is this something you want and need would
[SPEAKER_01]: work for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's hear more about what you're
already doing through this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair to the colleagues who were
promoting this from the farmer side,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientists who were promoting the
trees and developing the different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties, they were just keen to get
these out to as many producers as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing came to a head in Nigeria where
we did a regional training.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought a group of Anglophone and
Francophone farmers together from across
[SPEAKER_01]: the region for a two-week training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of concern about this
push to get these multi-purpose tree
[SPEAKER_01]: species out because they'd heard some
concerns from the farmers that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: not what they needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very difficult to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took over farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew so quickly that farmers didn't
have the labor to manage the crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: manage these trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they became pests in those fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a big debate at that time in
resistance from some of the scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: until we took a group of colleagues from
Benin who also were Yoruba speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IATA is in the southwest of Nigeria,
which is Yoruba land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went out to speak with a group of
local farmers in those environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met the gentleman who was the star
alley farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the cover of the annual report
of IATA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's had the most perfect alleys that were
right along the roadside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would bring dignitaries from
around the world to see his perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: managed farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Benin colleagues got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were talking and interviewing
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: His neighbor was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying, tell us more about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this man was just waxing, just
enthusiastic of these most wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do everything that the scientists
claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his neighbor said to him in his local
language there, you're full of nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know your real farm looks nothing like
these alleys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our colleagues from Benin overheard
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went into the bush more and actually
looked at where he was growing most of his
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like every other West
African farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a straight line anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all mixed cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing all the usual practices
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had his trees in different
locations that he could manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is 10 years of work, this push to
get these multi-purpose tree species out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, I'm not saying alley farming
is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying this push to go to scale was
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it then led to a real contraction and
ultimately a defunding of that program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a simple salutary lesson of
talking with a gentleman who wanted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in the good books of IATA and keep all
those scientists happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality was he wasn't practicing
what they were preaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody engaged with him to ask him
about his knowledge and his real practices
[SPEAKER_01]: and real priorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are slightly over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
