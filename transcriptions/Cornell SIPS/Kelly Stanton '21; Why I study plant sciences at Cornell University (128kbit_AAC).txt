[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Kelly Stanton and I'm a
freshman undergraduate majoring in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: sciences at Cornell University.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people ask me the question,
why do you choose plant science?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be the next generation of
producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up on a family farm located in
Eastern New York State that is focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: a diverse crop production and annual
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being in that environment is what makes me
happiest and has become my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to carry that production on
to the next generation is even more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the growing human population and a
decrease in sustainable environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture has become a bigger challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is up to us, the younger generation,
to take on that challenge and be the next
[SPEAKER_01]: generation of producers for our main
source of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here at Cornell University to gain a
better knowledge of plants and to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper techniques needed to grow
successful agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am highly confident that Cornell will
give me great success in my future
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural endeavors.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
