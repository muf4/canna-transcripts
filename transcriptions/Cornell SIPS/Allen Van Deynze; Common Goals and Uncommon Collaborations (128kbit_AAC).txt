[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks very much for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been here for a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we missed is that I was a postdoc
here with Mark Sorrels from 93 to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have been here a few times since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really great to come back here to
Emerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I was in Bradfield for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk to you today about
something about common goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really two things I've been
involved with that have been quite
[SPEAKER_00]: rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed to, I think, fit into the
goal of this talk that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we've had going
since 2010 is something that we're calling
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Central at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the idea is to set up
an industry cluster around UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a collaboration between our
center, the Seed Biotechnology Center,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a private company called Seed Quest
run by one person, Francois Corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: whose business is really communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sort of the one-stop shop for all
sorts of things in the seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea behind Seed Central is really
to energize the seed industry around UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its main purpose are threefold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically communication, research
collaborations, and to bring science to
[SPEAKER_00]: market faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all equally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this morning I talked about,
especially the last one, about translation
[SPEAKER_00]: when Charles mentioned how important it is
to get basic ideas to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the space we want to try to
fill in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so much better for somebody
to invest in something that is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to market than something that is
just an idea and a paper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Davis, so this is Davis right here
where all the stars are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of those stars represents a company
that's involved in the seed industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the California Seed Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within an hour at Davis, there's about
50 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within three hours, there's another
cluster in an area around Monterey called
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a total of 100 companies from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in California, there's about 300
companies related to seed in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really wasn't about creating a seed
cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really about organizing something
that was already there for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something some of the
companies that when we started this told
[SPEAKER_00]: us, say, it's already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to formalize it and take
advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since this map is up here on the chair
of the National Association of Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders, and I'll have a slide at the end
for that, this is where we'll be for the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Association of Plant Breeders
meeting this August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to tour both these areas
to see what's growing on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invite everybody over here to come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out Anna is a big
helper in that with the graduates group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we want to do with the Seed
Central is really strengthen the dialogue
[SPEAKER_00]: between Davis and the seed industry,
foster research collaborations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and technology transfers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, also attract new
companies to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a list of our current members.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a membership program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly inexpensive for members to be
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just supports really some of the events
that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that we kept the
membership very low so that small
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and large companies can join.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10 countries represented there
from different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have companies for example like East
West Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based out of Thailand,
but they're still members with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually very active members.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come by California where they may
have some business and they'll stop in and
[SPEAKER_00]: visit us a number of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So communication is really the basis of
this whole program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason it works is that it's so
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we're doing is providing a venue
for communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest really has come
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every second Thursday of every month we
actually have a networking event similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to this and a seminar speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that speaker can be either from
industry, the food industry, the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have an hour and a half of
networking before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the critical part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have hors d'oeuvres.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have free food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students are always coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly we get on average now about
120 people come to these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our average for the last seven
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last seven years we get about 120
people every event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about half industry and the rest
faculty and students.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I said this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your elevator speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're meeting the CEOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're meeting the research directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking to plant breeders,
seed industry professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really been interesting just watching
what's going on at the networking event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that there's seasoned students
and there's new students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of interaction between
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always said, and I know
personally, all the best ideas come over
[SPEAKER_00]: these type of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't put people in a room and say,
don't come out till you have a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just don't work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say something and you say,
oh, I can leverage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what these networking events
have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had over 1,800 people so far in five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 different companies and 15
universities have participated in our
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening too is that because this
is on the schedule, it's on our website,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always the second Thursday of every
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had companies now plan their
meetings internally around these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good thing they tell us because
those are the events sometimes we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of Syngenta is going to show up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All our breeders from international were
having a meeting this month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get a big boost on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happened many times now where
companies are focusing their meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: around our meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really expands basically your
reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We highlight both applied and basic
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The applied science, the plant breeders,
those people are always coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: always going.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've added to this is what we're
calling value added afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every quarter we have a whole afternoon
of speakers or workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is allows us to focus
say on specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we had an afternoon on gene
editing, another one on high throughput
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one we had was on women in
science or HR and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those afternoons we're actually
pulling in some of our more basic
[SPEAKER_00]: biologists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're introducing them to some of the
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only the members get access to these
afternoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the advantages to be a
member.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're invited to come meet,
short talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a half hour, 15 minute talks that
some of the basic scientists that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: usually working with these companies or
working even in the seed industry could be
[SPEAKER_00]: new technology that they're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it introduces them to the industry and
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have a student program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody can walk up and have that
elevator speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we train students how to get that
elevator speech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We train the students how to interview
well and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a quarterly program to
basically promote the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have regular contact with both the
students and the HR managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bankers come to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local bankers are coming to our events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller colleges and schools are coming to
our events.
[SPEAKER_00]: HR personnel are routinely coming to our
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just the researchers coming
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is really to get investment into
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or into the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a prize system for the
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just put your name in.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get a prize, you have to get a card
from somebody from industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more cards you get during the
networking event, the more chances you
[SPEAKER_00]: have for the prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first year, the prize used to be an
iPod.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every kid had an iPod at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, one of the prizes is you get to
shadow say a plant breeder for a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of the quarter,
we pull the three students at one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sit down and go for dinner with
research executive and HR managers and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing this again for five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working out really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a chance to shadow somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick their brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then meet with their boss in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also human resources to get ideas of
what is important to your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to work for your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or should I work for your company?
[SPEAKER_00]: We find mentors in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these turn out into internships
and employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the internships have become prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or say some large prizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highlighted EastWest Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, they're based in northern
Thailand, in Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a fantastic spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we want to sponsor an
internship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grand prize for the students for
the year, they had to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an interview process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got three months all expenses paid to
work at EastWest Seeds in Chiang Mai in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, they have one in Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had one in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided not to do that one for
obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other companies have done the same
thing, where they've had interns go
[SPEAKER_00]: through different places across the United
States and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So opportunities for internships and
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Workshops to prepare students for soft
skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that elevator speeds, how to
interview, how to work in teams,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do what we call a bag lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go at lunchtime to a seed company
and talk to who's working there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just very informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're doing that in the summer time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it every season, every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I talked about internships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet, I mentioned, with the HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We meet with HR people quite a bit from
the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a whole session asking the
question, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of people do you need in the
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it graduates at the bachelor's level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it plant breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it crop physiologists?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tech people in ag engineering,
nutritionists, so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've opened this event even to high
school students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just plant science faculty
and students that come.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people now coming from
even ag engineering, from nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: really the food space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, facilitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to make it easier and also
less expensive for members to work with UC
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've developed what's called a CAP,
or corporate affiliate partnership
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas UC Davis has agreed that if you
can find one partner, another industry
[SPEAKER_00]: partner, and you become a consortium where
Anne is two, UC Davis will basically cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the indirect rate in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of 57%, you're coming in at
25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really, really worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in my position with the Seed
Center, I'm an industry university
[SPEAKER_00]: liaison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always talking to industry about
research and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of really facilitating this
research by saying, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give you a cut on the rate if you
can find another partner and call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: consortium, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Examples of partnerships sometimes are
not, it's easy to find a partner with a
[SPEAKER_00]: common thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, two companies may be
competing and they say, well, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on this, but maybe not with another
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've put together, for example,
a fruit company was talking to an onion
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a talk on flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked together and he said,
you know what, let's work on flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're funding this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both interested on flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A processing tomato and a fresh market
tomato, they don't compete in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working together on two companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are both working on tomato,
but not competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put these sometimes non-obvious
partnerships together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have partnerships, of course,
for pre-competitive research.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a bunch of pepper companies,
a bunch of spinach companies, or so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a year, we have what we're calling
the veg R&D forum, where we spend the day
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing specific topics on
pre-competitive research priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way of communication across
the industry for, again, to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the priorities, the top
priorities in the seed space, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding space, even in the processing
space for fruit and vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get some projects that come out of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you measure success?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 2010, 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding a three to the mergers and
equities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had 10 mergers and acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our area, we've had 10 mergers and
acquisitions, 10 expansions of companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 10 new companies come in the last five
years, or the last seven years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, in this case, that are in the
area close to UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all companies that have expanded
one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've hired a significant amount of
people, or expanded their facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: or added programs to their businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ones that have been
acquired.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are small companies that have been
acquired by one or another company in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area, and are still working in UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of new companies that
put new sites in the area of UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These smaller companies tend to be,
a lot of them are service companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually quite a growth in the
microbiome area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Davis, there's five companies working
on trying to figure out the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiomes, understand microbiomes as
it's related to plant growth, and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also really, much of that is
an expansion out of Pam Marrone that
[SPEAKER_00]: really came out of UC Davis initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she created a company called AgQuest,
which got bought out by Bayer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the CEO of that spun out and made
Bioconsortia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Nova Zimes is there with
Monsanto, and there's a couple others that
[SPEAKER_00]: are there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why join Seed Central?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really comes down to the
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're doing is facilitating
communication to really capture what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do for the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to join Seed Central, you become a
partner in an ag industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a number of service
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come out, whether they're
genotyping, or even this microbiome can be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a service company in some cases
that have come to UC Davis or the area
[SPEAKER_00]: around Davis just to be near the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: In January, we had a trade show of
companies, and it's actually Francois Corn
[SPEAKER_00]: from SeedQuest lives in the San Francisco
area in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought 16 companies, and there's
only two that I've ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all spin outs out of Stanford
and Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all had application to the seed
industry, whether they were very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one that was measuring pollen
viability, very, very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like this that are all
potential users, I mean, companies for the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed industry to use, and researchers
here, and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all these were just small spin outs
from the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monthly working meetings, and this is
really the basis of everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: strong connection, improved the connection
to Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hardest things from the outside
is, and I'm sure it's the same thing at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, is somebody from the outside is
like, OK, I've got a problem in wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should I talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a number of plant scientists,
and you really don't know who to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've become that portal as a seed
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually, on our websites,
we have people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of our faculty that
were interested in ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also basic biology, self-identify into
five or six classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, if I'm interested in ag
engineering, here are the people in ag
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering focusing on very specific
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's sort of the one stop shop idea to
try to make that connection a little
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discover new science and technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's more than just a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our website, we want to try to go,
and these are the things we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know, we're happy to
point people and connect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then long term objectives and
pre-competitive work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really have a vibrant student program
that's integrated where you have a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with the industry and get an idea
of what the priorities are going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the short and near future, both for you as
a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the truth is, in plant breeding,
I don't know what the number is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least 75%, probably 85% of the jobs
in plant breeding are going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably maybe seven or eight
faculty positions that I think that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of in plant breeding in the United
States right now that colleges are
[SPEAKER_00]: applying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to switch now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I call this a common
collaboration, where it's obvious people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the seed industry want to work with
people in the seed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my title.
[SPEAKER_00]: The play on my title is Common Goals,
which is essential for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a common goal if you're
going to work with someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be a win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm very fortunate to work on another
project, which we call an uncommon
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration, which we're calling the
African Orphan Crops Consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stephen set me up perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see where a lot of the things
he said will come up through my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very fortunate to work with this
fellow, Howard Yano Shapiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in my building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Howard is a chief ag officer for Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Howard actually was the founder of
Seeds of Change, a small organic seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company, so really to connect to the
players here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But importantly, Howard is a fellow at UC
Davis, and one of our major collaborators
[SPEAKER_00]: also at MIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a fellow at the World Agri-Fortu
Center, which is a CJR Center in Nairobi
[SPEAKER_00]: in forestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do these things actually have in
common?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll walk through this a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard, being a fellow at Davis,
and he's on a lot of advisory councils for
[SPEAKER_00]: the dean and things like this on food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dean used to have these
five-minute talks at lunchtime for new
[SPEAKER_00]: assistant professors just to see what are
these new professors going to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a five-minute talk from a person
called Christine Stewart.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in food science.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a new assistant professor about
seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave a talk on stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she basically mentioned stunting is
both physical, neurological, and economic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're stunted neurologically or
physically, you're not going to be sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: in this room trying to figure out the
latest models for genomic selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't even make it to Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the numbers that are
flabbergasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: 37% of the people, it's actually 40 now,
the latest numbers in Africa are stunted
[SPEAKER_00]: due to malnutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this country, 7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not immune to it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the common goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really struck a nerve for Howard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got me on board really quickly as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see these numbers, he was like,
can we do something about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Howard was in a position, being from
Mars, they do call themselves Martian
[SPEAKER_00]: within company as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is a private company that
gave him the leeway and said, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what, you can do something about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you a little bit to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Howard really, he didn't fund a
project for this, but he got it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about stunting, and this is
not to pull at your heartstrings,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of, but you all recognize Oliver in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about stunting, it's not about
more food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't use the word food security
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about nutritional security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have plenty of calories in this
country, but yet 7% of the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have probably plenty of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the wrong food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple movies that I'll try to
get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know carrot is good in vitamin A.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your normal vision at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's essential to see for night vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people that don't have enough
beta carotene or vitamin A, they really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually can see some shadows on the
computer in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And something as simple as eating your
carrots or your tomatoes or your peppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically anything orange is going to save
you from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuts, very high in zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zinc is directly related to stunting and
stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So zinc is an essential element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we can eat mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can eat all sorts of vegetables to get
zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these fellows just don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're stunted, this is an
irreversible problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, OK, you get fed when you're
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're stunted in the first two years
of life, and it actually starts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother right when she's pregnant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important in basically young
mothers as well as young children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a matter of getting a good
diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this is a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer we thought about is we can
save this through seed and plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have an idea of what that
seed is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It weighs less than half a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any guesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put up your hand if you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this when Howard first put
this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It weighs less than half a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't look like much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's going to be two weeks old,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ideas yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that seed, what's cool, can grow into
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is General Sherman.
[SPEAKER_00]: General Sherman is three football fields
high, 300 meters tall, weighs as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: 747s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know how the water gets to
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was all in that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what plant breeding can do,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking to the choir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea we had is what if we can jump
start some of these crops in Africa that
[SPEAKER_00]: are already nutritious, they're already
part of their diets, and really jump start
[SPEAKER_00]: them with genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is the same thing as putting up
cell phone towers instead of landlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody in Africa has a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the service in Nairobi is better
than it is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly better than it is in some
of the Midwest states that I've been in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is that we would sequence
genomes as reference genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would re-sequence at least 100 lines
for each of those 100 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would train about 120 breeders to
use the information in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is for Africa, by Africa,
and to really make ourselves obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing is it's all
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first paper is going to come out
probably this month on finger millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting everything up on
gigascience, which really is a note on a
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be nice on my resume to have
101 nature or science covers, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of work to do the same
thing over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is to put everything in the
public and really raise the bar for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the set of uncommon collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unique about this, of course,
is it's not a bunch of seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not USAID or a bunch of foundations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's who we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the World Agri-Forsu Center is a CJR
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're our hosts in Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I talked a little about some
of the work they're doing in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are really doing top,
top research in the area of trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a bit more, but half the crops
are working on our trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: NEPAD is the New Partnership for African
Development, which is the basic
[SPEAKER_00]: development arm for the African Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essential for basically our
long-term goal is really to make as many
[SPEAKER_00]: countries as we can self-sufficient and
invest in breeding programs to sustain
[SPEAKER_00]: these breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the African Union comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their CEO has made our project their top
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the past president of Niger,
Ibrahim Iyaki.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got that government clout to ask
governments to invest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars put in some money for the Plant
Breeding Academy, BGI, you're familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with, sequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: LGC is providing data points for
genotyping for anybody working in Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: on these crops, basically at cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Becca Elery is basically a development
nonprofit group in Nairobi, training
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, also their labs and things like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're training the breeders at the UC
Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google's letting us use their pipe,
as they call it, to transfer data on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: AGRA is the African Green Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, they're a nonprofit in
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're funding us for teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also doing a lot of good work in
PhDs and starting up small seed companies
[SPEAKER_00]: in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the University of Ghent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a bioinformatics network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yvonne, the peer, is helping us annotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: FAO is doing some promotion for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermo Fisher has given us a number of
reagents and lab equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: World Wildlife Federation was one of the
groups that founded us, has helped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: UNICEF is doing some development from work
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyverse, you're familiar with,
with his eye plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to host all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: ARC is Ag Research Council in South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing some sequencing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Illumina, I'm going to talk more
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also making some really
significant contributions to the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: both in reagents and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's who we needed, as opposed to who
can spend some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an open collaboration, but these are
the major partners in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did we choose 101 crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent out 100 surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 106, which is about 100 times
better than most surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually get 6% back, not 106 back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really an ugly survey,
long answer only kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the crops that Africans are
eating that are nutritious currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are not being worked on for plant
breeding or developed?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only way I could think of the
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember 101 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't, I haven't heard about two
thirds of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this, you know, all the calories
in the world comes from poalis,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wheat, maize, and rice comes from a single
family of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in 28 different orders, 45 families,
101 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, he used to be the head of our
pomology department a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started UC Davis,
said something tongue in cheek where he
[SPEAKER_00]: said, you know, the, the grain crops of
the world may feed the world, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit and vegetables make food worth
eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was just tongue in cheek about it,
but he's right in the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is, of course, we need all of
the above on your plate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's as many as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steven just mentioned Clioma ganondra,
the spider plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the poisonous one that shoots
out these little shoots as an ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: that at least my mother had in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brassicalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown in basically all the countries
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's also grown in South Africa,
but they left it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, what it's interesting about a
spider plant is I've been in a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it in every country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little, little more texture to it
than spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually twice as good for you as
spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the red points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just crazy in zinc, iron,
vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is without any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a C4 plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew about 50 lines in Davis last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just loves Davis because it's a C4
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it back three times in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant will put on a kg of dry matter
in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically alfalfa for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a C4, we've got some
studies going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a C3 cousin as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some data that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sequenced 48 lines so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: These 48 lines we ran through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a collaboration with the
University of Vagen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did all the metabolomics on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's different populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the Asian populations that came
out of PCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more of the African types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the Asian types are high in
vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the African types are high in vitamin
A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the red in between is our new
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 200 lines which we collected
in West Africa with our partner out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Benin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're quite unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're somewhere in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already got new germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some great diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: These look different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they're nutritionally quite
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're funded by a group out of
Netherlands called NWUOTRO to do some work
[SPEAKER_00]: on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start breeding the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start breeding program, made the
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in our second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got funded again from another
program to keep breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're breeding also in Kenya for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been an exciting result for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have this kind of data in my PEPR
program, all the nutritional profiles they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we've run it on, you know,
on Creome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are these plants interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a group, kind of the Horcris
program, that did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a group out of Purdue from Stephen
Weller.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at African leafy vegetables in
West Africa and looked at their price in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones with the red dots are the ones
we've chosen to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all leafy grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the highest ones were the ones,
it turns out, they were the ones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: working on your spider plant amaranth,
nightshades.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about pumpkin leaves,
you know, and these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a market for these plants
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the plants that are found in
the market already.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not things, we're not trying to
introduce a new plant and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: try it, you'll like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eating it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be cool if you can get,
you know, 10 fruit instead of one fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it and be able to not only sustain
your family, but sell some to your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're resequencing 100 lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the criteria we came up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lines, including the seed or the
clones, must be publicly available and put
[SPEAKER_00]: in the gene bank so that anybody can breed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selection, so it's publicly available
and current land races in Africa or lines
[SPEAKER_00]: being grown in Africa, lines with unique
nutritional productivity traits or broad
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really covers most of the things,
most things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we'll focus maybe a third
on each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're developing these germplasm
pools with the breeders in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The truth is this is where this program
has really leveraged a lot of consortia
[SPEAKER_00]: from around the world that are working on
some of these plants, but with connection
[SPEAKER_00]: to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice lab in Nairobi to do the
resequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I co-supervise this fellow here,
Prasad Hendry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prasad is just a fantastic lab manager and
program manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two personnel, full-time
technicians working with him that the
[SPEAKER_00]: World Agroforestry Center is paying for.
[SPEAKER_00]: He essentially runs the research programs
at the World Agroforestry Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together we run the lab in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, Life Technologies, now Thermo
Fisher, donated basically the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the first four of 10 protons,
ion protons came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: New technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They donated part of the reagents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donated these instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company went a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't improve the instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 10 times more expensive to
run than the current materials on
[SPEAKER_00]: Illumina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we shut down the lab and said,
I can't afford to run this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reagents are eating us alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illumina walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They donated HN4,000 for us, and we're
getting reagents from other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, they just announced,
we made this deal at PAG a couple months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and it's actually, we just got the
customs form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday on this to come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, this project has been fantastic
in this way to get, and this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive instrument, and Illumina donated
it to the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were really at a loss with
these instruments, I won't even give you
[SPEAKER_00]: this instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too expensive to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a diagnostic instrument at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on 29 different crops right
now that are on sequencers at one level or
[SPEAKER_00]: another at BGI or other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: With other partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're resequencing these crops right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing transcriptomes on some of the
harder tree crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, we got $100,000 worth of reagents
from Illumina as part of their Greater
[SPEAKER_00]: Good initiative, which was a nice
surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to put that towards the
transcriptomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the African Research Council,
so the hardest part about somebody giving
[SPEAKER_00]: you reagents is that you have to find
money or the person to run it,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay the person to run those assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the African Research Council,
basically, we talked to them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: said, no, we got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're running all the samples for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the hardest part of the project,
is getting these samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're running 15 tissues on each of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only one lane per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get 15 tissues out of a tree that
only flowers one part time of the year
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the top of a mountain,
it takes us all year to get the RNA
[SPEAKER_00]: samples for some of these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to make sure we get fruit
and flowers and all the different tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: types represented and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, the hardest part of this
project is really getting samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing for the resequencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure we're resequencing
relevant samples when we pick 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be releasing these genomes hopefully
by this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, this paper is going to come
out in the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing final edits on it last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice array of genomes coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice they're not the biggest genomes,
but it's good to start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is finger millet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's custard apple, African eggplant,
and another legume, which you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is acacia, which is a legume,
phytonherbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had dead genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about another 30 lines resequenced
right now on sequencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is marula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marula is a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a fun thing about marula,
just on YouTube, look up drunken animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see these African animals eating
fermented fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And marula is quite a good looker,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moringa, this is really a super tree,
especially in India and Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the oil is very good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant is sort of good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these genomes are going to release
for sure in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant breeding academy, this is something
at Davis we've been doing for now for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years at the professional level,
where we've had academies in Davis,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe, and in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are more for companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what Mars and Agri have funded UC
Davis to do, is to start a program there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to train the top breeders
in Africa and make sure they're using all
[SPEAKER_00]: the techniques you heard about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best objective phenotyping,
good design, statistics, and also
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a third of the class is
application of genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other two-thirds make sure that
everybody's got a good background in
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative genetics, and statistics,
and selection theory, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by design, it's a small class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at most 30 students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a combination of lectures,
exercises, and hands-on workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the most valuable part of
this, and this is taught really at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll show you the teachers in a
minute, and you'll understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most valuable parts of this is
that everything is done in R, and is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the set of R strips that comes from
this class that are related to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding are really a treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every lecture gets, we talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do an exercise in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give the R scripts and send them
examples with homework to go home with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, they do a final thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of a mini thesis where they have
to do a presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with them to develop the thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to pick a crop and a concept
that they've learned in class that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have 30 minutes in class to
present it, and another 20 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: critique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing about African students,
they are very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a problem to get a question
when you're teaching African students.
[SPEAKER_00]: You teach in Asia, you have to pull a
question out of the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Africa, it's like, OK, we're two hours
in this one-hour lecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're ruthless on each other as
critiques in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, why do you use this design?
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But through the class, you have 25 people
talking through the class.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cover all the concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this in the last week and a half of
our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pretty much cover all the concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learn so much about the different
crop types, from trees to root crops to
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf crops, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Annuals, things that are sterile,
dioecious, monoecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really cover a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you learn about applying plant
breeding techniques, really, to any crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an idea of some of the
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Bususo Manvakani.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the chief officer at Zimbabwe Crop
Research Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's working on Bambera groundnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking really at early maturity is her
main problem in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Samson was in our second class.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's working on shaytree in Uganda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Julia is actually an instructor for the
AGRA program, for the PhD program in
[SPEAKER_00]: KwaZulu in South Africa, working on sweet
sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Enoch is our collaborator,
also, in Benin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Graduated from the second class.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's working on spider plant, climae
ganondra, and a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are instructors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do enough classes that we really have
to hire professional instructors in this
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own faculty, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a breeding class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a class in Europe going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a class every two weeks,
it seems, that there's a class that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically, we hire consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to get our faculty in as much as we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't say enough about working with
Rita Mumm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rita is a corn breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this GMO problem, it's her fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: She developed MonA10 when she was with
DeKalb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was her first transgenic corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: She developed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been in the corn industry for
the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she developed the plant breeding
center at Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: She started that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now she's one of our primary
instructors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she coordinates our African program,
our African plant breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Yago Haley, Yago is a UC Davis grad
who can teach statistics to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just makes it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll give you all the R scripts,
importantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Walsh, I don't think he needs any
instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know Lynch and Walsh, he's the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Volume two is coming out very shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, Todd Waines, a curbits breeder at
North Carolina that's been with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding Academy since we started back in
2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken Bradford's my boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a seed specialist, seed dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raleigh Zurich runs all our educational
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a canola breeder out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been in the industry for about 17,
18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really a great teacher when it comes
to business and just basically basic
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding techniques and application of
technologies like haploid and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just fantastic people to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeps it busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we do a lot in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the basis of all our classes
is this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our classes, we've been asked to put them
online a number of times and just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do the highest level plant
breeding in class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, online.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, you need to be able to talk the
problems through and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we spent a lot of time doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second class of four, we graduated in
December 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Nairobi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far 48 students, 19 countries,
10 women.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 275 applicants for our third class.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 250 for our second class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rita and I went through all the
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got it down to we'll invite 35
students, half women, five new countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have countries like Namibia
represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some countries and many, many different
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're up to about 60 crops
represented right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 60 corn breeders in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have 60 crops represented with just
30 students, 30, 40 students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's working on three, four crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are the only plant
breeders for their crop, certainly in
[SPEAKER_00]: their country, if not in their region.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this grant do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a number of grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say I'm a collaborator on all
these grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certainly the leader of any of
these grants, except the agri one.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are leveraging this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a small breeding grant in Cleome
from this Dutch foundation, Lentil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with, it was mentioned
that, I think Stephen mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Canadians, so Kirsten Beth,
was also one of my colleagues at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University at Guelph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always build your network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be scared to call them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's running the Lentil program.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just got $4 million to develop the
Lentil genome and application of genomics
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Lentil, we're working in Africa with
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's supplying a lot of the lines that
we're re-sequencing and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then access to the genome,
which she already did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no point in us doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with Katrine DeVos,
Jeff Bennetson.
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Georgia on finger millet,
on Fonio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got renewed a USCID grant with
NSF.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, again, USCID grant to work on
Shea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a group of students,
as well as Iago and myself are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yam, we're working with Berkeley on
working Yam and breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these grants have breeders in
Africa that are using the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using their parents to work on
their developing the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agra is funding our plant breeding
academy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk to you quickly about
Mowbreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually $10 million missing
through that number from the government of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethiopia, which we just found out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Faroo Mekib.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a class one graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Faroo was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of these guys who sat in the
back of the room, quiet guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he had a question, it was the big
visionary question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came to his thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was missing all the deadlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going on with Faroo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not like him to be missing
all these deadlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he comes up to his thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, I want to work on nine crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Faroo, you have to work on one
crop and focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to work on one crop,
one concept on your thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also convinced my government to work
on 38 indigenous crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Ethiopia, and train 10 graduate
students to work on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did this within nine months of when we
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his government to work on basically
to invest in plant breeding in his
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were just flabbergasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Enoch did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Enoch Ashigandako is from Benin,
small country in Benin, very active
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first six months, he had just met
in the second class Julia, Levi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Abush from Ethiopia, Namibia,
South Africa, and then also happiness in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he put together a grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got 1 and 1 half million euros to
work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to fund 40 graduate students
on 10 orphan crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all breeding grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's EU, they have a nice
collaboration also to bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a group out of Montpellier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an open consortia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all consortia that we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the CGR centers, most of these
consortia are around crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our website if you want to learn
more about what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have the mortar type hats when
you graduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a nice Plant Breeding Academy hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very coveted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get your thesis throughout the
week, they get a Plant Breeding Academy
[SPEAKER_00]: hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always made it very clear there
were those people with hats and those
[SPEAKER_00]: without throughout the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys wore their hats at the hotel,
at the pool, everywhere until everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: got their hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal I had, this was just an
example of this was all driven by common
[SPEAKER_00]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we got these common goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaborators took over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody said, OK, I want to be part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I contribute?
[SPEAKER_00]: And every company contributed differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to hear about the
capacity of building
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm curious if the folks who come to
the Academy have expressed an interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: or are committed to working on any of the
crops that are being genotyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, are the students that
we're training working on orphan crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not initially all working on
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we choose the students, we're not
choosing only people that work on orphan
[SPEAKER_00]: crops because by definition, we probably
wouldn't have that many students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say about 3 quarters in the end
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we start, maybe half are working
already on orphan crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe another quarter of them pick it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have maize breeders,
rice breeders, cassava breeders,
[SPEAKER_00]: cowpea breeders, and so on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of them will pick up a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we try to get a lot of them to do is
really focus because most of them come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're working on three crops,
some four crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, well, maybe you should just
drop two of those and make a difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: two instead of try to go on four crops and
probably not make a pile of damage
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't try to breed four crops at once as
being the single breeder in the country
[SPEAKER_00]: for it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this has done is really it's the
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I didn't say really is the network of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These 48 students work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have private Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you an example of how six people
got together, got a grant within six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them knew each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even working on the same crops
or the same countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was six people, six countries,
10 crops that they focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the network.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating an African, speaking of
national associations, they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: creating an African association of plant
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually using NEPBs, our model to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have a conference in
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the first African plant breeding
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, they'll invite everybody
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to them, the most important thing
about the conference was just being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to share their ideas and promote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan?
[SPEAKER_04]: The 101 plant is really just amazing in
breadth and scope.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you, looking ahead, how do you keep
things like shade breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have this shade genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you keep them just falling on the
cliff in five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you keep interest in those
orphan crops is really a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genome is just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeders are the ones who are going to
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the order that we're doing things is
really driven by the interest that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shea wasn't necessarily high on our list
of things to do, or low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have now two or three breeders in Shea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a program to do the genome with
USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, it became top of the list
as priority.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have two breeders working on Shea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're committed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been working on Shea for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't just adopt this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these crops, people are
working on already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we didn't hear about it
doesn't mean it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing with spider plant is a new
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got two breeders working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed you the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of Africa is eating that plant
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It already has some pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, spider plant is going to be one of
the big success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that market is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the breeder driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be successful in 100
crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have 25 breeding programs at the end
of this, or in 10 years, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be different levels of
success, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that a lot of these things
that we call miter crops are becoming much
[SPEAKER_05]: more cosmopolitan in the way you can go
into a grocery store and put amaranth seed
[SPEAKER_05]: and teff and whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you wouldn't have seen it 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the markets are growing
simultaneously for everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest market for Africa is not
Europe, what a lot of people think or what
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of Europe thinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest market for Africa is urban
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because more and more people are going to
the cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really about feeding their
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about Europe or us or anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we get a spinoff out of that,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why our goal is really to
replace ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I didn't say is we're training a
number of people in our classes to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the program over and also train at a lower
level, train technicians in breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by far, the market is their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the design of this
program is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's designed for African crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for sure, there's some, I've tried
about, my goal is to try all 101 species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried about 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things like mango bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a check on it, say not doing that
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question?
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason we got low quality crops is
because we've bred historically for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you want to introduce quality
breeding for new crops, how can you do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, we have to be careful
with breeding for quality or breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield because we might lose quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these crops are inherently nutritious
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they were chosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of legumes on there,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protein is going to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the point is, and for vegetable
breeding, quality is actually always
[SPEAKER_00]: number two on the priority list,
where a cereal crop or a field crop yield
[SPEAKER_00]: is the first three priorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yield here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, if we get a base quality,
we can sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of our crops have not improved in
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, they've gone negative in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the tools to do it now that we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think understanding quality and
being able to measure it more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can learn by our mistakes,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these crops, it's really not
about breeding for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about increasing yield and
maintaining quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because we weren't paying
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we lost quality in tomato is
because we didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were selecting for long shelf life
tomatoes, but we weren't tasting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, that's what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Harry Klee's science article would
argue strongly against that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a matter of paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it's about,
is to be able to measure it and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what that quality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is difficult, I agree, because
flavor, for example, is not a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: To convince the farmer to grow some
variety of less yield, it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you buy in supermarkets,
it's much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about Africa,
it's such a different place than here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there aren't that many middle people in
Africa right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmer is both the consumer,
the salesperson, and the grower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is that, again,
they can produce more than they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Agra has done, which is quite
impressive, in the last, say, five or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years, they've been able to create
116 different small co-op type seed
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're not doing is really the next
step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to create the venue to get
better varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to convince farmers to grow new
varieties and convince them to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I grow my variety, you're going to get
better yield, or quality, or season,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever you're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also understand the seed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's seed companies now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very serious seed companies
going into Africa now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seed companies know how to handle seed
and keep it pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some farmers' co-ops,
for example, where all the villagers come
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring in all the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The co-op mixes all the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give it to everybody next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They destroyed your variety in one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to make sure there's that
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gates is spending a lot of money in seed
systems as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really complements as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a question from the webinar.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the funding given by the African
governments involved, do you see more
[SPEAKER_04]: interest in funding from these
governments?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's in store for the future
funding-wise sustainability programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, funding is never, there's no such
thing as constant funding, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our program is, right now we're
committed to do what we said we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, basically the 100 crops times 100
times 120 breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting additional funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with the funding from AGRA,
we've got very significant contribution to
[SPEAKER_00]: train more breeders with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a continuous program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is really not to leave in the
program, just say, hey, that was great,
[SPEAKER_00]: and slap ourselves in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goal is to make sure we have things in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these other companies, so I'll give
you an example for genotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can create genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't use them, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just signed another letter with LGC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We extended it another four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't even a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're committed to making genotyping
accessible to the breeders, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be an evolution thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're always open to more funding,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope we can attract some really big
players into this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no magical answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with Ethiopia, and actually I would
say the Benin grant is pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a government that's Ethiopia,
I think, gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's going to do it,
they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have 38 indigenous orphan
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many crops that are,
that's the center of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few years ago, I remember I saw a
report, I think it was from TGIR,
[SPEAKER_02]: about the permanent erosion on talent in
breeding capacity in African fauna.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see how your project can help to
reverse that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But have you guys in these years that have
been working on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Become more encouraged about the future
and think that trend can be reverted?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you talking maybe, you said erosion
of breeding and maybe brain drain at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, perhaps, as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sort of by design, our program is
in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one point where some things
were happening in Kenya that made it
[SPEAKER_00]: unsafe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody had suggested, well,
why don't you do it in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would just quit the program first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to avoid brain drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: USAID actually avoids brain drain in the
sense they won't give you a visa for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come, say, to Cornell, you have to
leave the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get like a two or three year visa
for your education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very encouraged on the talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that we're recruiting,
these guys got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these guys are really,
really smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They walk out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the statistics and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the background going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is our partnership with AGRA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AGRA has trained 60 PhDs now in the
last seven, eight years in Africa through
[SPEAKER_00]: the Waki and the Aki program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually recruiting some of
their people and giving them kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level because we're actually teaching
higher than a regular PhD and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 275 applicants, of course,
they weren't all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But half of them were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 105 PhDs that we screened through
out of those 275.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wish we could invite 60 instead of
the 35 we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Reid and I thought there's 60 here
that could probably go through our prior
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go through our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main criteria to get in our
program is they have to have an active
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want administrators or even just
fresh PhDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to have an active breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our number one criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm actually blown away on how smart
these guys are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big hurdle to me is going to be to
get their governments to fund these
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's thank Alan one more time.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to see you in Davis,
August 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise it's going to be hot and it
won't be raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
