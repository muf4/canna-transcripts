[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Adam for the nice introduction and
also great invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really a great pleasure to visit
Cornell and see many good friends and see
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met when I was a first year graduate
student back in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really an impressive visit this
morning to see many of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to present some of my
work after my job in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I titled my work on the non-self
recognition and signaling mechanism in
[SPEAKER_00]: plant immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is although we seemingly live in
a very peaceful, wonderful world,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in fact we are surrounded by all kinds
of enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria, viruses, and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact is we're all healthy most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And resistance is the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Disease is rather an exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in large attributed by the robust
innate immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the heart of the immune system is
the individual capacity to recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: self versus non-self to elicit the defense
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key to a healthy immune system is
its ability to distinguish between the
[SPEAKER_00]: body's own cells and recognize them as
self and foreign cells as non-self.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this echoes a famous saying I learned
when I was an elementary school student
[SPEAKER_00]: from Shunzi, a famous Chinese philosopher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing your enemy and yourself you can
fight without defeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compared with the animals, plants are
even more vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sensitive when they get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way to talk to doctors to get rescue,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They also don't have the adaptive immune
system as the animal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also don't have the specialized
somatic immune cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we share is this robust innate
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the innate immune system in plants has
been classified as a two tiered defense
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perception of cells, I mean perception
of microbial components by cell surface
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor trigger the first line of defense
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also terms as PRR, pattern triggered
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those microbial components collectively
they work hard, termed as PAMP or MAMS,
[SPEAKER_00]: stands for pathogen or microbial
associated molecular patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pathogen infection also often trigger
damage to the host cell, which generate
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous damage associated molecular
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collectively those things can be
perceived by the cell surface pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in plants what is striking is we know
those microbial components are perceived
[SPEAKER_00]: by receptor like protein or receptor like
kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in plants there are up to several
hundreds of these kind of proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: In punctures animals for instance human up
to 10 TLR proteins perceiving those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial components.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may provide thoughts for plant
cell surveillance system to recognize all
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of microbial components to
provide this fundamental basal defense
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon perception of microbial components
plants trigger complicated signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those signaling cascade has been
classified as two tiered.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is ETI and the other one is PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: PTI meaning needed by cell surface
receptor while ETI is mainly through the
[SPEAKER_00]: intracellular receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to present some of our
work in the context of known knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: PTI signaling and demonstrate up to now
how we think those PAMPs are perceived by
[SPEAKER_00]: the receptors, how the signaling were
transduced up to the head counter nucleus
[SPEAKER_00]: to activate immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our well studied PAMP is from
bacteria derived flatulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacteria use this motor engine flatula
to swing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an essential component for bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its major protein consists of flatulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the part of flatulence protein
can be recognized by the host for instance
[SPEAKER_00]: the 22 animal acid peptide corresponding
to a N-terminal region of flatulence could
[SPEAKER_00]: be recognized by adopsis receptor FS2
which encode a leucine-rich repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor-like kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon the flatulence perception,
flatulence perception FS2 protein quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: almost instantaneously associated with
another ROK similar like FS2 called BAC1
[SPEAKER_00]: form a complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recent structure study also demonstrate
both FS2, BAC1 kind of mediating the
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition of bacterial flatulence
trigger downstream signaling events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon the bacterial flatulence
recognition, a series of immune response
[SPEAKER_00]: can be detected by various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the rapid activation of
evolutionary conserved myokinase signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade by this myokinase antibody western
blotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or defense-related immune gene activation
by RT-PCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other redox changes for instance the
reactive oxy-species production as a few
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also later you could observe chylose
deposition which further lignified cell
[SPEAKER_00]: wall to protect the cell from further
infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also prolonged treatment of flatulence
of the flat 22 peptide inhibit the adopsis
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling growth likely caused by
constituted activation of defense
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also pretreatment of this flatulence
of the flat 22 peptide protect the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from the further secondary infection of
the burden's pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one perspective we examined in order to
understand how flatulence trigger immunity
[SPEAKER_00]: is transduced is looking at the
phosphoproteomic dynamics and the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription changes upon flat 22
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two theories after we found one
small kinase originally called
[SPEAKER_00]: botrytis-induced kinase, big one,
which encode a result of cytoplasmic
[SPEAKER_00]: kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be quickly phosphorated by upon flat
22 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: As shown in this western blotting the
bench kind of migrations are delayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later we did a serious experiment to
demonstrate this indeed is a
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation when for instance treating
the sample with phosphatase CIP to the
[SPEAKER_00]: block this band shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indicating this protein is responding
to flat 22 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this small protein although encode a
cytosolic receptor like kinase but it has
[SPEAKER_00]: a punitive mass dilation motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's target to the plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flat 22 receptor FS2 and BAC1 are
also a plasma membrane localized protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further examined whether they can
do physically associate to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a co-immunoprecipitation I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see big one form a complex with
FS2 and BAC1 without the light and
[SPEAKER_00]: perception suggesting they form a
pre-existing complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly upon flat 22 treatment
seems like the big one got released from
[SPEAKER_00]: the FS2 and BAC1 complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both big one, BAC1, and FS2 encodes
kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we further asked whether there are any
phosphorylation events occurs within the
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here shows you actually from Intel kinase
I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see actually BAC1 could strongly
phosphorate big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further mapped the major
phosphorylation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take this side you largely
compromise the phosphorylation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we demonstrate in addition BAC1
phosphorate big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big one also transfer the BAC to BAC1 to
further enhance the kinase activity of
[SPEAKER_00]: BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for plant ROK family has been
classified as certain screening kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along with our identification of
phosphorylation sides of big one,
[SPEAKER_00]: we find actually big one has multiple side
is phosphorylated at the tyrosine side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mutate some tyrosine side and
find one of the tyrosine side is
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly important to mediating the
kinase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For both certain screening activity and
the total kinase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some side is specifically required for
a tyrosine activity not for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: screening kinase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further asked whether those
tyrosine phosphorylation residue are
[SPEAKER_00]: required for big one function in defense
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see mutation of those tyrosine
side no longer able to compliment the BAC1
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant phenotype as the wild type big one
in terms of botrytis infection and the
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting those tyrosine side is
important for BAC1 function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with the recent study for BAC1
actually from Steven groups they
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrate BAC1 also potentially carry
auto tyrosine phosphorylation activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We further find actually big one
phosphorylation tyrosine side is mediated
[SPEAKER_00]: by BAC1 directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this research is suggesting ROK complex
tyrosine phosphorylation maybe is a
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent event rather than previously
predicted mainly mediated by certain
[SPEAKER_00]: screening kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned early, so upon flat 22
perception FS2 from a complex with BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: BAC1 originally was identified as a
brassinolactose hormone Breiman receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: associated kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BAC1 from complex with Breiman play
important role in DR mediated growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our research demonstrate big one small
kinase function as a direct substrate of
[SPEAKER_00]: BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then recent study also demonstrate there
is an extensive cross talk between BR
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling and FS2 signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the mechanism is still not clear
we know the BR mediated signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: activation unidirectionally suppress the
FS2 signaling at multiple steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we asked what kind of role BAC1
play in DR mediated signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: transduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to our surprise, so BAC1 in contrast as
BAC1 play a negative role in BR signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see this is a typical BR
response I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike BAC1 big one is insensitive even
hyposensitive to BRG which is a BR
[SPEAKER_00]: biophysis inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly in terms of the response to
BAC1 which is a key transcription factor
[SPEAKER_00]: in BR signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the BR signaling is on this
transcription factor is dephosphorylated
[SPEAKER_00]: as shown from the migration shift from the
BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see in big one mutant both the
basal level and upon BL treatment the BAC1
[SPEAKER_00]: dephosphorylated form increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this also I mean consistent with this
BRG treatment result big one mutant has
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated BR signaling going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly the BL suppressed gene is
further suppressed in the BAC1 mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further across the BAC1 to the BR
mutant you can see BAC1 elevated the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth defect of BR receptor phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetically suggests indeed BAC1 play
roles and function downstream of BR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further explored potential
mechanism why BAC1 plays such kind of role
[SPEAKER_00]: in BR signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar as FS2 and BAC1 also encode LR
of receptor line kinase and sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plus membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the co-IP I see you could see big one
also associated with BAC1 from a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-existing complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly upon BL treatment big one
also is released from BAC1 complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is strikingly similar as the complex
dynamics of big one with FS2 in PTI
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although big one play different role in
PTI is a positive regulator but in BL
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway is a negative regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this beef I see further confirm the
association of big one and the bright one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know bright one is a strong
kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask whether there are any
trans-phosphorylation events between
[SPEAKER_00]: bright one and big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from the initial kinase I
see actually bright one strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated big one even stronger than
phosphorylation towards BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the initial study for bright one
and BAC1 phosphorylation mediating the BR
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then interestingly upon BL treatment
it seems like a bright one phosphorylation
[SPEAKER_00]: towards big one is further enhanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting upon BL treatment there is
an enhancement of bright one
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation towards big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further ask the consequence of the
phosphorylation between these two
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here neither the big one
kinase mutant or bright one kinase mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: which both of them lost kinase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see they still form complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big one kinase mutant still form
complex with bright one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing for bright one kinase
mutant with big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: However they no longer released from the
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like the complex become very
tight if there is no phosphorylation
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting the phosphorylation between
bright one and big one maybe is required
[SPEAKER_00]: for disassociation of big one from the
bright one complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through this research we demonstrate
that this big one play negative role in BR
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling through directly phosphorylation
of bright one towards big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow negatively regulate BR media
development and growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: However big one directly phosphorylated by
bright one mediating positively regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: the PTI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still don't know exactly how this
distinct very likely is distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation coming from bright one
dictating such kind of different outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are mapping the differential
phosphorylation for big one through
[SPEAKER_00]: upstream of kinase to further address this
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another perspective we explore FS2
signaling is based on the observation
[SPEAKER_00]: actually big one as I said form a complex
with FS2 also form complex with bright
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recent several years we found actually big
one also is required for additional
[SPEAKER_00]: argument needed responses including big
one form direct complex with EFR which
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the bacteria EFPU and also form
a complex with damp receptor type R1 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are thinking so any component
associated with big one potentially can
[SPEAKER_00]: serve as convergent point to further
mediating the PTI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look for the big one associated
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this line of research one particular
protein we focus is the plant U box
[SPEAKER_00]: containing E3 ligase called POP.
[SPEAKER_00]: A particular POP 12 and 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the E2 hybrid big one and
POP 13 directly interact as so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: co-IP I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unlike the so the big one and POP 13
interaction is constitutive without ligand
[SPEAKER_00]: already form a complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: However seems like the POP 13 associated
with FS2 only upon the ligand perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this complex formation occurs
extremely fast as early as couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds we could see by co-IP experiment
FS2 POP 13 form a complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this data suggest maybe this POP E3
ligase associated with big one upon ligand
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of FS2 so somehow they quickly
form a complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the POP in closer E3 ligase we ask
why this E3 ligase does anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the component in the complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We performed a virtual ubiquitination I
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our surprise the POP 13 directly
ubiquitinated the flight 22 flatulence
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor FS2 as you can see from this gel
the ladder formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However it did not ubiquitinate the
co-receptor backbone or big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this may also suggest the signaling
specificity as this one is the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor for flatulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other can do more polytrophic role in
multiple signaling events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know ubiquitination of protein
can be did either for protein degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: or send the protein for cycling to
activate the signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further ask what's the consequence
of this E3 ligase immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you can see with prolonged flight 22
treatment that receptor FS2 underwent the
[SPEAKER_00]: degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However in the POP mutant that
particularly in the double mutant such
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of degradation is largely reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting genetically I mean providing
genetic evidence POP 13 immediate
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitination on FS2 likely is mediating
FS2 degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genetic analysis of POP mutant further
suggest I mean support our hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in the POP mutant the flight
22 induced the panel's deportation is
[SPEAKER_00]: further elevated compared with Y-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar for disease resistance the POP
mutant is more resistant compared with
Y-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting POP play a negative role in
TPI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this POP protein encode modular
protein so has N-terminal uncarburized but
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant specific domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle is the U-box domain
and then C-terminal has an armadillo
[SPEAKER_00]: repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further did a serious deletion
mutational analysis to narrow down
[SPEAKER_00]: actually this armadillo repeat is
mediating the specific interaction
[SPEAKER_00]: directly interaction with BAC1 and also
phosphorylation mainly occurs on the
[SPEAKER_00]: armadillo repeat by BAC1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ubiquitination towards the
substrate FS2 mainly mediated by the U-box
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we hypothesize whether we by
generating the armadillo repeat domain
[SPEAKER_00]: alone will generate a dominant negative
worsen of this E3 ligase will block the
[SPEAKER_00]: assess of the substrate for the generate
the dominant negative worsen of the POPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generate the transition plans of all
expression the arm domain alone are
[SPEAKER_00]: transition plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see these transition plans behave
similar as the POP mutant particular is
[SPEAKER_00]: raised to the similar level as the double
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the transition plans become more
resistance to bacterial pest infection and
[SPEAKER_00]: the loss production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can see from the myokinase
activation the POP single mutant or the
[SPEAKER_00]: double mutant show more myokinase
activation compared with Y-type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the transition plans is similar
as the POP double mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting this POP all expression arm
domain alone could provide a dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do this is it's a challenge
to study the individual function of the
[SPEAKER_00]: POP because of the redundancy this is a
large gene family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing such kind of dominant negative
thing we wish we could further elucidate
[SPEAKER_00]: additional members of POP gene families
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: In immunity and other process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this line of research it seems
like once the defense response is
[SPEAKER_00]: activated the cell has a mechanism by
recruiting the E3 ligase into the receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: complex and then quickly degrade the
receptor to down regulate the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it is no longer needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep the defense response tightly
under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this again equals a famous saying I
learned from elementary school from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no instance for any country
benefiting from a constant defense
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the right time we should stop such
kind of things to benefit the society in
[SPEAKER_00]: the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop the war we should get support from
government for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meanwhile I also view this line of
research although we and the plans look
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter at elementary school knows you
are fit doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you work at the House General
Hospital you are not a true doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work with plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm trying to tell her what I do is
really important for real doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you see what I found is marvelous
similar as what happened to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as human and plans we all use similar
type of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those receptor I mean receptor protein C
on the plus membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our boxes use this FS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you may use TR4 for LPS,
TR5 for flatulence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the downstream for activation of
the signaling cascade for human we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the Iraq site of kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the similar type of kinase big
one, black one transduce the FS2
[SPEAKER_00]: signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we further found that the E3
ligase monitor the defense and latitude by
[SPEAKER_00]: E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working on this receptor part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similarly in human we have TR3A
exactly same looking E3 ligase work on
[SPEAKER_00]: this TR4 to monitor the defense response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in addition in human there are another
type of E3 ligase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And monitor this Iraq kinase to find the
immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently we found actually there are
similar type of E3 ligase also working at
[SPEAKER_00]: this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell her how important we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is we are taking the proteomic
approach to look at genome-wide level.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the ubiquitination potentially
regulating the PTI response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is to purify the
ubiquitination associated protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do an aspect and to identify such
kind of protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: To our surprise out of our list from the
receptor to RCK to the kinase level to the
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are known component on our list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at multiple levels defense response are
tightly checked by such kind of mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: shared in human.
[SPEAKER_00]: While in the process particular
interesting for this protein you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gel as long as you can see signal
indicating ubiquitination events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this protein is
specifically induced upon like 22
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in the process to further
characterizing what's the E3 ligase
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the consequence to monitor this
protein for ubiquitination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another approach we took to understand
the PTI signaling is the classical genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to looking for additional
component involving PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the philosophy is we use the early PTI
marker gene as a radar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we choose IFRK1 so called which in
code of lightning induced the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gene can be induced by flight
control very rapidly within 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we call the promoter who cover with the
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically these transgenic plants if
you treat the plants with flatulence or
[SPEAKER_00]: non-pathogenic or non-hosted bacteria
these plants light up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we mutinize these plants and then
looking for mutants either hypersensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: or non-responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking for mutants we name those
mutant as our doses gene governing immune
[SPEAKER_00]: gene expression as Iggy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know our logo is Iggy so this attract
a lot of undergraduate students and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of free labor to do the initial squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out it's a fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first six mutant right now we are
characterizing and are coming from one REU
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fruitful screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one mutant I share with you sort of we
kind of understand how this mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: causes such kind of phenotype is Iggy1.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Iggy1 actually we have two
alleles later with my best clone both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them and finally mutated at the same gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I show both of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean both together you can see that
Iggy1-1 or Iggy1-2 the response are much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this mutant in respond not only
to Fleck-22 but also other plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance here Earth-18 or non-pathogenic
or non-hosted pathogen suggesting the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation not only I mean very likely it's
not affecting the receptors it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: happening all downstream because we know
different plants likely perceived by
[SPEAKER_00]: different receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also perform the RNA-seq analysis and
seems like the Iggy1 mutant has further
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced Fleck-22 induced gene
transcription changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this mutant also show enhanced disease
resistance to burdens bacteria and also
[SPEAKER_00]: striking this mutant is extremely
resistant to party-new-do fungi or fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why were this mutant show an altered
Fleck-22 media myokinase activation?
[SPEAKER_00]: The raw production also seems like a
similar as wild type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting the mutation occurs either
downstream or independent of myokinase
[SPEAKER_00]: activation or loss-burst process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we further perform map-based cloning
and clone this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually Iggy1-1 imposed CPL3 which is a
putative CTD phosphatase like protein 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the CTD?
[SPEAKER_00]: CTD is the RNA polymer 2C carboxy terminal
domain it's a RNA polymer 2 C terminal
[SPEAKER_00]: domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know RNA polymer 2 is an essential
component regulating all the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this RNA polymer 2, the C terminal
domain, consists of various repeats of
[SPEAKER_00]: conjured peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in different organism this repeats
number of variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Arbutus, there are 32 and 34 depends on
how you classify these repeats in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in humans, it seems like with small
complicated organism the repeats number
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each individual repeats consists this
very conserved seven animal acid peptide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among these seven, five of them could
be phosphatated consisting serine and
[SPEAKER_00]: tyrosine and the serine residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through many arrogant research in East,
we know the way of phosphorylation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dynamic phosphorylation process on
this individual residue, on these multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: repeats, orchestrate the transcription
process through the initiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: elongation and termination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mutant encodes our phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In East, the corresponding homolog in East
has been shown to dephosphorylate certain
[SPEAKER_00]: residues of these haptop repeats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we've asked, we examined whether
there are any response for RNA polymer 2
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of RNA polymer 2 treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prolonged the C terminal domain of
polymer 2 and put it in the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see strikingly, there was no
conflict between the two treatment as
[SPEAKER_00]: early as two minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this CTD, RNA polymer 2 C terminal
domain show rapid mobility shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later we did more work demonstrate this
mobility shift is a phosphorylation
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here this gel is using the
phospho-serine, ser2, ser5, ser7 antibody
[SPEAKER_00]: to detect the endogenous RNA polymer 2
phosphorylation status.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see up on flat 22 treatment,
this virus residue responding to flat 22
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment got active phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further asked what kind of kinase
acting upstream to activate the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation of polymer 2 CTD domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in East, we know the second independent
protein kinase committed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation activation of the CTD,
in particular for the CDKC8 family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're looking for the
corresponding homolog in our blopses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so which is the closest number is
CDKC1 and 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to our surprise for CDKC,
particularly for CDKC1, up on flat 22
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment itself is so migration shift
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later we did more work and demonstrate
this again is a phosphorylation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indicating the CDKC1 is responding to
flat 22, it's activated up on flat 22
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further asked what's the upstream
of kinase regulating the CDKC activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know in the PTR signaling, right below
the PRR complex is the convergent
[SPEAKER_00]: myopinase cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: We explore whether myopinase play an
important role in activating of the CDKC
[SPEAKER_00]: cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use the myopinase specific
inhibitor or the myopinase phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see this inhibitor or the
phosphatase largely reduce the activation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the CDKC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So suggesting maybe a myopinase cascade
working upstream of CDKC activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that in our blopses the PTI
signaling, myopinase 3,6 for an 11 play
[SPEAKER_00]: important role in PTI pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further test which specific
myopinase activated CDKC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here from this immunocomplex kinase I say
you could see myopinase 3 could directly
[SPEAKER_00]: activate the CDKC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile we also see myopinase 3 also
activated the CDKC2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we further performed my spectra
analysis and identified the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation site of CDKC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see mutate this
phosphorylation site, you wipe out the
[SPEAKER_00]: myopinase activation towards CDKC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, the mutant will isolate in
cause of phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a putative phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only in yeast it has been solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a functional phosphatase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we further demonstrate actually the
one in our blopses genome also indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: carry a phosphatase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here shows you when you have the
catalytic motif of the phosphatase,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put wipe out the phosphatation of CTD
activated by CDKC upstream kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking this together we demonstrate
sort of genetic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find actually downstream myopinase
there is a CDKC complex could directly
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated by the myopinase cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is CDKC directly
phosphorylated myopinase 2 C-terminate
[SPEAKER_00]: domain to activate the pow2 transcription
alters treating the immune related gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this phosphatase we isolated from
the genetic screen could dephosphorylate
[SPEAKER_00]: the pow2 C-terminate domain to counter
regulate the pow2 activation on the immune
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent a few minutes to explain a
little bit from my domestic project on
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton after I moved on to Texas,
which is the largest acre of growth for
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cotton, why I don't raise, I mean,
initially I check cotton as a crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool crop, all smiling face with
cotton fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody love cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you use cotton research to a
similar type of research, you'll come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with these two things everybody said,
because it's a very difficult and complex
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see treatment long growth cycle and
difficult for transformation only a few
[SPEAKER_00]: part of us is able to be transformed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but meanwhile, it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought we should do something with
cotton with local potential farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we tackle cotton is to develop
a trend in ISIS, because so far for
[SPEAKER_00]: cotton, most of research focusing on
genome evolution perspective of fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: development process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no, any known margin has been
isolated from cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my base cloning is a pain of neck.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genome is 2.5 KB.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's aloe tetraploidy is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the training I see we did by one
is nozzle function by I've remitted weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see another one is a game of function as
this role per plus space, the trending
[SPEAKER_00]: transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can escape the mechanism for weeks,
but the importantly, the, we found the
[SPEAKER_00]: theory based on virus vector works
perfectly in cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do the, I've remitted
infiltration 10 day old seedling and
[SPEAKER_00]: observed very efficient silencing at the
two weeks post inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So importantly, these weeks works on all
different kind of cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton was so far we tested commercial one
and everything grow in the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this really gave us the power to
potentially explore the arginine things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we got to explore the
knowledge in cotton, what we did is we
[SPEAKER_00]: built the VHS library and then try to
perform similar kind of screen like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people did in tomato and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inoculate the individual agrobacteria
with the individual seedling and then
[SPEAKER_00]: screen for different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can go back to sequence the
agro we used to result which gene cause
[SPEAKER_00]: such kind of phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this work, this going to really
revolutionize the cotton, my base cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: process is long process and so far there
is no any see in cotton yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a, I mean, molecular biologist
also, we are not satisfied with only see
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to understand why this happens,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very important to have a system
allow you to put the gene back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: system to look at what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I adopt a modified procedure for pro
plus system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really allow you to put the
gene back in two days and then you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: all sort of molecular biology to look at
what is the protein behavior and to study
[SPEAKER_00]: the biochemistry part of the gene
function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the center on these two platforms we
developed, we focusing on what we see
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the devastating disease
in the field worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the particular with the V1 and V1,
they all PRR type of like FH2 type of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor like kinase, examining the
signaling transduction in this cascade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more recently, we also doing
collaboration work with Adam for bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: blind, looking for tail targets,
mediating either resistance or
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another perspective is root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root rot is very bad in Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we developing the, we are testing
the root part, so allow us to silence the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene in the root, examine the requirement
mediating root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is the drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I think the drought is,
initially drought is one of the easiest
[SPEAKER_00]: treat to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just do inoculation and stop water and
then go back to root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although I mean, with kind of
successful in terms of isolating two
[SPEAKER_00]: components, although they are in the
non-ABA pathway, but there is no molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: link, seems like we are building something
quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my kinase serving as direct
substrate of SNRK kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SNRK kinase also kind of directly
phosphorylated my kinase, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something we don't know in the previous
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these two pathways work independently
in the downstream of dehydration pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to figure out the exact
mechanism why we saw they are connected,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetically also independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So share a little bit the preliminary
result we did together with Adam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really fun project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the tail effect, actually for
cotton bacteria bright, it's a seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through many years of research,
we know that the main pathogenicity factor
[SPEAKER_00]: is mediated by type three factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And among those type three factors,
a larger group are tail effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that tail effector function
like a transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It carry the nucleoligation activation
domain and also has a unique binding
[SPEAKER_00]: specificity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those repeat, dictating the recognition
specificity of the host target sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through Adam's research, we know that
we can potentially predict the recognition
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the individual tail effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we choose two typical such kind of
tail effector.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is AVRB6, which in cotton bacteria,
is one of the most characterized in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the corresponding resistance loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another one is PTHN, it's the major
virulence determined in sense motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we clone those individual tail
effectors, express them in the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: pro-plast cell, and then perform the
transcriptome analysis of up-regulated or
[SPEAKER_00]: down-regulated genes by these two tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then working together with Adam's to
predict the potential target gene among
[SPEAKER_00]: those outer expression transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we further confirm those
transcription changes and then perform a
[SPEAKER_00]: serious experiment in terms of the
transactivation assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also next step is to perform last
scale kind of for VIGS assay, all detail
[SPEAKER_00]: assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: To examine the requirement of those
candidate gene mediating AVRB6-mediated HR
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance and PTHN-mediated
susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully through this, we can provide
information what kind of host target
[SPEAKER_00]: mediated by this AVR or PTH effectors from
sense motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I would like to thank folks
that work in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also wonderful collaborators,
a lot of bioinformatics work together with
[SPEAKER_00]: John-Ting Fei here at the BTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam, of course, and several other
people in various institutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are founding agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to give such long talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm supposed to stop five minutes early.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm happy to take any questions if
you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
