[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you have not accidentally wandered
into an entomology talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually a horticulture talk,
but because it's an insect that affects a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of potential plants, it's something
that I thought people would be of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: to the horticulture seminar group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, and Nina noticed, I actually do have
a doorstep on my, a picture of a doorstep,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we'll get to that and explain it a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to ask you questions to start
out, because, you know, it's lunchtime and
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to keep everybody awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people have already heard of
spotted lanternfly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you are from Pennsylvania?
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's a start.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, are there spotted lanternfly
populations in New York State at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we have some yeses and some noes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, we'll cover that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the host range?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can shout out anything that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good answer so far,
as far as we know so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything we should be doing
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's always a good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost always yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be doing something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is there any good news?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll answer that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I haven't heard about that,
so you could bring that up at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, or is that the answer he gives to
everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't heard of it,
it's spotted lanternfly is a plant hopper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from China and it has moved across
the universe, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And came in, they believe, on stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Egg masses came in on stone brought from
Korea, I think, as far as they understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was introduced to Korea about the same
time it was introduced to the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, which is around 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see it is a beautiful insect if
you happen to like insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, do I have a pointer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops, that's always a bad thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't do that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I want you to note,
though, is the size markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see, it's not the actual size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not this big, but it is half an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to pass these around.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not great, but they at least
show you how big the insect is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the adults about an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice them when they fly into you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty big and they do fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good hoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're plant hoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
it, but you'll see this kind of picture
[SPEAKER_01]: gets put out a lot, because one of the
things we're most interested in is that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking for it and identifying
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it does occur in New York State,
we'll know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the answer to that first
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there spotted lanternfly populations
in New York State?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the moment, as far as we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, scientists, we have to qualify
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no existing populations in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at all these orange spots,
those are all times that it has been
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Monroe County, they found at
least 37 in an order of Christmas trees
[SPEAKER_01]: that were brought up from Pennsylvania,
cut Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was first identified actually in
Dutchess County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in a pharmacological warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody noticed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first time they found it in
New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was introduced right around here in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has spread since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's spreading, it's continuing to
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I go and look for this map,
which the current map is on the New York
[SPEAKER_01]: State Integrated Pest Management website,
I have to keep making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes up more space, because it keeps
adding more states for locations,
[SPEAKER_01]: either where it's existing populations,
blue or yellow, where they found it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not a population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing to me that's absolutely
amazing, it is not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no known populations yet in New
York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone assumed that we would get it
last summer, that we would have it last
[SPEAKER_01]: summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that say to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Winter happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're right that the winters are
cold enough to kill the adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not cold enough to kill the egg
masts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it means to me is we've done a good
job of keeping an eye out for it and
[SPEAKER_01]: preventing it from coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Pennsylvania is doing a ton of work and
are very generous in sharing things with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not yet in New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should we talk about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Start looking at the numbers and losses
from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give you an indication of why we'd
like to keep it out as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also be ready for it when it gets
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ag Department, so $18 million in
plant-based commodities in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't include homeowner business
tourism losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania has added $3 billion to their
state budget to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, I think, four full-time hotline
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: To answer calls when people call that they
are reporting it or that they want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: if they found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have the problem that people are
calling 911.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have ads out that say,
please don't call 911 for spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have a lot of, you can get
spotted lanternfly earrings, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: socks, welcome hats, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a beautiful example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things is why is it such a
problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to kill with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little hard to catch them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good jumpers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this picture give you any idea why
they might be hard to kill?
[SPEAKER_01]: The egg masses in particular are hard to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adults are pretty easy to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It occurs in huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen insects that mass like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would seem contraindicated in that
they're all sharing the same flow source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all competing with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are very happy together,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's one thing that you notice from
this picture with apple trees in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The tree looks fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are still okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really looks fine?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't feed on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed in the woody tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're feeding in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're sap suckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really, look at this picture,
they're kind of benevolent.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not actually their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their eyes are up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the orange spots make them look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at the mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you can see with the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mouth parts go right into the
twig.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this twig is a lot woodier than you're
going to see usual plant hoppers feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're strong enough to get their mouth
parts into that woody tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they tap into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't actually have very much of a
suction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just kind of sort of moves through
them pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moving through is another issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'd known about it, I would have
tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they produce a huge amount of honeydew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at this bottom step,
that's the one they've cleaned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two still have the honeydew on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about that number of
insects in a tree, you can imagine that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of honeydew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can make this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have swarm feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're not really feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not actually attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ones that aren't moving much that
are plugged in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this one up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some where you can see their mouth
parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the honeydew squirting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a spork bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking amounts,
and that's just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that mass of them there, I mean,
underneath, it's just going to be some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get sooty mold developing in
the honeydew, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can actually help kill some plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a vineyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pennsylvania, and you can see the vines
here don't look very happy and are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what they think is the feeding
on the plants affected them enough that
[SPEAKER_01]: then they were winter killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't that the insects directly
killed them, but they led to their demise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they move from feeding site to feeding
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this looks like I've photoshopped a
spotted lanternfly in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, it's a clip from a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those things that look kind of
like birds are actually spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: lanternflies moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're moving either into or out of
this apple orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can move itself around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also isn't very fussy where it lays
eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, from the point of view of
development of an insect, it seems very
[SPEAKER_01]: odd to put your eggs on something they
can't feed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they like rusty metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is at the bottom of a planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your great aunt Agatha gave you a
planter to take back from Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't necessarily think that that's
something you needed to remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cover their eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's egg masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs are laid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cover them with kind of this
muddy substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it dries and turns darker brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very much like bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's somebody scraping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they lay them on anything that's
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they lay a lot of egg masses all at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other spotted lanternflies seem to lay
them, again, in the same location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really good hitchhiker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you see the numbers here on this
tire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at least on the tire, many of them
will be run over, but not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do everything in a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not great individualists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing everything together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got numbers like that,
trying to make sure that you've cleaned
[SPEAKER_01]: them all off a vehicle before it goes
anywhere is tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about this location,
here's Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the transportation that goes
through Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it comes north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes into New York State.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually is another clip from a
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a spotted lanternfly on a
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the train.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about the kind of area
around train tracks, nobody's managing it
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was going pretty slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be easy enough for a spotted
lanternfly adult to hop on and find a
[SPEAKER_01]: place where it didn't get blown off and
move.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the reason I said in boats,
too, is there was a boat that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Philadelphia Harbor into New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was quarantined before it was
allowed to land, to dock, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: found spotted lanternfly on the boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had to clean it up before they
would let it dock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can come in lots of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy for it to hide in places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the Christmas trees,
what we think is they actually liked the
[SPEAKER_01]: adults were all dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they seemed to crawl into the
wrapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they also seemed to like to be in sort
of tight places, which also makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So OK, are you all scared now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason, too, why we believe it
is definitely coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's about the host range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is what we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I see a list, it's got more
things on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, it was mostly trees and shrubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're seeing things like basil and
cucumbers and soybeans and status.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots and lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also this difference between
what it's feeding on and what it's laying
[SPEAKER_01]: its eggs on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lays its eggs on lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have had one case of an egg mass
coming in on nursery stock into Long
[SPEAKER_01]: Island, as well as we've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we've had other cases of things
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that I've heard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the Christmas trees, you don't see
anything that's what we use as Christmas
[SPEAKER_01]: trees on this host range list.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will lay its eggs on Christmas tree
bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing we're worried about,
because who's looking for the egg masses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully the growers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you have them, you bring it in
your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it would be an advantage if the
egg mass would hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would freak people out and we'd hear
screaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's happened yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, you keep it in your
house a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you throw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've got an egg mass that's sitting
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs aren't killed by the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will hatch out at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the feeding versus egg laying has some
importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both for moving it around and then also
for the damage that's likely to cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even where maples are one of the more
or less preferred hosts, part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem is not that they're feeding on the
maple, but that they're dropping honeydew
[SPEAKER_01]: down below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in landscape settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know a little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tree of Heaven is a preferred host,
as it showed before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's a required host.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also think that's the reason that
things don't eat them, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: acquire a toxin from feeding on Tree of
Heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you saw the picture of the insect,
I'm going to give you an entomology quiz
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the one thing about the picture of
the insect which might let you believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't taste good?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tree of Heaven, they seem to be on any
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape, they seem to be on any time,
both wild and cultivated grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a preference for fourth
instar through adult for the Tree of
[SPEAKER_01]: Heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it the one advantage on that
is that you can use Tree of Heaven as a
[SPEAKER_01]: place to both scout and potentially treat
the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seeing that they sort of move
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on some things like rose, you find the
nymphs, but you don't see the adults
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there seems to be some preference for
the late season adults for things like
[SPEAKER_01]: silver maple and willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, everything that we know,
we know a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may find out more information.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, in Pennsylvania, they're doing
a lot of research on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing quite so much here,
because we don't have it, and we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to bring it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some research that's going on in
New York state, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what should we be doing about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn to identify it is the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of why I'm doing this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, OK, many of you had heard about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you have been able to identify it
before I gave the talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some nodding, and we've got some
no's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least there's a reason to do this
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning to identify it and looking for
it is one thing that we can be doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the life stages, they're big and
they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that maybe helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the egg masses that I think are
the hard part to find, just because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're meant to be cryptic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I think I showed this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the eggs, and then they get
covered with the mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mud often turns kind of
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't find all stages all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the life cycle has some importance in
terms of identifying it and looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: it, to know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eggs are there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually start laying eggs in
September, and they can be there all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an advantage there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you've got a long time to find
them before they start hatching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get the first instars hatching
out in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't get fourth instars in the
adults until later in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the adults, it shows that it says
July to December.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are killed by the cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's warm enough, they will stick
around that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is based on Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be similar to what we
would see here, we think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always just enough difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the good no's points that
I'll get to at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what to look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honeydew, wasps and bees feeding on the
honeydew, the black city mold on the
[SPEAKER_01]: honeydew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see, this is a terrible
slide, but there's a group of spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: lanternfly here in this trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see that it's weeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, again, will help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get flagging on the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, we can get flagging on
branches for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to go look to make sure that
this flagging is actually caused by
[SPEAKER_01]: spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, it sounds very loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, I'm not blasting any of you
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for information on
identification or lots of other pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: New York State IPM has a lot on our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the partners in New York
State's plan of attack for spotted
[SPEAKER_01]: lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I said, the most current map is
always on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time something comes up, it usually
gets added here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we create some of it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nys.ipm.cornell.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, nysipm.cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: No extra dot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that we can learn to do is
identify Tree of Heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people can identify Tree of
Heaven?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to see that at least one row
should be able to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many do we have some in the Botanic
Gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Undoubtedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many, many places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things to look for when
the seeds are on, it's pretty easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a compound leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some other things that look
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But very few things have this little node
on the bottom of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also reported to smell like rancid
peanut butter, rancid other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out walking around and you
smell feet, look for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is stinking tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stinking tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing is to identify where
they are and then actually mapping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can get rid of them,
that's a good thing, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is a nice specimen tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to not very likely go out
there and cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one you may not take out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a more wild area or woody
edges, you might actually try and remove
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are fairly hard to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just cut them down because
you'll have more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do what they call the hack and
squirt method, where you cut into
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially just under the bark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you apply the herbicide there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will kill the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're only going to kill one,
kill a female, it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's because they're producing
seeds, and they're very good invasive,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will grow more trees from seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get rid of the females,
even if you leave the males, that's still
[SPEAKER_01]: an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then anything that's left is used as a
place to scout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because they have to be there,
and especially when the adults are out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go look at those trees or actually
put sticky traps on those trees to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're finding any spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when they found it, when we've had
areas where they found some, they do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of this around the areas, is go scout the
tree of heaven and do other things to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that there is not a population.
[SPEAKER_04]: Betsy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're suggesting that we just take out
the lampest so that we don't have to deal
[SPEAKER_04]: with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to get rid of the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they tend to be an attractive
thing where it'll pull them in,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually using them as trap trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep some and get rid of the
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, it makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could treat the ones that are left
with a systemic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to work on controlling
spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good way to get the control with
using the least amount of pesticide also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, if you can get rid of
some of them so that you're not having to
[SPEAKER_01]: scout all of them, that also helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one thing to say that when we
don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, I'll wait till they get
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's fairly certain that if you have
that tree, you're going to get that one
[SPEAKER_05]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, they are preferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to have to feed on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I say that as far as we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for example, if you have them,
they come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's maples around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're happy on the maples.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not immediately move to the tree
of heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is in terms of a place that they
seem to require feeding there that they
[SPEAKER_01]: will eventually end up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you find anything that you think
might be spotted lanternfly, even if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not quite sure and you might be
wrong, still, scrape eggs into the hand
[SPEAKER_01]: sanitizer alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can catch the other stages,
put them in alcohol or freeze them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nymphs and the fourth instars just
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a little bit easier to catch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty fast, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can send pictures and the
location information to spottedlanternfly
[SPEAKER_01]: at agriculture.NewYork.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the older information says DEC,
because DEC was originally the spot to
[SPEAKER_01]: send them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's the Department of Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we also have an external
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's a quarantine?
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, it has to do with tour boats.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we have an external
quarantine because we don't have them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have is a quarantine that's
limiting access to movement of things from
[SPEAKER_01]: someplace into New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere that has a red line around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some places that they know they
have populations that are not yet in our
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is, but most of Pennsylvania,
most of the other sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some of these areas in New Jersey
that we're kind of worried about because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pretty close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they've maybe found some even
closer to New York there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it's an external quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you have to consider
what's moving through that area,
[SPEAKER_01]: any of those areas, into New York state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you know where it is if you're
in Pennsylvania?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the Pennsylvania Department of
Agriculture has this website.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you Google them and put it in a spot
with Landron flying quarantine,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a button for an interactive map.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put in an address, and it will pop
up whether or not it's in the quarantine
[SPEAKER_01]: zone or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, well, that seems like kind
of overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can bring them back from being on
vacation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually Brian Eshenar's
parents' house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a commercial business and
you're bringing anything in, not just if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing the trucking, but if anything
is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this Christmas tree issue is
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're bringing in anything,
the regulated articles include all plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and plant parts, any stage of the insect,
and anything reasonably believed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: infested with or harboring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like anything that might be sitting
outside, vehicles, everything else,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all plant parts, and any kind of any
stage of the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very broad quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes in quarantines, we say,
you can't bring this fruit in,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can't bring this plant in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we did this, we would actually stop all
commerce because essentially anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's outside, it could be on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of saying you can't bring it,
if you have any of those articles,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to have a certificate of
inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a weigh bill with where
it originated and where it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the companies that you're buying from
are supposed to provide those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you should know something about
how it was shipped and loaded and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there's the link for the
Department of Ag and Markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of information on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of information on this
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so this is an issue that does affect
New York growers and other people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've already had a call from somebody
growing blueberries who wanted to know if
[SPEAKER_01]: it was OK to bring in blueberry plants
from Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, certainly, just inspect
them, make sure that they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get them from Maine now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a small example, but I suspect
that means that we are seeing economic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects, and we'll see more as they come
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the DOT inspection spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can see that, they're stopping
trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're stopping vehicles along the roads
coming in from Pennsylvania and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: inspecting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have spotted lantern fly sniffing
dogs also, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a personal trip, the thing is,
if you're going to be driving through the
[SPEAKER_01]: quarantine zone, don't stop if you don't
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, check your vehicle inside and
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to get inside cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know someone was scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the scout that was writing an
article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, yep, they stopped at the
gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just about to go into
Maryland before it was in Maryland and
[SPEAKER_01]: just looked in their trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one had climbed in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, for some reason, like to go
visiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're moving anything that's been
left outside, inspect it, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: the egg masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're starting to put out,
again, documents like this, looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and plant parts, but looking at
packing material, looking at landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, looking at anything that's been
left outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, even if you're a public
citizen, but you happen to go in and out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Pennsylvania a lot, you can get a
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy online training to get
the permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, people from Pennsylvania were
speaking for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, yeah, they had to make so
many that they don't even have nice
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic ones now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were so many that the people
were requesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we ready in New York State?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are as ready as we can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually created something called an
Incident Command Group, just like for
[SPEAKER_01]: battles, where they brought in all these
collaborators, Ag and Markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: DEC, Parks, IPM, and other people to say,
all right, what do you need to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's doing what piece?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we need to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this concept of protective
zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they found any stage, they will make a
protective zone around it and check very
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily to see if there are any
populations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the checkpoints on the roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually do have lists of two double E
lists of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: The labels are already ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not out yet, because we don't have
the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as the insect is determined to
be here, then those will become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to wait, because it often
takes a little bit of time to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: special needs permit for a label for a
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way, they're already ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are looking at those for
secondary effects on pollinators,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're trying not to cause harm in
the process of causing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're looking at this concept of
training for management methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some handouts up here that are from
Pennsylvania that have a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: information on how to manage them and how
to look for them and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if anyone's interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bumper stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of swag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania is doing, as I said,
a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sharing all of it,
which is very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of their management
calendars that they've created.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also doing research on a lot
of the different things, not just
[SPEAKER_01]: management methods, but biology and
movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the effects on different hosts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Insecticide trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there pheromones that we create traps
to make it easier to catch them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever get a chance to hear groups
from Pennsylvania speak, they have just
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing amounts of work that they're doing
and really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there good news?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't sting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not structural pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not here yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all points of good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some things that will eat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you look at the numbers,
it's very unlikely that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good biological control for that
many insects in one place have something
[SPEAKER_01]: eat them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some that are being fed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone that's gone, I suspect that
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not laying eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some biological control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found that the egg parasitoid for
gypsy moth actually was found infesting
[SPEAKER_01]: spotted lanternfly eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got two additional ones from
China that are in quarantine for potential
[SPEAKER_01]: release.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's something about these egg
masses that you notice that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, tell if you've been paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they lay eggs in rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they lay them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they're covered with mud,
they're less likely to be attacked by an
[SPEAKER_01]: egg parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little wasp that lays its egg
inside the egg of the spotted lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't always get them all covered,
but most of them are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that has some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found, I think, levels of maybe
20% infestation, but not enough to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you good control.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are my favorite though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So has there been a study of the
biological process by which these
[SPEAKER_05]: lanternflies create this muddy excretion?
[SPEAKER_05]: Has there been an analysis of the chemical
composition of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I know, but that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was asking if there's been any study of
the mud and the chemical composition of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whether or not that's actually
repelling the insects or it's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: physical process that they can't lay an
egg through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of that is up for grabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's research also going on in
Korea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in China, they're under control
because they've got the natural enemies
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, this is some of the work
that's being done at Cornell is on the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological or entomopathogenic fungi,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see a nicely fuzzy adult there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's infected with a fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I know about Bavaria
bassiana, because it is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: entomopathogenic fungi, this is one of the
entomopathic pathogens that we use in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's currently being produced
commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually buy it and apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some insects, they shed their skins too
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they kind of slough it off so
they're not infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has got a long period of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's one where it actually
can be controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get some killing of the insect
with the Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just infects the body and kills the
insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is my favorite, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Batcoa major.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's native.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found it being infected in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you notice this one has its wings
outspread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also can maybe see there are
little fungal strands that attach it to
[SPEAKER_01]: that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungus infects the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes it climb up higher than
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's above the population below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes it to open its wings and
attaches it to the plant with these little
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal strands so it doesn't fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a rain of spores falling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty amazing to me that that's
what the fungus can do to the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one, again, looks like that's
native but not commercially available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has some potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually trying spraying
Bavaria bassiana to see if they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: control with the Batcoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to do more work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing that has some potential
good news is the adults will die with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The eggs survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're looking at the concept of
growing degree days.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people know what growing degree
days are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea of you need a certain amount
of temperature to go through the stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: development of the insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's not enough temperature and
not enough heat units, they won't go all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some indication that in parts
of New York State at any rate,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are not enough growing degree days
for the insect to complete its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might halt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have either fewer or no eggs
laid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good sign for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't really know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think up along the lakes is actually
a good place for the insects to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adirondacks, not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even there's some talk that the
southern tier is not so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, we grow a lot of grapes and
apples up around the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of production, that's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's everything that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, Pennsylvania's got some really
entertaining advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gross, effective, necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you can squash them all that
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's a long escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm happy to answer questions if I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be nice to Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to ask Geneva first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Geneva, do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone have questions here?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, now I have to think of another
one for the next time I give a seminar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe everyone will forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did meet Julie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was curious if you're hearing reports
from Pennsylvania about lots of agronomic
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is there indeed lots of agronomic
damage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they had to do lots of pesticides
spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are doing lots of pesticides
spraying, not just for the agronomic
[SPEAKER_01]: damage, but also for the landscape issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where they've seen the most damage
that I've heard, sorry, let me ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: question again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they seen economic damage in
Pennsylvania?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they've seen the most is in grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hops, they keep talking about hops,
but I haven't seen pictures like the one
[SPEAKER_01]: with the grape with a vineyard where you
can actually see the plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the apples, I guess, those apples,
the fruit's not affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were someone harvesting by hand
out in there with that many insects and
[SPEAKER_01]: that much goo around, even if the apples
are fine, you may have to now do washing
[SPEAKER_01]: or other things in terms of getting the
honeydew in the city mold off them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have not seen great information on
other plant damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of it is, again,
to me, if you look at those little,
[SPEAKER_01]: they said you could find them on basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got such big mouth parts,
they'd go right through the stems of
[SPEAKER_01]: basil, you'd think, and they'd probably
suck it dry pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was kind of surprised to see some of
those more herbaceous things on the list.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in addition to the two pathogens that
you showed us, are there other natural
[SPEAKER_04]: predators in the native range of the
insect?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, are there other
predators or other biological control
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms in the native range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two little wasps that they were
bringing in that are under quarantine that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're studying now, those are both from
China and we don't have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, it's not a fast process
then because you have to bring them in and
[SPEAKER_01]: test them on all sorts of things to make
sure that they're not going to feed on
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we actually want or damage
anything else that's native here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that they found the one that
feeds the egg parasitoid of gypsy moth is
[SPEAKER_01]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not related.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so maybe it's a wasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can figure out how to parasitize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whether or not there are other
things like that that they might bring in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard of anything but those two
that they're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had a question back there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the native range, how cold is it
compared to New York?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, in the native range,
how cold is it compared to New York?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the absolute answer on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, I've seen maps where they see
where they think it could survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you're getting up much farther
than New York State, it looks like they've
[SPEAKER_01]: got it as too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it may well be that it's not a
temperature that's killing the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know the absolute temperature
for killing the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought is that it's quite low,
which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to kill the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a somewhat related sense, I mean,
Korea is not that far from China.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why has it only been very recent?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that it's through all of
China.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a map that they have that's at
least the proposed distribution throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so especially if it's moving on
things like stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's trade between the two
places, you would think that that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: an easy way for it to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why it didn't get there until 2014,
or about then too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to go look that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like the native range is more
like Vietnam from what I've read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so maybe it's farther south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know anything about CRISPR and
spotted lanternfly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than the stuff that, no,
not specifically with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's being counted as the general for
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is more of a comment rather than
a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Along highways, there are rest stops and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I were going to have observation posts,
whatever they might be, I'd look at rest
[SPEAKER_06]: stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where they're putting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting them there for the trucks
at the weighing stations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are, very frequently,
I notice tree of heaven growing around
[SPEAKER_06]: freeway exchanges, the bridges and things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would both be maybe a place to
concentrate eradication efforts,
[SPEAKER_06]: although perhaps not in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a tree that grows in
Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also maybe have concentrate scouting
efforts where you have these sequential
[SPEAKER_06]: satellite installations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may well be doing that in
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they're also doing it in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, the concept of, because tree of
heaven is kind of a trash tree in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it ends up and it spreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see a lot of it along roadways and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a program down in Westchester about
the time when the seeds were out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked like everywhere we drove,
all the way along the roads, it's all tree
[SPEAKER_01]: of heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a little bit hard to kill,
that also means that people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's areas where people aren't doing
much management.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can use tree of heaven in the
areas where you think you might see it as
[SPEAKER_01]: it's moving outside of the zone it's in
now, certainly scouting and using those
[SPEAKER_01]: trees as trap trees and places to treat
with pesticide is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also doing a lot of trapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they have sticky traps that
they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found that they actually had to
put cages over them because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: getting other things like birds even stuck
to the sticky trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're trying to make the wire
mesh so that the spotted lanternfly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which actually goes up and down the trunk
to some extent when they're young,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they'll get stuck and other things
won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so you can do the trapping and other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense to do them places where
your vehicles are going to stop and places
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to have tree of heaven to
make it easy on yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the plan for CRISPR to save the
world?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have that conversation afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's longer than it takes now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Nina.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found a lot in urban areas where
there's a lot of Ailanthus, potentially in
[SPEAKER_03]: unmanaged sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's a lot of them for them to
feed on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've heard about the Ailanthus issue
and I just wonder because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be nice if we had very rarely and
they had to be there would make it easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to use that as a management tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they're everywhere and they're
in places that people aren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking, it makes it a little bit harder
to use that as a perfect management tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, and I don't remember exactly
where it was, I saw a video that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: building and there were piles of dead ones
along sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else is nodding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if they even know why
they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just the numbers were amazing and it
was clearly in an urban area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go online, you can find bars that
have competitions for how many you could
[SPEAKER_01]: swat with a splice water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen actually they made beer coasters
and wine coasters that are to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing what spotted lanternfly is and
getting rid of it and contacting the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I say, I found maybe it's a non-welcome
mat with a spotted lanternfly on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get socks with a spotted
lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are making jewelry out of real
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are taking it as taking on the
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think people, if you look at the
house where the steps that were coated and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else, we don't need anything
else that's going to convince people that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want to go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, like if you're standing under a
maple tree, there was someone doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: report and they're standing under a maple
tree and they've got an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized, oh, that's the honeydew
dripping that they're trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another, that whole issue of
homeowners and tourists and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else is I think they're thinking of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've counted what it's
going to cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't bring them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell all my growers, it's like,
you do not want to be the place where they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, this is where the population
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if your plant is not a host,
be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about grapes and lanterns are the
two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so wild grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild grapes, I mean, there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also most of the plants that there
seem to be using are sun loving plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shady areas or sun loving?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Nina's saying is that plants on
the list tend to be sun loving plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not you wouldn't find them in
shady areas as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen anybody talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I say, I think we're still,
even though, I mean, that's six years that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, we're still figuring things
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's even, in terms of the
map, people don't want to have their state
[SPEAKER_01]: put on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they don't want to have their county
put on the map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to even get that.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any role for endopesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Biologically based pesticides?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in systemic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: If these are sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, if there's any role
for systemic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, what they tend to use when
they're using those tree of heaven as trap
[SPEAKER_01]: trees is they're actually using a systemic
insecticide in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the insects feed on it,
they'll die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're looking at
primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, trying to spray something
and get good contact over that number of
[SPEAKER_01]: insects when they move around so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: A systemic is a much better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can use less pesticide and
get more effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have it be really spot treatment and
in a controlled, sort of application,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, from an IPM point of view,
we like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: If they could get a trap that was more
attractive to the insect than the average
[SPEAKER_04]: automobile, they could stick it on the
car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be like the first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make it look like a big spotted
lanternfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was saying, could you get something
that's more attractive than the average
[SPEAKER_01]: car just sitting out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like a screening trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: A trap that if it's not there,
you don't check the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're looking for pheromones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can find something that would
be, even if it's not enough to trap them,
[SPEAKER_01]: to control them, but it's enough to tell
you that they're around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why having something like a
spotted lanternfly sniffing dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did have one situation where the dog
kept pointing it, saying it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did finally find it inside the
grill of the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're well trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so yeah, something like that where
it's a faster means of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because thinking about trying to clean off
every vehicle that's going down the
[SPEAKER_01]: highway, Route 15 into New York,
or 81 into New York, is just almost an
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having something that could check more
easily would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure somebody is working on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks so much, Betsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now I can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
