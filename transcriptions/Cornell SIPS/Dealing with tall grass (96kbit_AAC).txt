[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Frank Rossi for the Cornell
Turfgrass Video Log.
[SPEAKER_00]: This week we're talking about mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in the springtime you get that surge
of growth because we know about 60 to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of all the clippings produced for
the entire season are produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first six weeks of the growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very typical that we're going to
mow more in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for those of you striving for a more
sustainable approach to your lawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're going to cut back on mowing a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is you're left to have
to cut the grass when it's really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course we don't want clippings
clumping up everywhere as that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem from a light shading of the turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be worthwhile to just sort of
scratch them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set the mower as high as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to mow slowly so that you're
distributing the clippings and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly make sure you're mowing when
it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll allow for the clippings to
disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end you may find if you just
skip one mowing per month you're cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: your mowing 25 percent for the entire year
and that can have a real benefit on fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses as well as improving the carbon
emissions in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me for the Cornell
turfgrass video log.

Thank you.
