[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a really interesting conversation
today about something that's literally
[SPEAKER_02]: taken, you know, no commercial people want
to admit it, but commercial people make up
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 15% of all the money spent in
the turf grass industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about homeowners and maybe
they're spending it on commercial services
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little bit more, but the home lawn
market drives the majority of how we value
[SPEAKER_02]: the turf grass industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to talk a little bit about
home lawn stuff today, but we have some
[SPEAKER_02]: guests like I usually like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Fadonza's dog, a previous guest on
the show, is doing well sitting on a
[SPEAKER_02]: chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's Ralphie and Leo from the
Chicago District Office Associations,
[SPEAKER_02]: Derek Settle, who goes out on field tours
with these two knuckleheads.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another passing, Ryan Gordon at
the course at Snoqualmie Ridge up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posted about a dog, his dog he lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is again, just connecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love this dog thing that we've got
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the population has gone up about
20 to 25%, which is a big part of the lawn
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me do the weather call quick,
and then I'm going to set you guys up and
[SPEAKER_02]: get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are warming up quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have really seen a rapid push in warm
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're making sprays for root
pathogens like fairy ring or drenches for
[SPEAKER_02]: summer patch, you're going to be making
those applications relatively quickly in
[SPEAKER_02]: the New York metropolitan area and all the
way up the Hudson Valley and even
[SPEAKER_02]: stretching into here into central New
York.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a dry week last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, I think we had the first
period of time our climatologist told us
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were drying more than we had
rainfall for maybe the first time this
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see the rainfall percentages
are generally 100% or more of normal with
[SPEAKER_02]: a few dry patches smattered throughout the
region, Cape Cod, right around New York
[SPEAKER_02]: City, where it's just a little bit shorter
normal just for the month of April,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has just gotten started.
[SPEAKER_02]: What generally this means is growth is
unabated.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they sometimes say is, listen,
if you're grass doesn't look good this
[SPEAKER_02]: time of year, maybe you should find
another line of work because it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to grow grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you can't stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, Carl, you mentioned you could mow
multiple times in a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mow an area for my wife out at the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mowed it on Sunday, and it needed to be
mowed yesterday on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know growth is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, our little
pollinator risk tool, Carl, is really
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to show up what we're seeing
across the state with regard to dandelion
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a tool that Carl's developed
that's looking at dandelion and clover
[SPEAKER_02]: blooming in the lawn to try to help those
people who might be making applications to
[SPEAKER_02]: their lawns to maybe recognize that
there's risk and potential pollinators
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are with Dr. Sarah Stricka.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah is the outreach coordinator from the
Guelph Turfgrass Institute, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: great turfgrass programs in the world for
many years, and that's widely respected
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the world and, of course,
is the source of information in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sarah's been very outspoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we talked about this on my other
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys have done just a great
job in getting out into the media and
[SPEAKER_02]: being thoughtful about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think your most recent communication
efforts on Twitter with lawn science and
[SPEAKER_02]: just trying to teach people about how
lawns work, what's going on there,
[SPEAKER_02]: citing the science about these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, this is exactly,
you know, we don't want to be defensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though we're like, yeah, I don't
think this is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know,
you want to sort of embrace the idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're thinking about lawns differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, and as I get you in here,
you sent around this iNaturalist
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: About this whole No Mo May thing happening
among eco people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you they're much more
polite than the general public in social
[SPEAKER_02]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big shout out to iNaturalist forum
contributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first time I've ever heard bee
washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you can't fix lawns.
[SPEAKER_02]: No Mo May is a bandaid when lawns need a
tourniquet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just bee washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love this, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think before we get Sarah in here,
just sort of setting up the No Mo May
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, right, Frank?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's May 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show some data here in a bit on
Google searches and how people start
[SPEAKER_01]: searching for No Mo May now instead of in
April, which is a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically the idea is relatively new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess 2019 over in Britain, UK
organization Plantlife started promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a way to promote pollinators in the
lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the idea is you treat your
lawn like a lawn every single month of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year, except for May, in which you just
let it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is that there will be
flowering plants that will grow up as you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't mow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be a pollinator sort of
foraging resource for them early in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season, especially when there's not a
whole lot around.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look through some literature,
this is the thing that sort of pops up
[SPEAKER_01]: when you search it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A paper out of Appleton, Wisconsin,
and they said that, hey, we found No Mo
[SPEAKER_01]: May lawns relative to traditional lawns
have higher pollinator richness and
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea was they sort of survey
pollinators and, oh, wow, we got more in
[SPEAKER_01]: the No Mo May lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of supports the idea that it's
good for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you started to see certain
municipalities, Appleton, Wisconsin,
[SPEAKER_01]: some places in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around here, Frank, we're starting to hear
chatter, especially when it comes to code
[SPEAKER_01]: of cities and towns where normally you're
supposed to keep vegetation lawn type
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation under eight inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're saying, eh, we'll make an
exception for No Mo May because it's good
[SPEAKER_01]: for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with that is that that paper
was retracted a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an entomologist detailed sort of a lot
of reasons why the paper had some
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, how they were identifying
bees by sight and not with a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you would need to identify the
certain species of bees, and also that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were reporting bees that just didn't
exist in Wisconsin during May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some other landscape
context things, reasons why that the paper
[SPEAKER_01]: probably wasn't so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out when you look at some
different papers that have been retracted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you actually see these sort of bee
abundances, how many bees are going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can cut the lawn every two weeks,
even in May, you have more bees than a
[SPEAKER_01]: three week mowing interval.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some evidence there that,
hey, you sort of got to cut the grass so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it doesn't sort of shade out the
dandelion flowers or the clover flowers so
[SPEAKER_01]: the bees can actually see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Sean asked, he's got a
graduate student, Frank, who's looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: UV light, sort of how pollinators see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a No Mo May, which has
really long grass, that basically obscures
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability for the bees to see those
foraging resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, maybe that's actually preventing
them from getting to the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just some evidence,
some pictures from my community where I
[SPEAKER_01]: see a couple of No Mo May lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really just doesn't go well at the
end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the end, you got to cut that grass
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the idea of in June and July,
you're going to treat it like a lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to have some bad
consequences that I've seen handling that
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative material, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you put all those clippings,
which have nitrogen and phosphorus in
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you dispose of those off the lawn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some damage to long-term turf quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll ask Sarah, actually, so you've got
some research there from a No Mo May plot
[SPEAKER_01]: last year you can maybe share with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this idea of the other animals
that sort of inhabit that long vegetation
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout May.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got some small mammals,
some snakes, and then you sort of cut all
[SPEAKER_01]: that down, they were setting up shop all
spring, and then you just shock in one
[SPEAKER_01]: shot and shock event disrupted that entire
habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's not such a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're focused on pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might not be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a perfect time to talk about No
Mo May.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I look at Google Trends the last five
years in New York, No Mo May, you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: first spike in 2021, more interest in
2022, and even more interest last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what we do this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interesting to me, Frank, that the
searches peak in the second week of May,
[SPEAKER_01]: which if I were going to implement No Mo
May, I'd probably want to know before May
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st that I was going to do it,
not sort of like, yeah, well, we're two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks into May.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I mow my lawn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, maybe I don't need to mow my lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this starts to bring in some questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are we dealing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are, I guess, the audience of No Mo
May?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what Sarah's work and
everybody at the Guelph Turfgrass
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute has some really good resources
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No to Mo May.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have set up a lot of cool,
good visuals, so good sort of snippet
[SPEAKER_01]: posters you can send people to.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get some just really basic information
on what's good for pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the stuff in lawns good for
pollinators?
[SPEAKER_01]: How should I treat my lawn if I want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really good communication of the
literature too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have these papers and you sort of
bring out the notes that are key for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really good way to communicate sort of
the primary source literature to average
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are going to start maybe
implementing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that starts to get us to our questions,
right, Frank?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the first question,
Sarah, is who is the audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always, as extension people start
with, who are we trying to communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess in your sort of experience with
people who are looking at No Mo May,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a general profile of people who
want to do this or groups who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: adopt this practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've got a lot of background on
this and I totally support this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get in this, I did, when you
pulled up the paper about the del Toro
[SPEAKER_00]: paper with the beast, they are going to
republish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did do some re-studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a paper that has been
pre-published and it's available online
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they basically redid it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only was the issue that they were
identifying bees incorrectly, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing No Mo lawns to mowed parks,
which are totally different environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: mowed lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even mowed lawns are going to have
more pollinators than a park because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's generally flowers around a lawn,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, that's that's one little
caveat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm finding with No Mo May is
it's mostly homeowners and it's people who
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the spike in that two week
part is because that they're seeing other
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have put the No Mo May signs
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're on their smartphones on the
walk and their dog be like, what does this
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people get really, really upset
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a paper in the Wall
Street Journal that people were citing
[SPEAKER_00]: each other's neighbors and calling in and
people get really, really upset because
[SPEAKER_00]: you said that you're making your
neighborhood look messy or bringing out a
[SPEAKER_00]: property value or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's generally homeowners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because there has been this big
virality of it on social media and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last year, I think also we were
talking to a lot of news media outlets
[SPEAKER_00]: that also could have contributed a bit to
the spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has developed policies in certain
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had to set a rule on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the municipality sets a rule,
then people are going to start to Google
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's homeowners, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's people who want to do a
good thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not they're just missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about people arguing in virality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's normal business in New York state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked a question this morning of
somebody I'm going to ask it of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you separate out people trying to do
good from people who just hate lawns?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I I people who hate lawns hate
them because they want to see more
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anyone you stop on the street and
ask them, is biodiversity a good thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's that's what we've all been
taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people who hate lawns,
they're not really understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: functional space that it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the website that I have
that's lawn science that also talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the functions of lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be lovely in a world that we
could just say, yeah, everybody's lawn can
[SPEAKER_00]: convert to a wildflower meadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then don't call me when your cat goes
missing, because now you have coyotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are there are pest control
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yes, there are studies that fleas
are not fleas and ticks are not really
[SPEAKER_00]: that much more in long grass unless you
live next to forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if you live next to forests,
you're going to have more fleas and ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if we're building multiple
neighborhood corridors of everyone doing
[SPEAKER_00]: long grass, then that's going to create
more larger animals like deer and deer
[SPEAKER_00]: carry ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the studies that exist that say,
oh, no, long grass doesn't actually carry
[SPEAKER_00]: ticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small plot studies and they cannot
be applied to how like it's common sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to say you're going to find more ticks in
long grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Guelph Turfgrass Institute actually
just we moved only about 500 meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: half a kilometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our old location and we stopped mowing
it for four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you walked in there with white
pants, you'd come out with black pants
[SPEAKER_00]: because of how much tick you ticks you
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no forest there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, there's also a home,
a town in Ontario that they had a really
[SPEAKER_00]: great initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good feel good movement where
they said that they were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely naturalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 20 percent of the
landmass of their public parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said they're going to naturalize
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve months, no cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now this year, they had to add three
thousand dollars back into their budget to
[SPEAKER_00]: mow those all down because they have rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rats and snakes and coyotes don't belong
in lawns, Carl.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about pollinators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, Sarah, you're bringing up a lot
of sort of risks of no mow may.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's often billed as this is great for
pollinators, and that's one potential
[SPEAKER_01]: function or ecosystem service of lawns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other things that lawns are
good for, and it's not just recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just aesthetics, but things like
stormwater controls, soil erosion,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, air temperature reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to do no mow may,
maybe there's some health and safety
[SPEAKER_01]: risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just talking to some extension folks
this morning, downstate in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were saying that can be something
that moves people off of no mow may.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about ticks, when you talk
about snakes or mow mice that can get near
[SPEAKER_01]: foundations, then it all of a sudden is,
ooh, is it worth me having pollinators in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lawn for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the next question is,
should we be promoting pollinators in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawns?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there things like dandelion or clover
or self-heal?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, how good are those for
pollinators?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it worth sort of sacrificing some
of our other functions or ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: services of the lawn to get those foraging
sort of edible goals for pollinators in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lawn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, and, you know, we talk about
the obvious pests of the rats and the
[SPEAKER_00]: snakes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about bees, bee stings?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who are literally deathly
allergic to bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, if you were to go back 30
years and say, oh, how much I love bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: people would look at you like,
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was, you know, before the
popularization of the EpiPen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally don't want bees in my
backyard because I like to play with my
[SPEAKER_00]: dog and walk barefoot in my grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want bees there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But pollinators are not just bees either.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are in bees alone, there's over
there's hundreds of species of bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's also moths and birds and
flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to say you're going to
support all of these hundreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly thousands of pollinator species
that exist with one flower, a dandelion,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a not native and maybe not a very
good nutrition source, that doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: right to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the bandaid when you need a
tourniquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need dandelions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need apple species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the flowering dogwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the magnolias.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the willow species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I were to have a let's say a
wedding and I'm having a hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred people over, I'm not just going
to put up one bowl of chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put out a buffet because I
know that not everybody is going to like
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorite flavor of dill pickle chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people won't eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will be allergic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, listen, here's something that I
hear often.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was reiterated in the iNaturalist
thing, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys have been playing around
with this and I think maybe even measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me if I'm wrong there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things I hear is when
people want to help pollinators,
[SPEAKER_02]: they buy plants in the spring and then
they help the pollinators in the summer
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fall, or they buy plants in the
summer and help them in the fall,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they buy them in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, maybe they'll come up in the
spring, but tend to come up in the fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the lawn from your perspective actually
potentially useful for early spring
[SPEAKER_02]: visitors, early spring natives,
specialists?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you say that it's probably best
to delay mowing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than to necessarily, or if you mow,
as the study showed, relax it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these spring ephemerals, I'm
wondering, it can serve a real purpose,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's sort of misaligned in timing,
at least in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like it's become something
mostly because of the alliteration,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, you know, mow,
no shave, November, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it took off on men not shaving in
November and men are lawn people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now it's no mow-may because they
don't shave in November and they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to cut their grass in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a rebellion of the entire male
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you talk a little bit about early
spring stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my neighborhood, at least,
the crocuses have already come and gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I strongly believe, at least in my
ecosystem, and I cannot say a blanket
[SPEAKER_00]: statement through across all of North
America, plant crocuses in your lawn to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide early spring pollen because I
don't know when the crocuses will pop in
[SPEAKER_00]: your neighborhood versus my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for Ontario, Southern Ontario
specifically, you can incorporate crocuses
[SPEAKER_00]: or snow drops into a lawn and they will
flower and complete their entire life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle before you even need to mow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also incorporate white clover and
intercede that white clover actually works
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty well with lawn grasses and can be
mowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you mow it, the smaller the
plants can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not actually really spring
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually late summer flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have crocuses for the spring
and clover for later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other things that you mentioned,
self-heal, and you can also incorporate
[SPEAKER_00]: wild strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these different species,
they can't be incorporated into a lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to raise the height of cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe cut less frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also note that you'll have to change
your use habits of that space as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're not going to be as traffic
tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to see crocuses and
self-heal and clover surviving very well
[SPEAKER_00]: in, let's say, a commonly used soccer
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't see those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see dandelions because they are able to
handle high traffic and compacted soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you can incorporate and then call
that your bee lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say I could do that to my front
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll leave my back lawn as grass
so that I can still enjoy that with my dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think, Sarah, of those bee
mixes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Minnesota a couple of years ago,
I think, had a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the things like white clover or
self-heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried those out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to me, at least in my lawn
and a lot of people's lawns, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: high traffic areas or high visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then peripheral areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can just take an area,
maybe plant some of those mixes,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I mow it once a month or something,
that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess have you seen the efficacy
of those mixes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they perform well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that the alternative that people
should be looking at as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_01]: letting their lawn grow in May and
chopping it back down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we haven't seen any studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any studies on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen just colloquially in my own
neighborhood, I've seen a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_00]: have high success with these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, I would think that some of
these lawns, you just need to pay a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as sort of automatic,
like, I'll cut my grass when I want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawn maintenance is, in my opinion,
the easiest, least work for a homeowner,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a bee mix, you're probably going
to have to reseed that multiple times
[SPEAKER_00]: because flowers and flowering plants just
generally don't really like to be cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they're mowing tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're going to have to come back
every three years or something and add
[SPEAKER_00]: some more seed back into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be cognizant of,
like you said, high traffic areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be completely flower
meadow in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a pathway that you're going
back and forth to your shed, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have flowers in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just understanding and modifying your
expectations of your bee lawn,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to perform the same way as
a grass lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably going to have to be a
little bit more aware of the growth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you do let the, like,
even micro clover, we'd have a plot back
[SPEAKER_00]: here and we didn't mow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micro clover turned into macro clover
if you don't mow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you mow that down,
it still applies to the one third rule,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really shocking to that
plant and even more so than a grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to just put it on a calendar
and say, oh, I'm just going to mow every
[SPEAKER_00]: three weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you have, like you showed in the
beginning of this, that extreme flush of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, you're going to have to be mowing
it every week for that month, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general, the whole no mow may and
the hashtag and the cuteness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We as turf managers and you talk to any
farmer also, you can't do anything on a
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar because the weather changes year
to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Climate is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also ecosystems are totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do no mow may in Northern Ontario,
where the polar bears live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do no mow all summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe in Britain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's why it worked in the UK,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have a cooler May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us maybe shifting, like you said,
shifting the timing, Frank, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: no mow April.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first mow this year in I think in New
York was April 28th, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could probably, I can get away and
just by the nature of how the grass grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: without mowing in April.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sarah, you've mentioned a couple
alternatives here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the bee lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe that's an alternative,
but it's not quite as minimal no mow may
[SPEAKER_01]: no maintenance as we might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you mentioned earlier, just planting
other trees and shrubs in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the best way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those the, I guess the most nutritious
sources for pollinators early in the year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of the best way to give them
resources maybe beyond looking in the lawn
[SPEAKER_01]: for those resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's essentially don't do a
pop-up shop for four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan for the entire growing season.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can think of or visit your local
nursery and say what flowers in May,
[SPEAKER_00]: what flowers in June, July, August and
plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have a small space,
just even a hanging basket, a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: basket hanging off of your porch,
that's providing pollen resources that
[SPEAKER_00]: would otherwise not be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in my backyard, I actually started a
little naturalized area where I built a
[SPEAKER_00]: little fence and it's about two meters
squared that my dog won't go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to mow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw a random packet of wildflower
seeds at it once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't manage that at all because
actually removing garden residues,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those hollow stems that come out of
like sunflowers and stuff, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable nesting materials for bees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes our best intentions are
saying, yeah, let's provide pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't also provide pollinator support
in your habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say that the number one hit to
the carpenter bee was the invention of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gas furnace because we no longer have wood
piles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the carpenter bee likes to live in wood
piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even just having three or four logs in
your backyard that you just leave alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an amazing habitat for snakes and
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could just leave that in that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that it's an area that is safe
from your kids and your pets and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're supporting biodiversity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start small.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, you got to love this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: One week we're talking about killing grass
with salts, you know, and now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about snakes and rats and
carpenter bees because the landscapes that
[SPEAKER_02]: we manage are enormously complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things, Sarah, that they
involve and you've touched on it a few
[SPEAKER_02]: times and made the comment, and I just
want to reiterate it and get more thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you decide to have something that's
going to look at your lawn as a different
[SPEAKER_02]: function than traditional, which is mostly
you're looking at it and you run around
[SPEAKER_02]: your pets and your kids and you have lawn
parties and you walk on it and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you make the decision to help,
you know, and use this ecosystem service,
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance pollinators, you lose some of the
cultural stuff because you can't use that
[SPEAKER_02]: space for the things you used to use it
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not even talking about health
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one wants to walk through eight inch
grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not having a garden party with
everybody standing around in knee-high
[SPEAKER_02]: grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about importing
these, trying to create some native or
[SPEAKER_02]: some habitat or viewing these things
differently in the urban environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately, it's going to change the way
you're going to be able to use that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you've played around with this a
little bit, you mentioned a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of plants that will be
low growing that you could mow at three
inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four inches have a lawn that you can walk
on and do everything else on, but also has
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, incidental flowering
plants, as we like to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk a little bit more about when
people talk to you about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually say, I'm sure you say to
them, listen, you can't have a garden
[SPEAKER_02]: party in this thing when you stop mowing
it and make it a bee lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole backyard wedding industry will
shut down if everybody has a bee lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawns have functions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said backyard barbecues, social
events, even just me being able to hang my
[SPEAKER_00]: laundry in the backyard, I need to be able
to walk in the grass to be able to pin my
[SPEAKER_00]: laundry to my line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that maybe when you drive
past my lawn and I'm not physically out
[SPEAKER_00]: there on that moment, it looks like my
lawn is a useless space, but actually it
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing a lot of functions even when no
one's physically walking on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's holding that soil down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowing water to percolate back down
in to refill our ground aquifers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are our drinking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They act as a natural filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't think about this often,
but it's also temporary parking sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know most people in the winter will park
on their lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it all the time here when we have
field days, we park on the grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many functions that you don't
think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had a garden, this entire
backyard, I wouldn't be able to do those
[SPEAKER_00]: things when I want to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to use them even if I'm
not using them all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass is sort of the holding space for
future events, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the simplest and easiest, your point
about being simple and easy is well taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl, do we have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're at the fastest 30 minute
hour here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're right at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple, I think, concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich was talking about bees and pesticide
use and how that interacts with flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, Frank, we're starting to
think about and maybe promote is the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you're going to have pollinators
in your lawn, if you're going to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: incidental flowering plants, the clovers,
the self-heals, you probably shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: apply insecticide applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would say in one of the BMPs is to mow
flowers off before you make those
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're finding with clover,
you can run that mower over at two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half inches Hayden box data up in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still 50 percent of clover flowers
that didn't get cut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, and dandelion flowers stuck,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an inch and a half off the ground,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of aligning your pesticide use,
your IPM strategies with the functions of
[SPEAKER_01]: the lawn, I think, is one of the big keys
we're taking away from today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, great job on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody appreciate you joining us
for the fastest 30 minutes in turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one programming note.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be here next Thursday at 10 a
.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my last kid is graduating college.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will be standing there in tears as
I'm enjoying of happiness with the last
[SPEAKER_02]: tuition bill I paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for all of you, Sarah, thanks for
taking the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl, take it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk to you guys again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.

University on the Web at Cornell dot edu.
Thank you.
