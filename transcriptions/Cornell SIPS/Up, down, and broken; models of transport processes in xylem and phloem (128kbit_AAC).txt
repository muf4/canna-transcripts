[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vinay, for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Franny, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indeed, I'm very grateful to Vinay and
Alan Lacksoe, who have given me a very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting context to think about for
these last five years, grounded some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our naive ideas about plant physiology and
its relation to engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's nice to be here and see more
of the faces of horticulture at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell you about models of
transport processes in xylem and phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I wrote in my abstract,
these are both mathematical models and
[SPEAKER_01]: physical models.
[SPEAKER_01]: No plants, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No plant models.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll try to make connections to what
is observed in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have questions for you about what
might or might not be observable and what
[SPEAKER_01]: might be interesting questions to pose
with these models.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the work of a large number
of people in the group, a former postdoc,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Sessoms, Vinay, who's about to finish
and go off to start his own lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: Olivier Vincent, who's a current postdoc,
Michael Santiago here in the audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: a PhD student in mechanical engineering,
Eric Huber, another PhD in mechanical
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering, and Jean Comptet,
who was a summer student who worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: me and with Bob Turgeon on the first
example I'm going to speak to you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, I want to say that we were
inspired by plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just telling Neil that as you
look at a plant, you actually see an
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the engineering processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a lot of translation that
has to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once that translation is done,
a lot of the processes from the molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: through the macroscopic map onto chemical
engineering in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been interested in
transpiration and the material science of
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes transpiration possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to speak to you very briefly
about a question about regulating flow in
[SPEAKER_01]: the xylem and in more detail about sugar
translocation, the flow and loading
[SPEAKER_01]: process, and then show you a physical and
mathematical model of how failure occurs
[SPEAKER_01]: and how failure is coupled within the
complex architecture of the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then point to, for example,
recovery as an open challenge for us and
[SPEAKER_01]: for plant science to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do I get money for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in fact, plants do things that we
don't do or we don't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for example, the transpiration
process, if it could be coupled into the
[SPEAKER_01]: right materials, could be the basis for a
heat transfer technology that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: extendable out to building scale,
vehicle scale, and could be very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Air Force pays us to look at
questions about how to use liquids under
[SPEAKER_01]: tension in the context of heat transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've heard from Vinay and from Alan
Lacso about a microtechnology that could
[SPEAKER_01]: be a basis for communicating with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: By measuring water potential, by
controlling liquids in the way that plants
[SPEAKER_01]: control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A topic that we're just beginning with a
new student is the extraordinary process
[SPEAKER_01]: that plants use to live with their roots
outside of the water table to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract the pure liquid water that they
need to live from subsaturated soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a kind of truly magical seeming
process from an engineer's point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: a type of reverse reverse osmosis that we
simply don't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be very nice if we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to tell you today,
though, about our thinking about plant
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to keep it in the plant
context as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, I'm going to talk first
about down, about getting the loading
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a topic that I pursued with
Bob Turgeon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that he has a very strong
imprint on this field and on our
[SPEAKER_01]: particular question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then very briefly about questions of
local control of permeability that may be
[SPEAKER_01]: part of manipulating flow within the
xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, this question of cavitation
in mimics of xylem, the segmented
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of the xylem tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to jump right into flow and
loading and give you an overview here with
[SPEAKER_01]: a cartoon from Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: A publication a few years ago of Bob that
reviews the ideas of some plastic passive
[SPEAKER_01]: loading, where it's a purely diffusive
process with continuous synthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: generates a gradient in concentration,
diffusing into an intermediary cell in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sieve elements, and pulling in water and
driving flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A version, a kind of hybrid active passive
process, which is quite intriguing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe is Bob's invention.
[SPEAKER_01]: His baby is a trapping mechanism where
biological energy is expended in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of a passive process to presumably
increase the gradient in sucrose
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and improve translocation
rates, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, I think the most familiar
active process where you have ATPase
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pumping, again, directly using
the chemical energy to invert this
[SPEAKER_01]: gradient and drive translocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of the signatures that
Bob and others use of something other than
[SPEAKER_01]: passive, is that a passive species is
obliged to bring sucrose concentration,
[SPEAKER_01]: or photosynthate more generally,
concentrations high everywhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesophyll in order to drive this
concentration gradient, to drive passive
[SPEAKER_01]: diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas these two active mechanisms have a
way of segregating sugars to avoid having
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire leaf bathed in high
concentrations of photosynthate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the important ideas that
motivates the thinking about loading and
[SPEAKER_01]: loading strategies is the idea you don't
want your leaves with excessive
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthate concentrations because it
leaves you as an attractive leaf green
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to eat for species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there are other ideas out
there, but that's the one that's stuck in
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in general, these active mechanisms
minimize the photosynthate concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: and should, although it's hard to get
direct evidence, change the translocation
[SPEAKER_01]: rate or the export loading rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you some recent work,
or relatively recent work from the Turgen
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, where they, I think, get the most
convincing picture of this polymer
[SPEAKER_01]: trapping process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here we have this enzyme that is
going to do a so-called polymerization or
[SPEAKER_01]: oligomerization of the sucrose to create,
in particular, stachios, a four sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: species, and somehow keep it segregated
here and influence translocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is an example where the Turgen
group identified one of the players in
[SPEAKER_01]: this oligomerization process and was able
to knock it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see here is that, indeed,
this species is a polymerizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: oligomerizer, has significantly more of
these raffinose family oligosaccharides in
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves than a passive loader,
which has essentially none, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully knock down this
oligomerization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the consequences of this were that the
knockdown case failed to get rid of all
[SPEAKER_01]: that photosynthate and ended up with these
very high concentrations of the classic
[SPEAKER_01]: passive loader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And further, this had consequences on the
global health of this knockdown case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a strong suggestion that this
oligomerization process is part of
[SPEAKER_01]: improving the translocation efficiency,
allowing the plant to drive export without
[SPEAKER_01]: building up excessive concentrations of
photosynthetic product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also note, I don't have it on the
slide, but they nicely demonstrated in
[SPEAKER_01]: this paper that these enzymes were
localized in the so-called intermediary
[SPEAKER_01]: cell or companion cell of the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the phenomenon, again, for this
particular loading process is that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: simplistic, unlike the classic active
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through plasmodesmata.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this enzymatic conversion,
which you can think of as a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bootstrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a bootstrapping process on
top of a passive mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting an energy in an odd place in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has this characteristic segregation of
sugars in the intermediary cell and
[SPEAKER_01]: appears to have more efficient
translocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the questions are, we'd like to build a
model that would couple two water
[SPEAKER_01]: relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to emphasize that I think
it's crucial that you couple all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to the xylem to think about how loading
occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to add ingredients over here in
terms of coupling to the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The impact of polymerization and
segregation on rates of translocation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the relationship between, in particular,
pumping, the ability to export
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently, and segregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this segregation part of the mode of
operation of this trapping mechanism?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can then look towards putting some
constraints on what the plasmodesmata must
[SPEAKER_01]: be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is simplistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't think of plasmodesmata as being
very specific pore proteins that have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to select between two small
molecules, like sucrose and stachios.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here they seem to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can be good to think about what
a plasmodesmata in this particular class
[SPEAKER_01]: of plasmodesmata must look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with guidance from Bob, I took images
like this showing intermediary cell
[SPEAKER_01]: mesophyll and phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this being the special membrane that
contains these special plasmodesmata.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we built a new cartoon inspired by
Bob's original cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in particular, it's particular
additional ingredients like being coupled
[SPEAKER_01]: to the xylem at a well-defined,
typically negative, water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we have the potential to be
drawing in water directly into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mesophyll and water into the intermediary
cell where the enzyme is processing the
[SPEAKER_01]: sucrose into oligomers, with the eventual
possibility that this is not, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't expect it to be, a perfect
osmotic membrane to select between sucrose
[SPEAKER_01]: and stachios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this has hydraulics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have flows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be flow speeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I'm not going to have them out
explicitly, but we're going to get to some
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection coefficients, effective
reflection coefficients for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plasmodesmata membrane that's acting like
an osmotic membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to account for diffusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to run the enzymatic kinematics
at 0th order, V max.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do this with full Michaelis-Menten,
but I'm going to run it at 0th order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're keeping track of stachios,
sucrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this concentration of enzyme is
embedded in this enzymatic rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to remind you again that
underneath everything I'm going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you, we have a simple but a hydraulic
architecture of these two components of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf with a plasmodesmable membrane,
each coupled to the xylem and then coupled
[SPEAKER_01]: down to an unloading zone somewhere in the
root or fruit or somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep this very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we're going to just say that
unloading is not limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to keep the unloading,
the root pressure, in some sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be 0.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be easy to unload.
[SPEAKER_01]: But putting in loading limitations is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the Munch mechanism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Passive mechanism is the Munch hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start by a reduced version
of our model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, this is just the passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's passive because I don't have any
enzymes in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to, for now, just allow
sucrose to passively diffuse across this
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane, not allow water to be loaded
into the mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And think about what controls the
concentration of sucrose that pulls in
[SPEAKER_01]: water and drives the Munch pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the four equations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all there will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four unknowns here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know the flow rates of sucrose,
the flow rate of sucrose and of water
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration in the intermediary cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just point out that in these
coupled equations, there is the classic
[SPEAKER_01]: Munch process, which is to say there is
sucrose getting to this pocket that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coupled to the water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to have an osmotic strength that
can overcome the water potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a piece that isn't often considered is
that I'm going to emphasize is this
[SPEAKER_01]: conservation of sucrose is that the same
thing that Munch is trying to give you,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is flow to carry your sucrose,
is sweeping away your concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: gradient so that the concentration that
driving that osmotic process is inversely
[SPEAKER_01]: proportional to the flow that it's
creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that coupling that is crucial
in closing the Munch process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, Jean Conte, who built this
model, identified a dimensionless group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the things that we do
in our field is to try to group the
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters in a way that characterizes a
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, this loss of
concentration due to the water flow is a
[SPEAKER_01]: competition between the flow of water and
the diffusive flow of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be written like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the permeabilities, the hydraulic
permeabilities, a characteristic
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a negative number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being overcome by this osmotic
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a diffusion coefficient for
this membrane, a so-called mass transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: coefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this captures the impact of
convection on the trapping process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to show that it's a useful
number to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a case where we're going to
consider that the plant has a desired
[SPEAKER_01]: turgor, say, in its mesophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the levels of sucrose in the
mesophyll at a constant level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to ask, what happens when
I turn on the reaction rate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Q polymerization is going to be a
homogeneous reaction rate turning sucrose
[SPEAKER_01]: into stachios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so first, I'm going to turn on the
polymerization with a low phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, this is a high phloem process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there's lots of flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our so-called flushing number is bigger
than one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is that absolutely we
benefit from the trapping mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: By consuming, I'm going to the extreme
where the enzymes are fast enough that I
[SPEAKER_01]: use up all the sucrose it diffuses across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, in the munch picture,
here the red line being the concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: of sucrose between the mesophyll and the
intermediary cell, if I use up all the
[SPEAKER_01]: sucrose, I absolutely improve the rate at
which I move sucrose into the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trapping with high flow rate,
low flow rate, it's definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Polymerization, let's say,
oligomerization, will definitely improve
[SPEAKER_01]: the rate of export relative to no
oligomerization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no segregation in this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting rid of all of the
photosynthate that gets into the
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediary cell before it can pile up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have a polymer without
trapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is useful, but it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing you Apple on a so-called
purely passive loader.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I turn it on, on the other hand,
in the presence of a large resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: here I have this, I was thinking
resistance here, a small permeability for
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the transport phloem,
I get both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use up all my sucrose, drive more
diffusion, higher loading rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, if I'm not flushing it away too
quickly, I can end up with segregation and
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic this type of picture of the
loading and segregation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthate into the phloem elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've looked at this in a variety of
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I'm just showing the ratio this is
looking at segregation, the ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: intermediary cell concentration total of
all sugars versus in the mesofil as a
[SPEAKER_01]: function of the flow rate, the
non-dimensional flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see that we can get very large
segregation, but we can also have
[SPEAKER_01]: polymerization going on without any
segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here mesofil concentration below
intermediary cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, and this is,
I think, an important conclusion from this
[SPEAKER_01]: model, under any circumstance here,
increasing the polymerization rate
[SPEAKER_01]: increases the equivalent sucrose export
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is always a good idea to polymerize,
whether you segregate or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just say briefly that I've shown
this in the simplest case, but if we go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to a full connection, full water
relation, in a sense, and the possibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of having intermediate reflection
coefficients for this plasmadecimal
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane, these same trends hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are almost identical looking
plots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our understanding right now is that
localized polymerization always is
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial from the point of view of
export, but does not depend on
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a question for Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why segregate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tell you just the next
few slides, segregating is not trivial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to turn these plasmadecimal
into an osmotic membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to suggest that there's some
other reason to segregate that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do with improving the rate of
export.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we've been
discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to continue to discuss,
but I'll be interested in if there are any
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one interesting idea that emerged from
Jean's model is, and here Bob pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: together this set of data showing that a
lot of passive loaders, in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, which surprisingly you'd think
trees are always classified, the big guys
[SPEAKER_01]: who have to export over meters and meters
and meters, are all passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do polymerize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They oligomerize.
[SPEAKER_01]: They oligomerize, they don't segregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what Jean has shown in this model is
that any polymerization is good
[SPEAKER_01]: polymerization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking away that sucrose,
increasing that gradient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's some possibility that these
guys are another version of polymer
[SPEAKER_01]: trappers that take advantage of the
increased translocation efficiency without
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to now just finish with this
topic with questions about the
[SPEAKER_01]: plasmodesmina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've alluded to this that it's not
obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually think a plasmodesmina is being
big, big pores, many molecules across.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we distinguishing between a
sucrose and a stachyose, which a
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable hydraulic dimension of a
sucrose would be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One nanometer and a stachyose just 1.4 in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a micrograph of the special
type of plasmodesmina that are found in
[SPEAKER_01]: these trappers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a pretty big structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we're thinking about this
as an annular lumen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thinking about a substructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not easy to see how you get
selectivity based on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to try to build a simple
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is partly to check an idea that
Bob first mentioned to us in our first
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, which is that partly this
could be hydrodynamic selectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a pressure gradient,
a water potential gradient in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: between the mesophyll and the intermediary
cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is going to drive a convective
flow through that same pore through which
[SPEAKER_01]: sucrose and stachyose are trying to
diffuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucrose is going to be going with the
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stachyose is going to be trying to diffuse
against the flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to the extent that you can bootstrap
this system and get it going, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be tending to give you the selectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be tending to exclude
stachyose from back diffusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what this first, this is for
the very generic diffusion and convection,
[SPEAKER_01]: Poiseuille flow through a pipe appropriate
for macroscale.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it says is even if we have no,
absolutely no mechanism for selectivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the guys who are trying to back
diffuse, we can get to a ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: There would be a ratio of the pore size to
the solute size at which you will go from
[SPEAKER_01]: back diffusion to convective expulsion of
the stachyose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a purely hydrodynamic
convection-based mechanism by which you
[SPEAKER_01]: could have this apparent selectivity and
segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've gone on, there are, we've picked
the simplest model to take into account
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially just sterics of the pore with
a dimension R and a solute that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: dimension that's not far from R.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we find is, and this impacts as R
changes, it impacts both the solvent and
[SPEAKER_01]: the solute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can find is at very small
ratios of pore to solute, so saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: the pore is just 1.5 fold what the solute
is, we can find that also that this steric
[SPEAKER_01]: selectivity, steric reflection coefficient
can give us an inhibit back flow of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stachyose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, this same model of
hindered, so-called hindered transport by
[SPEAKER_01]: Dean et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: actually had very large pore sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, can give us a purely convective
mechanism for selectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to summarize the findings of
this in this state diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bringing back our flushing parameter,
keeping track of the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: convection through from the xylem to the
phloem, and keeping track of one
[SPEAKER_01]: non-dimensional geometrical piece of
information, the pore size to the solute
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are for, these boundaries are,
these lines are boundaries between a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: sea of non-segregating cases and a very
small set of parameters that give us
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I mean by it's not easy to
segregate.
[SPEAKER_01]: To segregate with a, in the presence of,
with this hindered transport model,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be at very low through flow
rates of water and very small ratios of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pore to the solute size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we take on a typical ratio of
stachyose to sucrose of 1.4, the pore has
[SPEAKER_01]: to just be a couple nanometers across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just remind you that the pore
is not, this is a picture that Bob pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: us to of this annular region with
obstructions in the form of proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are coming, the plasma has two
membranes, it's this annular region that's
[SPEAKER_01]: free, and these, what we can think of as
nano channels and not just micro channels,
[SPEAKER_01]: passing in between this obstacle course of
protruding proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as we know, this is about how well
we understand that architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This blurry transmission electron
micrograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're pointing to here is that within
that bone or if we're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: segregation, we're going to be at these,
those effective openings between those
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins are going to be very small
indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just point out that if we avoid
hindrance, purely convective segregation
[SPEAKER_01]: can occur, but only for unrealistically
large differences in the size of the two
[SPEAKER_01]: solutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can open up another region where
segregation occurs but it's pointing again
[SPEAKER_01]: to the need for some sort of selectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I'm putting it into the
difference in size of these two molecules,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: To summarize, I think you don't have to go
far in terms of building a model on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: munch type ideas, but you do need to bring
in water relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do need to bring in the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do need to bring in the convection
that is the through convection that is
[SPEAKER_01]: from the xylem down into the transport
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Importantly, oligomerization is always a
good idea if you're a passive loader with
[SPEAKER_01]: some plastic paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always makes sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a bunch of passive loaders that we
have not been thought of in this way are
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact taking advantage of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, segregation is a
mystery from my point of view right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob's going to have to explain it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, plasmodesmina in some sense can
be brought down to a scale where they act
[SPEAKER_01]: like a poor protein, like a selective poor
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do that, you, not surprisingly,
have to get down to a molecular scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we have essentially a billiard
ball kind of model of transport to a
[SPEAKER_01]: plasmodesmina, but it points to the need,
in particular, you can't just have
[SPEAKER_01]: convective selectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do need some what is essentially a
chemical-like selectivity in that
[SPEAKER_01]: plasmodesminal membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to speed ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go very briefly through
an idea that we explored with Michael
[SPEAKER_01]: Santiago and Vinay that is an observation
in the literature that the border pit
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane membranes change their
permeability as a function of the
[SPEAKER_01]: composition of the xylem sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: One proposal for why they might be doing
this is that the plant could actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: modifying the composition of the xylem sap
to change the permeability of its xylem
[SPEAKER_01]: and direct flows within the xylem tissue,
conductive tissue, to deal with,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, gradients in composition of
the soil, water potential, thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: gradients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is an observation of Martin
Zimmerman in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was followed up by Maciek Zwinecki and
Missy Holbrook a little over 10 years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and very cleanly showed that with respect
to ionic strength, millimolars of ionic
[SPEAKER_01]: strength, the permeability of xylem
tissue, which is supposed to be this
[SPEAKER_01]: passive conduit, in fact, changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, resistance goes down as
ionic strength goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance goes down with pH going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're coupling to some chemical
characteristics of the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an important piece of this work is
that they isolated passage through an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual border pit membrane and showed
that this remained true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they pinpointed the border pit
membrane as the source of this
[SPEAKER_01]: variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a very clean story.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got into science.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you have to have a clean story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, the story is not so clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, Kosher and many others have
found that there are species in which this
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called ion effect is backwards,
zero, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're seeing, just to clarify,
what we're seeing here is the flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here, a normalized flow rate with
respect to the zero ionic strength case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to point out that,
and you can see this in the paper that
[SPEAKER_01]: just came out, that we looked at an
explanation of this based on what's
[SPEAKER_01]: so-called the electrokinetic phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pointing this out partly to remind
you or make you aware of the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: there are electric fields in plants during
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because plant tissues are charged,
essentially all tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: All materials are charged in the presence
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant tissues are going to be negative
because of carboxylic acid groups in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you convect through a pore,
for example, through the border pit
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane, you're going to carry the
counter ions that are associated with the
[SPEAKER_01]: charged tissue from one end to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to lead to a polarization in
the electrolyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is going to create an electric field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're looking at here in the
so-called electroviscous effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: that electric field actually drives a net
flow back and reduces the amount of total
[SPEAKER_01]: flow you get for a given pressure
difference across the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether this is important to any of you or
to anybody, this particular electroviscous
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we could have tens of millivolts,
maybe 100 millivolts voltage difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over very small distances within the
xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that's the polarization of
a plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the potential to actually,
for these electrical effects, couple the
[SPEAKER_01]: flow to be part of, for example,
signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just show that this model,
there's a big cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reduced somewhat from the literature on
these effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in taking the ones that had a large,
large range of the relative permeability
[SPEAKER_01]: for the charged channel versus an
uncharged channel as a function of ionic
[SPEAKER_01]: strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we took here, our predictions are
this dotted line and this solid line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the lowest end of the range of
surface charge that we could find to be
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable for tissues in the xylem and on
the border pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the high end of the range of
surface potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or surface charge density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we see is that a reasonable part
of this cloud fits our predictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one important aspect of our
predictions is that it's non-monotonic,
[SPEAKER_01]: this electroviscous effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we lower ionic strength into the tens
of millimolar range, the viscosity grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lower permeability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it plateaus and rises up slightly
again as we go towards the ionized water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we can conclude from this is
not that this is the mechanism for the ion
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, but that it absolutely is going to
be present, whether it's dominant or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We propose some experiments that can
distinguish them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping we or someone else is
going to do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, again, the bottom line is
that there are certainly effects possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: For electric fields in xylem tissue,
and they could be part of signaling,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially part of a refilling process,
or translocation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to finish with our synthetic
models of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some simple structure like this we call a
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got two zones where it can
exchange with the outside world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a zone that is wetter,
we'll call the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: A zone that's drier, we'll call the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're moving this in the silicon
so that, for example, we can measure
[SPEAKER_01]: things quantitatively about the state of
water in this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can start putting in
architectural features like the segmented
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll first give you a little update
on what Vinay's been up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell you about one version of this
synthetic tree we call a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially, it's a leaf coupled to a
pressure transducer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the context that Vinay has told you
about is that this is what a tensiometer
[SPEAKER_01]: is called today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like one to extend the range of
function by several orders of magnitude
[SPEAKER_01]: and the form factor so that, for example,
this can become an embeddable technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the key to this, and this is what
we do, is to find materials that can act
[SPEAKER_01]: like the mesophyll in relation to
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, hold onto water with a
meniscus that has very high radius of
[SPEAKER_01]: curvature, very small radius of curvature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Order a few nanometers so that we can get
to capillary pressure differences between
[SPEAKER_01]: the liquid and the gas outside of tens to
hundreds of megapascals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by going into silicon, we can also
build transducers direct to get electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: signals as a function of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are very well-behaved mechanical
systems that give us simple signal and can
[SPEAKER_01]: be calibrated against well-defined
pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the exciting things that's the
first results to come out of this is to
[SPEAKER_01]: truly visualize water and stress well
beyond what's believed to occur in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is an example of a calibrated
device where here's the voltage across
[SPEAKER_01]: this sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the pressure across this
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one where Vinay just put it on
the bench and allowed it to dry in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: dry atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much to our pleasure, it failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it failed at over 300 bars,
over 30 megapascals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think this, in any context of
creating liquids under tension,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the largest negative pressure that
has ever been measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly in the context of plants,
a plant-like mechanism of a porous
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane coupling to a low water
potential, this is a strong support of
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixon-Knight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixon and Jolie and Ashkenazi and all the
others who put forward cohesion tension
[SPEAKER_01]: theory over 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the nice things I'll show you a few
times in such a system is that we can also
[SPEAKER_01]: watch the consequences of tension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is one of these pockets of
liquid during the moment when failure
[SPEAKER_01]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can see here is dramatically
the extremely violent event that
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation or embolization is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see is that a turbulent flow
emerges in a 25 micron gap that's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters wide here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also see, for better or for worse,
this is violent enough that it starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually damage our silicon and glass
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the edge, it starts to be bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a nice opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of being useful, this is the
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This over 300 bars is an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually have some 15, 20 runs with
running these things to their stability
[SPEAKER_01]: limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all go to over 10 megapascals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives us a sense of a new technology
to couple the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the laboratory, they're starting to be
very well-behaved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is work of Michael Santiago.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, what this gives us is a new
measure of the thermodynamics of water
[SPEAKER_01]: under tension, which has only been
measured along, in fact, this isotherm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can see is that a calibrated
tensiometer agrees with the equation of
[SPEAKER_01]: state, the international equation of
state, at 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's important questions about the
international equation of state of water
[SPEAKER_01]: as you go to cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vinay actually just got one of these into
soil from the Venice lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can see is he got a
tensiometer that's going to take nine bars
[SPEAKER_01]: in a drying soil, which is, again,
showing that we're now at a completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different regime for tensiometry than is
currently accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also point out it wasn't fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a slow experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is one of the challenges that we
can address within this format by changing
[SPEAKER_01]: the geometry of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just point out, we are interested
in people with large stress questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: deserts, trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like excuses to be going to 100
bars in the soil or in your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to finish with the questions
about failure, about cavitation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to point to you this nice
meta-analysis across many studies that
[SPEAKER_01]: shows, surprisingly, how many species live
right at their 50% loss of conductivity
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even those that don't, they live at
some 25% of loss of conductivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: which says that plants every single day
are embolizing, cavitating, and
[SPEAKER_01]: recovering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very recently, in this room,
we saw the group from Davis tell us about
[SPEAKER_01]: direct visualization of embolisms within
xylem vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even more intriguingly, refilling in
real time within vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we're not all lucky enough to
have Lawrence Berkeley lab across the
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what most people do, including Vinay
with Alan Lacksoe and Taryn up in Geneva,
[SPEAKER_01]: is to measure acoustically a non-invasive
method of getting information out about
[SPEAKER_01]: the failure modes within the xylem tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is just a collection on great
vine of the number of acoustic events
[SPEAKER_01]: versus water potential in a vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And interestingly, what would be nice is
if we could learn more from these
[SPEAKER_01]: non-invasive techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some way to do statistics and
learn about the dynamics in such a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that we could do the inverse problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we learn about the local architecture
that created it and the dynamics that
[SPEAKER_01]: created it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, in this data, what we'll
see is that there are times when it
[SPEAKER_01]: pulses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be huge events, and then nothing,
and then huge events, and then nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting also, there's a power law
distribution in event sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like avalanches or stock market crashes,
there's some interesting dynamics that
[SPEAKER_01]: defines the size of these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we've been doing
with this synthetic system is to create
[SPEAKER_01]: these segmented architecture, where we
have here vessel elements coupled through
[SPEAKER_01]: the same nanoporous silicon to other
vessel elements, and then coupled to the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside world, where we can generate
stresses by presenting low water
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're looking at here is three
full cavities.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is in the midst of cavitating,
and then this guy's empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to show you some movies
like this, now looking from the top over a
[SPEAKER_01]: big array.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is we're drying these
out into an 85% relative humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were very pleased to see is
that we have these isolated events.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is robustness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the proposal, the textbook
proposal for why xylem remains segmented,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that a cavitation event doesn't spread
in an uncontrolled manner along the full
[SPEAKER_01]: length of the xylem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, indeed, is what we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dynamics is more complicated than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely do have some propensity to
drive, to cavitate more near the high
[SPEAKER_01]: stress zones, but there's this very rough
drying front that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is surprising in a physical
science context.
[SPEAKER_01]: A material, if you start extracting liquid
from it, you'd think it should dry from
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside, where the stresses are
largest.
[SPEAKER_01]: More interestingly, if you watch this in
detail, what you'll see is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact, it's doing something very
regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pulling in a steady manner,
and it's responding.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in a series of avalanches,
very controlled avalanches that occur of a
[SPEAKER_01]: similar size and a timing that seems to be
very strictly controlled by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something's going on to couple these
failure events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just shows that these
correlations of this time trail of
[SPEAKER_01]: avalanches goes out towards tens of
minutes to an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing is that we can also hear
these same events.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, using the same acoustic
transducer that goes into the field,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can hear these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create a strong acoustic ultrasonic
shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it has very similar
signatures to the ones that we see from
[SPEAKER_01]: woody species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our first hypothesis was that these
events are triggering each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cavitation event sends an acoustic
signal and triggers another, or another
[SPEAKER_01]: series of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, though, what I show here
are correlations on the scale of five,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ring down of one of these acoustic
events is just a millisecond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these do have, there's interest in the
fact that they create acoustic signals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can't be what's coupling these
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we went back to our data and
looked more closely, and in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: started to look at spatial information
about these correlations, what we saw was
[SPEAKER_01]: that if we plotted the position between
two subsequent events versus the time
[SPEAKER_01]: between those subsequent events,
we actually had this cloud with a very
[SPEAKER_01]: clear hole in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That within this zone, an event that
occurs at time zero inhibits a second
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation event for this period of time
over this distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, when we look at this envelope
on this inhibited zone, it in fact has a
[SPEAKER_01]: square root of time behavior that suggests
a diffusive phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in fact, what we think, and we're quite
convinced now, is of hydraulic suppression
[SPEAKER_01]: of adjacent events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, I think, relates to interesting
ideas about why plants do go to 25%,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50% of their cavitation possibility in a
given day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so very quickly, what we can write
down, and this will be true for plants as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, is a diffusion equation for pressure
in this medium, in the xylem tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any porous medium will have some
elasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, in our very rigid material,
it's elasticity of water and a
[SPEAKER_01]: permeability, which is its Darcy
permeability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And together, these create a diffusion
constant for pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pressure solves the time-dependent
diffusion equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this problem, this time-dependent
diffusion is coupled to the kinetics of
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation, which is a function of the
pressure that's being diffused around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this shows what our understanding
of this process is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, this is Eric Huber's model of
those equations I just showed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we saw is the pressure drop
coming in from the edge, creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation event in this first cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That then sent out a wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the wave could reach it,
the wave is going out of suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two guys cavitated before that
suppression wave could come and meet them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all then spread out, refill the
medium with water that's freed up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: cavitation event, and thus suppress
further cavitation events for a period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we believe this now is from this
type of model of our same experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see essentially a one-to-one match
of the dynamics we get in our experimental
[SPEAKER_01]: system and with this coupled pressure
diffusion reaction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think what's important is that
I've seen this proposed in the literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of the xylem water
serving as a reservoir of water for the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue that doesn't cavitate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have vulnerable zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cavitate, and they give you water to
release tension transiently in the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: To connect this back, the inverse problem,
we now have one explanation for why we
[SPEAKER_01]: might see these periodic events in
acoustic data at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have an explanation for this
power law of distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a nice possibility now to look
at other architectures, try to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the dynamics and design criteria for xylem
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm showing here is, in fact,
this same system will refill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have tricks to get this system to mimic
refilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an opportunity to look at some
of the proposals for how xylem repairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll finish with these reminders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain to you that your choice of
species to study, there are excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: engineers and inspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are opportunities for technologies,
both to interface with plants and to go
[SPEAKER_01]: out into other places in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then models, both mathematical and
physical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all models are wrong, but potentially
can be useful to constrain the way you
[SPEAKER_01]: think about a system that you have a lack
of information on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I'd like to again
acknowledge in particular Vinay and
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael, Olivier, Jean, and Eric for their
direct participation in this work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, and I'd be happy to take
any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
