[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a pleasure to be among the
soil scientists and particularly Tony who
[SPEAKER_00]: was very generous with his time in
teaching us about his work as a scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: many years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my former students interviewed Tony
and that interview was edited into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we call an oral history
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was included in that 2010 book that
Tony mentioned and I'll be quoting you in
[SPEAKER_00]: a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may be fairly agitated right
now and angry and worried not just about
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in the election but about
deeper issues and questions that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the state of our society,
how well, how divided we are, how well or
[SPEAKER_00]: how poorly we understand each other,
how well or how poorly we listen to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not irrelevant for me to say that at
the beginning of this session because the
[SPEAKER_00]: theme or topic or idea of civic science is
very much centered on relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: between scientists and non-scientists that
include a lot of listening and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and a lot of dealing with
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a topic that I have been
working on for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, as most of us do, way too many
balls in the air and so things proceed
[SPEAKER_00]: more slowly than they should but we had an
NSF workshop on this theme as Tony
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned in 2014 or working on both an
essay and a book project related to this
[SPEAKER_00]: theme of civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The theme resonates across a lot of my
work so it's something that isn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: contained there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel rather strangely double-miked here
so I feel like I'm on an interrogation
[SPEAKER_00]: stage or something and then I see this one
person sitting there in Geneva like the
[SPEAKER_00]: judge sitting in front of the court.
[SPEAKER_00]: So civic science is a term, like a lot of
terms we hear about, that first of all it
[SPEAKER_00]: has a history as a specific term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of its genealogy is that it was
first, actually maybe first, probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: first, but maybe first used in 1996 in a
talk that Neil Lane gave when he was the
[SPEAKER_00]: director of NSF and he was speaking to a
meeting of the American Association for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Advancement of Science and talking
about the role of science and scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: in society and he used the term civic
science to talk about basically the idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that scientists should be communicating to
the public more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be taking more time to be
helping the public understand science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be taking more time to share
the results of science, to be bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific knowledge and ideas to the
public in all kinds of variety of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just panels in Washington DC,
not just media interviews but in community
[SPEAKER_00]: settings as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not what I mean by civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The definition that he gave is not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civic science is also not citizen science.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I'm talking about it, it's not
applied research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not activist science.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of terms out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to share a bit about how I have
been coming to find and discover this idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of civic science in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I've been trying to make sense of
it and some of the questions I have about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to be relying on notes a lot
here but I want to be careful and as I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned I'm fairly agitated right now
and suffering from lack of sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a state legislator.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was just reelected to her seventh term
in the New York State Assembly so I was up
[SPEAKER_00]: all night the other night and apologies
for my own trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So civic science is not a dreamy
theoretical thing that some egghead
[SPEAKER_00]: professor like me in development sociology
made up and is trying to sell to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of naming a discovery out of my
own research, out of other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm primarily a historian but I come to
the work of history with a lot of tools
[SPEAKER_00]: from a variety of disciplines,
science and technology studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: development sociology, narrative inquiry
and analysis, civic studies, political
[SPEAKER_00]: theory, public philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I draw from all of those in my historical
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civic science is something that is deeply
rooted in land grant colleges of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, including this one very much
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not contained to those colleges
as a historical tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of the things that has
happened recently in the in the literature
[SPEAKER_00]: that I pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A historian from Harvard named Andrew
Jewett has published a book recently that
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a review for for a journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Science, Democracy and the
American University from the Civil War to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cold War.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he does in this book is he traces
what he refers to as a history of
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific Democrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his term.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Civil War to the Cold War.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's tracing is something that
there's not a lot of awareness of in a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole variety of places and there's a lot
of critique of and pushback against.
[SPEAKER_00]: What he's tracing is this history of
thinking and work about how science,
[SPEAKER_00]: the methods and processes of science,
have huge deep cultural and political
[SPEAKER_00]: significance and possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of people thinking these
are mostly people in fields like political
[SPEAKER_00]: theory and philosophy and psychology and
those kinds of fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were deeply convinced that
if we could spread scientific,
[SPEAKER_00]: what people like John Dewey variously
referred to as the scientific spirit or
[SPEAKER_00]: the scientific morale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberty High Bailey wrote about this which
I'll come back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could spread that, if people could
learn to see the world using some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and processes of science,
this would have huge transformational
[SPEAKER_00]: implications for our culture and ones that
are aligned with what we usually refer to
[SPEAKER_00]: as democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of you in this room, I'm assuming,
are scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make them visible and public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you did, what you found,
and it's up for debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people can try it and see if they
find the same thing or something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's real deep democratic possibilities
in that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out of the whole notion of who
gets to create knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the work of science, anybody who
can learn these methods and processes can
[SPEAKER_00]: take part in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't come just from the church or a
dogma or the government or the king.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are big historical things I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there's this long tradition of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civic science is connected to that,
as I'll talk about a little more clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the center of civic science as an idea,
the way I'm understanding it is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: represents a particular way of answering a
set of normative questions about the
[SPEAKER_00]: roles, responsibilities, purposes,
and work of scientists and scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions like universities in the
civic sphere or in civic or public life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the questions about the nature
of the relationship between scientists and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-scientists, particularly in societies
that strive to be or want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: democratic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civic science represents a way of
answering these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to note normative questions
are not empirical questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not about what is or what has been
or what could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use this troubling word in the
academy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of problems with this word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civic science represents a way of
answering a set of questions by taking the
[SPEAKER_00]: word should and answering it, not just in
theory or ideas, but in practice in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the prevailing way of answering this
bundle of questions about the role and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between science and
non-scientists and science in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: sphere, the prevailing way of
understanding that is that it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: an expert-client relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science, scientists, scientific
institutions produce stuff which is
[SPEAKER_00]: communicated out to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they produce stuff from a place of
detachment from that world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, to use the fancy academic words,
there's an epistemological reason for
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the most fundamental
questions we could take up in any society
[SPEAKER_00]: is how do we produce knowledge that people
can trust, trustworthy knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole way, a kind of
prevailing sense of, well, you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: detached thing that's outside the biased
and messy world of the marketplace and the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't trust stuff that comes out of
there because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: self-interested and biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need someplace that's apart from
that where people can pursue work from an
[SPEAKER_00]: objective, disinterested, unbiased,
these kinds of words people use,
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the sort of the typical way that
we look at this set of normative
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about what we should do, what our
relationship should be, our meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So civic science, as I've been learning in
my research and work and have been
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, coming to understand,
doesn't dismiss, it's not about dismissing
[SPEAKER_00]: questions of trustworthiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, in a land-grant
institution, we're not just interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: trustworthiness, we're interested in
knowledge people can trust and use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The use piece is pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the civic science tradition that I'm
uncovering and trying to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't dismiss all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say that we should never have
people working from a place of detachment
[SPEAKER_00]: in laboratories on campuses up on hills
like Cornell here, the classic ivory
[SPEAKER_00]: tower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say we shouldn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm finding in my own work,
and this is definitely influenced by my
[SPEAKER_00]: own perspective, which I need to be
transparent about, the fancy word for that
[SPEAKER_00]: is reflexive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be reflexive is to be conscious of your
own biases and political views and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: candid about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely have them and that'll
come out in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tradition that I'm uncovering
doesn't reject all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does, and the best way to
understand it, is it expands and broadens
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground and the set of possibilities
for how to be a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that scientists don't always have
to be detached in laboratories up on
[SPEAKER_00]: hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sometimes you can be there and you
can be out in the... And telling people in
[SPEAKER_00]: this room this, of course, this is nothing
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people have done in this
college for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everybody thinks about that or
understands that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important about civic science,
I think, which moves us to the place of
[SPEAKER_00]: deep, deep, deep complexity, way beyond
what I'm gonna be able to do here with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, both because of time and other
issues, what's important about it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't just expand these possibilities
of how to do work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also opens up very distinctive kinds of
promises, of meaning and significance of
[SPEAKER_00]: the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing that, it opens up very
distinctive kinds of challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanna do today, hopefully in
enough time for us to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction, because I could go on for way
too long in my agitated state,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna begin with a couple of historical
artifacts from our own college here at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brief historical artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wanna very briefly and very
superficially start taking up the task of
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting those artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the research that I do as a
scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working with original material and
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a historian, I don't just paste and
copy that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to position it in a narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to position it in an essay that
interprets the meaning and significance of
[SPEAKER_00]: these artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to put them in context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to use tools to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna very briefly sort of show you
sort of the inside, it's like walking into
[SPEAKER_00]: my lab in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the inside nuts and bolts of how
we work with this material, thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: these artifacts like you would think of
plant material or soil samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wanna turn to the issue of actual
practice of civic science in contemporary
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm gonna quote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gonna quote somebody else more
than I'm gonna quote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I wanna conclude by just naming
some of the challenges and questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: arise for me in thinking about this theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I plunge into this,
I'll say that I am approaching and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this work in many ways out of a sense of
urgent necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think institutions like this are
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our communities and our
society is in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond the trouble, I think there are
enormous, incredible possibilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: are untapped, positive possibilities that
civic science I think has a big role to
[SPEAKER_00]: play in opening up, both in dealing with
troubles, but also in opening up
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are the artifacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are two things I've found in my
historical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The little data points, little moments in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one actually is from 1922.
[SPEAKER_00]: The former director of Cornell Cooperative
Extension, a man named Maurice Chase
[SPEAKER_00]: Burritt, M.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burritt, grew up on a farm in Western New
York, a graduate of Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the County Agent and the Farm
Bureau, a real barn buster, barn burner
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of title, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We all wanna read.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 1922, so it was pretty shortly
after the Farm Bureau was created.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the first one was in New York in
Broome County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shortly after 1914, less than 10 years
after when the National Extension System
[SPEAKER_00]: was created, and this county agent thing
was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy went on, I don't know if anybody
knows who he was, but he had all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: roles in New York agriculture and state
and United States policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this book, he actually
didn't write this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to go to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says at the last two pages,
he said, Summarizing then, the ideals
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in this volume for the Farm
Bureau movement may be put in the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: this brief creed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he lays out what he calls a Farm
Bureau creed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are four sentences from that
creed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are the next three sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in a program, a definite,
carefully considered plan of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: local in conception and in character,
which looks toward the solution of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems which are vital to the welfare of
the farm and the home.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plan of action for the organization
should be made at home by those most
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned, but with the best expert advice
and assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last sentence, we believe in
a partnership between farmers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: public agricultural agencies between
practice and science for the working out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are sentences about self-help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fierce voice of independence,
of you damn well better respect us,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're gonna solve our own
problems, but we wanna be in some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best assistance, best expert advice and
assistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're talking about a partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the next little artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1949, the history of Cornell
Cooperative Extension was published.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by Ruby Green Smith,
who spent three decades as the Home Bureau
[SPEAKER_00]: leader in the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave it the very wonderful title,
The People's Colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just one little, this is like
a 600 page book, which Cornell University
[SPEAKER_00]: Press has just republished in the past few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote the preface for the new edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easily available, very interesting
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a passage, here's a little
passage from that as another artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just pulling this out of one of these,
it's on page 544 of this book,
[SPEAKER_00]: all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension workers need to have faith in
spiritual values and to recognize the
[SPEAKER_00]: human relationships that contribute to
what the ancient Greeks called the good
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should believe that in the kinds of
homes, farms and industries which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: goals of extension service, man cannot
live by bread alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it is not enough for people to have
food, shelter and clothing, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: aspire also to find appreciation,
respect for individuality and human
[SPEAKER_00]: dignity, affection, ideals and
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the satisfactions that belong to
democratic living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a historian, I came into my work
being fascinated with these land-grant
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges because I was deeply interested
in the question of what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between higher education,
universities, colleges and universities
[SPEAKER_00]: and the public and communities,
which quickly goes to the place of what
[SPEAKER_00]: are we supposed to be doing, what are
these institutions do, what's our work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've been doing this research now
for 20 years, I've been finding these
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting voices that you hear in
these two passages from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not speaking about the kind of
thing we would expect to be hearing about,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not spiritual issues about the
extension agent or the extension service.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going on in these passages?
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving now to the next thing I said I
was gonna talk about, how do we interpret
[SPEAKER_00]: the meaning and significance of those two
artifacts that I just showed you as
[SPEAKER_00]: discoveries from my work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have hundreds and hundreds of other
discoveries like this, the sort of pattern
[SPEAKER_00]: of a way of thinking, of things being
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, this pushes us in
really complex territory because in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to interpret these kinds of passages,
not only do we have to put them in their
[SPEAKER_00]: context of their time and place,
not only do we have to put them in some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of historical trajectory,
we need tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you need tools, those of you who
are soil scientists, to do your analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use tools in the field that I
work in basically as a historical
[SPEAKER_00]: sociologist and that sort of place in the
development sociology field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use conceptual and theoretical tools
and frameworks to make sense of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in addition to the historical
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other part of the complexity of
course here is that we're not just dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with determining what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back to the empirical versus
normative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just determining what this
person said this thing in this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to work with trying to understand
what were they trying to argue?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the cultural significance,
the larger social, political significance
[SPEAKER_00]: of what they were saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to engage in those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets us in all kinds of trouble as
you might imagine because we then engage
[SPEAKER_00]: in all the debates about difference that
people have about the answer to normative
[SPEAKER_00]: questions of what we should do,
what we should not do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, sparing you all the complex
details of the fine grain nuanced and
[SPEAKER_00]: jargon laden material that I would have to
open up to talk about these conceptual and
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical frames.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just do something quickly to
sort of as part of the work of making
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of those artifacts, part of it
includes going back in history because we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to situate it in a historical
trajectory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go back and then I want to go
to the present before I conclude with sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions and concerns out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go back first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because both of those artifacts,
in making sense of them, get us to the
[SPEAKER_00]: place where we're asking questions about
scientists in scientific institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of those things, we're talking
about Cornell's College of Agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: in those days College of Home Economics as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be thinking about a historical
trajectory of those institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I've done my historical work,
one of the things I've seen moving back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-19th century is the presence of
two things that I think the work of civic
[SPEAKER_00]: science and the idea of civic science has
brought together and continues to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: together in its contemporary practice even
though it's mostly unnamed, mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: untheorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one of course has to do with
things that I would assume many of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: really familiar with and centered on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get to this, I'm going to quote
Justin Smith Morrill who as many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know was the author of the Morrill Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was passed in 1862.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working on a paper about his vision
and the vision of Jonathan Baldwin Turner
[SPEAKER_00]: who was a contemporary of his who many
people think is the real father of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Land Grant Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a passage from the speech that
Turner gave to, let's see, this is 37th
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was in June of 1862.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's, imagine the floor of Congress,
1862, Justin Smith Morrill's on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the things he says is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In American farming, the land is held
until it is robbed of its virtue,
[SPEAKER_00]: skimmed of its cream, and then the owner,
selling his wasted field to some
[SPEAKER_00]: skin-flint neighbor, flies to fresh fields
with the foul purpose to repeat the same
[SPEAKER_00]: spoilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thus annual exodus which prevails over
all the older states and even begins upon
[SPEAKER_00]: the first settlements of the new states
before their remoter borders have lost
[SPEAKER_00]: sight of the savage, this is his language,
painfully indicates that we have reached
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximum population our land will
support on the present state of our
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring forth new states by the litter
and when we want more like our Norman
[SPEAKER_00]: ancestors, we commit grand larceny and
annex them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This progress seems wonderful,
but with it appears the bitter fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: these new states in half a century,
a brief time in the history of the states,
[SPEAKER_00]: become depleted and stationary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This early maturity is followed by a
sudden barrenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phrase in these days was soil
exhaustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the term that they were using,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of this, he paints this grim
picture of basically how the land in the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is being totally destroyed by this
horrendously bad farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he issues what I think of as a
prophecy of doom.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, should no effort be made to
arrest the deterioration and spoilation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil in America while all Europe is
wisely striving to teach her
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculturalists the best means of
hoarding up capital in the lands on that
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is easy to see that we are doomed to be
dwarfed in national importance and not
[SPEAKER_00]: many years can pass away before our ships
will be laden with grain, not on their
[SPEAKER_00]: outward, but homeward voyage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with cheap bread, he says,
then with cheap bread no longer peculiar
[SPEAKER_00]: to America, our free institutions may be
thought too dear by those of whom even
[SPEAKER_00]: empires are not worthy, the men with
hearts, hands, and brains vainly looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to our shores for life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the grand political rhetoric,
of course, we expect to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we begin to hear, of course,
here is the argument for land-grant
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also hear is what their work
is, what their job is, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences of their jobs, what the
meaning and significance of their work is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is centered mostly around
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has an ecological dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a historian from Yale named
Stephen Stoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's written a really beautiful book
called The Larding of the Lean Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeously written history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It traces the evolution of the
sustainability ethic in the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a presence by the time he's
making the statement of some really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: ecological thinking about, and many of you
know this, I'm sure better than me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of soil science, the history
of this kind of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would create Rachel Carson by a
century ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred years, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to see this in his rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's one other little thing that he
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just give you a little nugget of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think Morrill did is he painted
a picture of what was happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really almost all negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really pretty much all negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: He then made this prophecy of the doom,
which he used this really apocalyptic
[SPEAKER_00]: phrase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about skeletons and starvation,
mass starvation and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he said, but here's the way we
can fix all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his answer, this is somewhat,
for those of you, all this mythology about
[SPEAKER_00]: people like Morrill and the Land-Grant
Act, people make, frankly, they just make
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go back and actually read,
because everybody thinks, yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was for education.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he was for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he was talking about was the
answer is science, not education.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked about education, but frankly,
it was about science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also said he, like everybody who's
complicated, he said contradictory things
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said a lot of things about
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one little glimpse into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of what he said is that government
should aim not only to elevate and build
[SPEAKER_00]: up a nation that is great in its resources
of wealth and power, but greatest of all
[SPEAKER_00]: in the aggregate of its intelligence and
virtue.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that efforts should be made to
satisfy and elevate the manhood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that word was in italics, of the mass
of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Statesmen and legislators, he said,
should aid to elevate the class upon whom
[SPEAKER_00]: they lean for support and upon whom they
depend for their audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also said that every nation should not
only be giving, should be giving all men,
[SPEAKER_00]: must succeed not only in giving all men,
quote, an opportunity by their own labor
[SPEAKER_00]: to obtain a substantial support,
but also a higher and possibly more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult task, which is to combine the
largest freedom with the largest rewards
[SPEAKER_00]: of labor, free government and personal
independence, something that Morrill
[SPEAKER_00]: argued was key to securing, quote,
the immortality of our republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not just talking about economics,
he's not just talking about soil depletion
[SPEAKER_00]: and ecology, he's talking about something
we would have to put under the category of
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, political culture, political
ideals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of making sense of these anecdotes
is going back and understanding the ways
[SPEAKER_00]: in which the people who built these
institutions, worked at these
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions, who were political advocates
for these institutions, understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were supposed to be about,
what their work was supposed to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we find in Morrill, science as the
centerpiece of the positive thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to contribute to the world,
but we also find all this stuff about,
[SPEAKER_00]: in those days there was, this gets into
the weeds with political theory,
[SPEAKER_00]: but republicanism was the political
philosophy, the public philosophy that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people worked out of, not
democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Democracy was still emerging as an idea
that was seen positively, many of you may
[SPEAKER_00]: know that Plato rejected democracy,
thought it was a really terrible thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was actually asking the mob to rule,
you know, was asking for mob rule,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he rejected that, and the founders of
this country also rejected democracy,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted instead a representative
republic, and so they were grounded in
[SPEAKER_00]: this philosophy that scholars refer to as
republicanism, civic republicanism is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the strengths and strains of that,
Morrill was in that category, and so he
[SPEAKER_00]: paid attention to what he referred to as
virtue, and I will say to you that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the reasons why the Morrill Act has
the sentence in it that talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: liberal and practical education for the
industrial classes, that word liberal
[SPEAKER_00]: signified that the education was not to be
narrowly technical, or practical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but liberal and practical, for reasons
that had to do with the understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to be educating and helping to
create citizens in these days in a
[SPEAKER_00]: republic, not just technicians,
and here is where my next piece in the
[SPEAKER_00]: history comes in, and I'm going to be done
with the history, and this comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberty Hyde Bailey, because there's this,
it's situating these artifacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: one historical trajectory is this whole
thing about the land grant institution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, sorry, the whole thing about soil
exhaustion, about all the things that had
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with bad farming, and science is the
key, but the other historical grand
[SPEAKER_00]: narrative that we need to situate those
artifacts in is a narrative about
[SPEAKER_00]: oppression, and freedom, and liberty,
and self-rule, and the word we use a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: today, democracy, and nobody has spoken to
this more eloquently and concisely than I
[SPEAKER_00]: have found in the period I'm looking at
than Liberty Hyde Bailey, and he did so in
[SPEAKER_00]: many places, but the most eloquently in
his book that was just republished last
[SPEAKER_00]: year for its 100th anniversary,
The Holy Earth, his 1915 book,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a passage in that book,
section in the book, I think it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: The Agriculture and the Democratic Basis,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've erased out the header of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Bailey wrote in this passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This again brings us something into view
that is absolutely essential for
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting the median significance of a
Farm Bureau creed artifact and the Ruby
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Smith artifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what Bailey said.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years without number, for years that
run into the centuries when men have
[SPEAKER_00]: slaughtered men, sorry, when men have
slaughtered each other on many fields
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that they were on the fields of
honor, when many awful despotisms have
[SPEAKER_00]: ground men into the dust, the despotisms
thinking themselves divine, for all these
[SPEAKER_00]: years there have been men on the land
wishing to see the light, trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind here, hoping but never realizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been the pawns on the great
battlefield, men taken out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: peasantries to be hurled against other men
they did not know, and for no rewards
[SPEAKER_00]: except further enslavement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this next sentence goes right to
Justin Morrill in the Land Grant Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may even have been developed to a
high degree of manual or technical skill
[SPEAKER_00]: that they might better support governments
to make conquests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, they have been on the
bottom, upholding the whole superstructure
[SPEAKER_00]: and pressed into the earth by the weight
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Bailey in 1915 giving us a
sweeping view of thousands of years of
[SPEAKER_00]: human history and the farmer, the person
on the bottom, the peasant, the oppression
[SPEAKER_00]: of that person used by governments,
used by kings, maybe even trained
[SPEAKER_00]: technically in laboratories, in
universities, in colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he says, and he's telling a story
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bailey is doing a grand prophetic
narrative piece of work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, the 19th century brought a
parting of the ways in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: that foretold the end of this terrible
story of oppression, narrative oppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: During this time, Bailey wrote,
farmers and others at the bottom began to
[SPEAKER_00]: receive recognition not only for their
economic value of their work, but also and
[SPEAKER_00]: according to Bailey, most importantly,
for their humanity and dignity and their
[SPEAKER_00]: agency in standing as citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: In his view, this multi-dimensional
recognition was what inspired the creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of the United States Department of
Agriculture in 1862, land grant colleges
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1862, agricultural experiment stations
in 1887, and finally, the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Cooperative Extension System in 1914.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quoting Bailey, quote, a new agency has
been created in the Agricultural Extension
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, which was signed by President Wilson
on the 8th of May in 1914.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new instrumentality in the world has now
received the sanction of a whole people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it almost staggers one when one even
partly comprehends the tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences that in all likelihood will
come of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he, conceptualizing extension work in
political rather than narrowly technical
[SPEAKER_00]: terms, he pointed to the problem of
relating, quote, in Bailey's words,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this public work to the development of
a democracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not thinking so much of the
development of a form of government.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of a real democratic expression on the
part of a people, agricultural is our
[SPEAKER_00]: basic industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we organize its affairs, so to a great
degree shall we secure the results in
[SPEAKER_00]: society in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Bailey went on to talk about
higher education, and he said higher
[SPEAKER_00]: education's engagement with farmers needed
to take the form of a democratic
[SPEAKER_00]: association that is deeply educative.
[SPEAKER_00]: For him, it was imperative that,
quote, education should result or function
[SPEAKER_00]: politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ex-dean of a college of
agriculture, this college of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps as an ex-dean, he said these kinds
of things when he was still the dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 1915.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education should result or function
politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the kind of education that
should be provided by land-grant colleges
[SPEAKER_00]: of agriculture, Bailey wrote, and this
goes right back to Justin Morrill,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is Bailey interpreting the meaning
and significance of the land-grant act of
[SPEAKER_00]: liberal and practical education,
of his role as a scientist, of the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: others of his colleagues in this
institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I interpret what he's doing
when he wrote this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not sufficient to train technically
in the trades and crafts and arts to the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of securing greater economic
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be accomplished in a despotism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And result in no self-action on the part
of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every democracy must reach far beyond what
is commonly known as economic efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and do everything it can to enable those
in the backgrounds to maintain their
[SPEAKER_00]: standing and their pride and to partake in
the making of political affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you can't hear the Farm Bureau
Creed's words resonating in that quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can't hear what Ruby Green Smith
said resonating in that quote,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go back and read them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are discovering something here
that's really interesting that speaks to
[SPEAKER_00]: these normative questions of the role.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is anti-science.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this is against scientists doing
work in laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bailey was a fierce defender of what
we would call basic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fierce defender of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pushed back very hard against what he
would call thought of as the totally
[SPEAKER_00]: irresponsible demand by politicians and by
the public that everything scientists did
[SPEAKER_00]: at these institutions have immediate
practical usability.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pushed back very hard against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he said every creation of
knowledge is a contribution to our
[SPEAKER_00]: commonwealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other reasons why he was
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got years of work I'm doing in
interpreting all this and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop this idea out of this history and
heritage of thinking and work going back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the 19th century.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes into the present,
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want to, so I want to
quote you for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before quoting you, so I and students
and I have done a lot of, I've become
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinated with all of this not just as
some thing to read in the archives.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are no longer living.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wondering, wow, all of this is in the
DNA of these institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if that's still happening today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if, do we have people saying
similar things who are scientists like
[SPEAKER_00]: Bailey was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or administrators?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are people, how do people today talk
about their work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the work that scientists at
institutions like Cornell are doing when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're out beyond the campus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been spending years doing these
oral history interviews, finding engaged
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and inviting them to sell
stories about their work and experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: about their lives, how they became an
engaged scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I published several books of
collections of these things with analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: and interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites, which is unpublished
because Don won't let me publish it yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a weed scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of your friends, maybe, named Don
Weiss from the University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know Don Weiss?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Don Weiss?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to read a couple of
passages from his profile, which begins to
[SPEAKER_00]: help us move beyond just kind of the idea
of civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does it look like in practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the elements of practice in civic
science?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do civic scientists do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck am I talking about,
basically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond some philosophical thing that has
grandiose-ness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's two passages I want to read from
Don's profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I invite him to tell his life story.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you end up as a weed scientist at
the University of Minnesota?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you grow up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he grew up as a Mennonite on a farm in
Ohio, raised by Mennonite parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he got all the way to the place in his
story where he was talking about his
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the job at the University of
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll read you just a passage from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I arrived here at the University of
Minnesota, which was in 1974, when I
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived here at the University of
Minnesota, the position I got had two
[SPEAKER_00]: obligations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an 80-20 split, 20% teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant I would be teaching two
courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: My primary responsibility in teaching was
to teach the undergrad weed management
[SPEAKER_00]: course.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, the student population was
about 80 to 120 students.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other obligation, which I found very
intriguing, was the 80% research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no extension or outreach component
officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result, the research component,
was to work on perennial weed management
[SPEAKER_00]: in grass seed production in northern
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I did have the opportunity to
work on perennial weed management and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cropping systems statewide,
my primary responsibility was to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: a group of farmers in Roseau and Lake of
the Woods counties and a series of other
[SPEAKER_00]: bordering counties on perennial weed
management in legume and seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The University of Minnesota College of
Agriculture, specifically the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Agronomy and Plant Genetics,
had developed a relationship with the area
[SPEAKER_00]: of the state that goes back a number of
years, probably back to the late 40s and
[SPEAKER_00]: early 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a group of scientists from the
St. Paul campus who were breeding grasses
[SPEAKER_00]: and legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happened that, at the time,
some students from northern Minnesota were
[SPEAKER_00]: attending the St. Paul campus and had been
taking some courses and learned about
[SPEAKER_00]: these breeding programs and found that one
of the faculty had developed a series of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way out of my depth here talking about
what he's talking about, so I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: reading you what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was called Park Kentucky
bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the interaction that the faculty
members had with the students from that
[SPEAKER_00]: area of the state, they decided that they
would try some of these grasses in
[SPEAKER_00]: northern Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the climate was ideal for growth
and development of Kentucky bluegrass,
[SPEAKER_00]: plus the community and these students were
interested in bringing that crop to the
[SPEAKER_00]: area of the state because of the riskiness
in producing annual crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the late 40s, this relationship
developed and Kentucky bluegrass seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production started in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: My position was created as a result of
trying to expand grass legume seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production to other species other than
Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he talks about the problem with
expanding that, the reason they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: that person to deal with that problem had
to do with reducing the risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he says, a group of farmers had
organized called the Northern Minnesota
[SPEAKER_00]: bluegrass producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They developed around this initial
opportunity created by the university to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce Kentucky bluegrass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then wanted to move forward to create
new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had organized to ask the experiment
station and through the experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: station, the legislature to create this
new position, his faculty position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was pretty well set up ahead of time
that the core group that I would interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with in northern Minnesota was this
loose-knit group of seed producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I interviewed at the University of
Minnesota, I interviewed not only on this
[SPEAKER_00]: campus, I interviewed them on the campus,
but I also interviewed with those farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: and those farmers had direct input into my
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't develop this network.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was brought in as part of this network
that had developed years before my
[SPEAKER_00]: arrival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was brought in as one who could fit into
that philosophy and be willing to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: that community and help them develop these
new economic opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a little glimpse of the
historical reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little moment in time, one person's
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've researched across institutions
around the country, this is again in the
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA of these colleges, this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a scientist whose whole position is
grounded and defined in relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: specific place, specific people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what becomes important is what is Don's
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Don is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a director of MISA, the Minnesota
Institute for Sustainable Agriculture when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a real smart ass joker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has the habit of always saying,
I'm just a weed scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's not just a weed scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fiercely engaged in the world and in
his field and the institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a philosopher.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a civic educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to read one more passage,
a brief passage that begins to give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: glimpse into his practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm naming this as civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can name it anything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm naming it as civic science with
respect to this whole set of discoveries
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm making and the tools I'm using to
analyze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just giving us now a little
glimpse into what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each spring, we, not just my project,
but Nancy Elke, who is one of his other
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, fly to northern Minnesota and
spend two days with the farmers and other
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to emphasize that the network of
people that supports the grass seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are university personnel,
extension within northern Minnesota,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as bankers, processors,
and community members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very broad set of players who
are active in helping set the agenda and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing leadership for the research and
education program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each spring in March, we get together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through a two-day discussion,
which is made up of presentations,
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, and future planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the research agenda that I carry out is
not just my research agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a research agenda that has been
developed, I would say even approved,
[SPEAKER_00]: by this network of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes my obligation to carry out that
work in partnership with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as to report back to them,
help facilitate the conversation around
[SPEAKER_00]: results, and help them provide the
leadership for taking next steps and the
[SPEAKER_00]: next series of research questions,
which should then be carried out to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's a wide range of
interests in that setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have individuals who want to sell
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would like to see cropping systems
develop that use a certain specific
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could make a profit selling those
inputs, such as herbicides, fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a set of processors and marketers
who are interested in getting seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer to process, charging the farmer
for processing and then taking the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and marketing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the farmers who want to control
the processing and want to have a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of the pie of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a full array of interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically comes down to facilitating
this group of people in a way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to remember why they are doing
this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This work is being done to add stability
to that community to really develop
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the conversations that we've had over
the years really come back when these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues develop to remind them of what
we're trying to accomplish together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been part of my primary
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remind them why they created these
positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elling's position, Nancy's position,
the Elkie's position and my position in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have told them that and had that open up
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a group that allows that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remind them that many of them are in
that community because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship that has developed between
that community and the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that came out when I said to Don,
because I knew him, you're just a
[SPEAKER_00]: technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a weed scientist technician.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you do is you go out to the community
with a clipboard and you say, what are
[SPEAKER_00]: your problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go back to your lab and you
just cook up the answers and then you give
[SPEAKER_00]: them to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes use this strategy in doing
interviews, only after I build some level
[SPEAKER_00]: of trust because it's disrespectful if you
don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew, I knew because I knew him,
that that was not all he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, that he is not just a technician
with a clipboard and you hear it in his
[SPEAKER_00]: response.
[SPEAKER_00]: He reminds them of why are we here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's conscious of the differences in
interests and for God's sake, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time I discovered that weed
scientists were civic educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they knew that it's ingrained in him
and it comes, this goes all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through the history of these institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, none of this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deeply flawed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Weiss is not some perfection heroic
figure up on a pedestal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this is imperfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incompletely done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's messy and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see here is a practice of
civic science in which scientists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the way, Don has produced hundreds
and hundreds of published articles in the
[SPEAKER_00]: top journals in his field and gotten
hundreds of millions of dollars of
[SPEAKER_00]: funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not either you do this stuff or
you do the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an either or.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that Don does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have partners who do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have the extension
facilitators in the local community.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an ecology that's required to do
this civic science work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to get into my closing here
to just say, out of what I've,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in the middle of this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of dumping out all this stuff
that I'm discovering and trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of it in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly what emerges from this are a
set of challenges and questions that I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to name very briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, of course, that a lot of
people name when thinking about this
[SPEAKER_00]: tradition of work in land-grant colleges
is money, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at Cornell since 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Heidi in the back and others
in this room can tell you who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: here longer than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lost faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lost capacity in this institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work with people in the state of New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost it in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've lost it in a lot of other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public disinvestment in higher education
has eroded the tradition of civic science,
[SPEAKER_00]: of scientific work engaged with,
like Don's work, and Don tells a story
[SPEAKER_00]: about when he started his job,
all the money he got from the experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: station and it was enough as he put it to
run a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could run a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He could open a lab up on what he got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he talks about how today you
don't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to go to industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that opens up a whole set of
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So money is an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Public disinvestment, loss of capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this isn't just about capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just going to give you the tip
of a very big, complex, and deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: contested, deeply,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say controversial, but it's
controversial for a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So divisive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the way that scientists are
trained, the political influences on
[SPEAKER_00]: science and scientific institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a woman named Stephanie Lee who is
a development scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an anthropologist, done a lot of
work in Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wrote a book called The Will to
Improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called The Will to Improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she talked about two practices that
are central to the realm of development
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, land grant work is
development work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 19th century, what they were doing
is they're trying to change the way
[SPEAKER_00]: farming is being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to change the way people
are eating, change the way people are
[SPEAKER_00]: raising their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's development work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is identified in her work,
both of which are anti-civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're parallel, they're companion
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them she refers to as rendering
technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one she refers to as
rendering non-political.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize a very complex story,
what this means is you come into a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that is multi-dimensional.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about the two northern counties
in northern Minnesota that we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: glimpse of in Don's passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of political and
cultural and economic things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process of rendering technical is
to strip all that out and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a problem of politics up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a problem of technical
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And surprise, when you do that,
then the technician is able to provide the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I got the answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you leave the politics and stuff in,
they don't have the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do this, when you render
something technical, when you render it
[SPEAKER_00]: non-political, you simplify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simplify it too much, you have
suddenly produced a real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your intervention is going to be a
real problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said this is divisive or controversial
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically pointing the finger at
institutions like our college.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do the history and stuff,
you can see the ways in which the college,
[SPEAKER_00]: this big expanse of thinking of Bailey and
Ruby Green Smith has flattened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't hear this kind of stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all kinds of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about people being bad
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a complicated thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we do in my field of really
trying to understand and use robust tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another reality that's really
important is that we don't have very good
[SPEAKER_00]: public cultures in these colleges or in
our fields for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we do is based on a theory
of change, bets we're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do these things, this will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we disseminate information,
parents will raise their kids better or
[SPEAKER_00]: eat better or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those theories of change need to be
subject to critical evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well is that working out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have very good public cultures in
these institutions where we create spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: to really engage around this or to hold
each other accountable for more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: the technical piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pushes against cultures in
disciplines and fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of reasons why this is a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a problem with overly
ideological politics and morally righteous
[SPEAKER_00]: politics, which tends to polarize these
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I come right back to the election
where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of creating a space where we can
hear across lines of difference and speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to it respectfully but also critically,
we have a zero sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people are totally right and good
and these people are totally bad and evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is death to civic science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because civic science is really grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where my own bias comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of democratic populist politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little glimpse into all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went too long and I'm sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's first of all thank Scott.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
