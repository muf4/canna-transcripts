[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Jeff and the faculty for
inviting me to speak today in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and genetics seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is I will be
talking to you about international
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships in crop improvement,
the lessons which we have learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, going forward, what would
be the lessons and how do we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: develop successful partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to illustrate, what I will do is I'll
take three geographies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be Latin America, then Africa
and Asia, explain to you of three current
[SPEAKER_00]: projects which are ongoing, and then talk
to you about experiential learning
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, what we would call as capacity
development programs, which have a direct
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this partnership, which I will be
talking to you today, it involves a
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership between several Cornell
faculty, students, developing countries in
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to talk first is how
exactly do we develop successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable international partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, you know, expanding the global
footprint of Cornell and CALS in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular requires creating international
partnerships which are truly sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on my, you know, as Ronnie
mentioned, you know, I worked with CG
[SPEAKER_00]: centers and now with Cornell for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on my own current experience in
terms of developing these partnerships,
[SPEAKER_00]: I find about five major factors which we
need to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it is very important for us to
identify the best suitable partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: A suitable partner is one who fits with
the profile of Cornell, plant breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to be doing with plant
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to fit with the mandate and profile
of our own institutions, our objectives,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it should be complementary and
compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be a shared understanding of
the long and short term expectations of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and of the partnership itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important, you know,
as we begin in a partnership, who could
[SPEAKER_00]: this partner be where we could share a
common vision?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in India, several years back,
we identified Sadhguru, which has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: major partner not only for me but for all
of IP CALS work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Indian Council for Agriculture
Research, which is ICAR, and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, you know, no U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: land grant has a MOU with ICAR without a
sort of a termination date.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have IP CALS has an agreement which
is never ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on the mutual consent of
partners, we can break the contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: MIKO, which is a very large vegetable seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these would be the three big partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there are state agriculture
universities and seed companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, but I'm not going to list them
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Bangladesh, for the last seven
years, several years, we have been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with Bangladesh Agricultural Research
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Philippines, it's UPLV, and in Malawi,
we have the Delongwe University for
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural and Agricultural Resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Mexico, we have University of
Choppingo and INIFAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the second important thing is
identifying shared goals and policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is arrived at when there is a strong
leader in each institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these leaders at each
institution should be able to negotiate
[SPEAKER_00]: and come to a common understanding as to
how these partnerships are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: carried forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So developing a shared vision,
need for shared goals, and shared policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third important thing is how do you
get an institutional commitment between
[SPEAKER_00]: the partners?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's an MOU, a Memorandum of
Agreement, which is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this can take quite a bit of
time, but it's very useful to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: common understanding as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the fourth thing is long-term
commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a long-term commitment
that is institutionalized at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you are working with ICR or
if you are working with any other large
[SPEAKER_00]: national program, this needs to be
institutionalized at a very high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dissemination of the project
results have to be made available via a
[SPEAKER_00]: website, social media, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to demonstrate the positiveness
of any partnership, which we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not necessary, you know,
that when we are creating this
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership, people talk about financial
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is more important is that the
partnership may end after, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the grant has ended, but the people who
are involved in this partnership can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: it forward because they are motivated and
there's academic interest at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does not need to be always
money-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Establishing a partnership, you know,
it takes long and long-term commitment is
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: At both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, you know, when you're
creating a partnership, it's more like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can compare it to a
marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one needs to know the expectations of
your partner, and the partner needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: all partners need to understand,
you know, how do they need to operate,
[SPEAKER_00]: really on the basis of what we would say
equality and complementarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all need to be willing to make it
really last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So managing and helping partners for
example with difficult situations is also
[SPEAKER_00]: very critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me give you a case of BT eggplant
project, you know, where all the partners
[SPEAKER_00]: were sued by the High Court in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if Cornell had dropped out of that
whole partnership, the whole project would
[SPEAKER_00]: have collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rani, in fact, had to go all the way up
to the Prime Minister of India to indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: the technical backstopping which Cornell
had in terms of the science, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the training, in terms of the capacity
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a leadership at Cornell and to patch
things makes it really very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, so one is, you know, you're looking
at how do you really create partnerships?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of effort and very
energy-intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is, you know, let's look at what
is the donor perspective when it really
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to plant breeding or crop
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many of the projects, you know,
which we have worked, a majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: international development projects now
focus on promoting crop improvement in
[SPEAKER_00]: what we call in an agricultural
innovations paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these innovation paradigm includes
partnerships, which includes multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop improvement has to be addressed in an
innovation system, and what donors are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for is what is the knowledge,
what is the culture, and how are new ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: promoted within this innovation paradigm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So partnership between actors is really
critical, I would say essential,
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the demands of the principal
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing what we find very
important is when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple projects and international
partners, you need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-stakeholder collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a private sector, it could be
an NGO, it could be a university,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you create this strong
collaborative program in order to carry on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the donors' perspectives?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a strong focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most donors want a buy-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would give you a startup grant,
and then they would tell you to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: other donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what is important is you
might have all these factors, and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could be bringing the whole thing
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can devote a lot of time, and you
could submit a proposal to end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: refused.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a lot of failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that, you know, we've been very
successful with every proposal which we
[SPEAKER_00]: have submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you know, Cornell has
never been successful in bringing to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell what we would call Feed the Future
Innovation Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: These would be the collaborative research
support programs which many of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: land grants, you know, our competitors
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the best project,
but what we find is sometimes politics and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other factors such as, you know,
funding, et cetera, you know, indirect
[SPEAKER_00]: costs coming to play, and we might lose
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we may win the project,
but then depending on which donor,
[SPEAKER_00]: things may not go really smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balancing the ever-changing demands of the
donor and keeping partners motivated is
[SPEAKER_00]: very crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can give you, you know, I could have
given you a talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the experiences and some of the
challenges which we have had in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: these partnerships, but let me give you
one example here of USAID.
[SPEAKER_00]: USAID initially, you know, gave a huge
project in biotechnology, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: AgBioTech support project, in order to
commercialize products in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the project was initiated,
that was the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But later on, the focus changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes in management, the focus
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, from commercialization,
it went off to regulatory and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: other different issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in today's talk, what I thought is I'll
focus on a few examples of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: large international partnerships in crop
improvement, give you a brief update,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the lessons, and I hope I can
do that within sort of 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be rushing through now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rani talked about this partnership,
and I can tell you this has been the best
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people probably think it's all gone,
but just before coming, I was talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA guys, John Bamberg and Chuck
Brown, and they're all interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're actually using the Toluca site
in order to test the potato germplasm for
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this project was started when I was
in the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was initially about $6 million,
and it has gone to close to $10 million
[SPEAKER_00]: now, with funding coming in from other
donors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A major donor was Atlantic Philanthropies.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it was our anonymous donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa was the chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for supporting me at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, Lisa, you'll be happy to know that
this project is still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wallace Genetic Foundation is
interested in funding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Lay and USDA and others are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chuck Brown, who is the potato breeder,
he's been extensively using the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rebecca Nelson, when she was at CEP,
they did the external review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of about five years,
what did the external review find?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, well, you know, seeing whether
it continues or not, it is a sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: The partnership will continue with or
without funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really very crucial for
us because right now what we see is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the activities which are promoted through
SIEM in order to reduce the late blight in
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world, but we wanted to use
three partners, which was Eastern Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main need for it was, you know,
aggressive strains of phytophthora
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A potential for this disease to initiate
earlier, shortage of fungicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lack of widely accepted sort of
resistant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go through quickly, why did we get
involved in this partnership?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell, when we got started, had probably
one of the largest concentration of potato
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Bob and Walter were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had good potato breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Fry had a very active program.
[SPEAKER_00]: On late blight dispersal and looking at
the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Steve Slack here, who was working
on disease-free seed potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Elmer Ewing, who was working on
potato physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Bill Brody, who was working on
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a very good program on
biotechnology, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a really good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that team really got motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So faculty interest was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we get involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got involved in Toluca, and we are
still involved in Toluca.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Toluca is the late blight ancestral
home, just like, you know, the wheat rust
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in Nijoro, you have all the
screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Toluca, we have a site which is
managed by Inifap and by Shapingo,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are still looking at the fungal
population, the pathology, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great site for utilization by
global researchers all over the world in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to screen the, I would say,
varieties for resistance to this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just forgot to mention, in Toluca,
the reason we also got involved is because
[SPEAKER_00]: John Niederhauser, you know, who is a
Cornell alum, and he had worked with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for years with Norman Bullock in
Toluca, looking at late blight resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So John had come in as one of the advisors
for SIEM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had also had a parallel project in
Mexico called the Potato Late Blight
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing Program, or PICTIPAPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other connection was Eastern
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia and Poland still have problems with
late blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And losses by late blight were very huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they needed access to some of the
germplasm, as well as access to some
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potatoes is considered as a second
bread there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Late blight is a major constraint,
source of important germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a strong breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring all these factors together,
and you look at what is it that SIEM can
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bill Fry was able to locate about two
post-docs, a couple of students in Toluca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to get some really great
research done in terms of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were able to do several capacity
development programs and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I say, the activities still
continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outcomes have been resistant
cultivars, understanding the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, availability of the Toluca site as
a global site for research and for
[SPEAKER_00]: commercialization of late blight resistant
varieties, and looking at factors of
[SPEAKER_00]: epidemiology and understanding how to
promote effective IPM or integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The project also gave an opportunity for
Cornell to enter into Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the varieties, like seven
varieties, which were developed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been transferred to Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these include Reba, Salem,
Kyoka Gold, Eva, Pike, and New York 128.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great achievement for the,
I would say, the unit now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these varieties are now being promoted
in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing which has been really,
really great for ABSP2, which will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next project I'll show you, is that some
of the work which we early did in Toluca,
[SPEAKER_00]: Toluca was the first site to identify what
we would say durable resistance in a wild
[SPEAKER_00]: species, which is mentioned here,
Solanum bulbocastanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has durable resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gene from this has been identified
by research researchers in Wisconsin and
[SPEAKER_00]: in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gene has been transferred into
the ABSP2 project in order to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: transgenic potato cultivars with the RB
gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So durable resistance, which has been
found through this project, was extended
[SPEAKER_00]: into another project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what lessons did we learn through this
partnership?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very important to identify the
right partners to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also important to get the donors on
board and establish this linkage,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the faculty and students involved in
order to get this partnership going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me talk a little bit about the
next project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been in three areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is in South Asia, Southeast Asia,
and Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the countries which,
I was involved in India and Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one of the associate directors of this
project for about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main focus here is to
commercialize bioengineered crops in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were looking at a concept called
product commercialization packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proposal initially was developed
with the leadership of Ronnie and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was initially funded for about 34
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total 15 million coming from USAID and 15
million coming from the missions and 4
[SPEAKER_00]: million as matching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the five years, there was a
review and it was extended for another six
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the total funding in about 11 years was
over $60 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, as we began this big global
partnership, probably the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural biotechnology project
implemented in any US land grant or for
[SPEAKER_00]: that matter, in any of the developed or
developing countries, involved about 47
[SPEAKER_00]: partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have national and regional
partners, US universities, private sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: CGIAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got about six CGIAR centers,
NGOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can imagine when you have 47
partners, and I'm sure this is happening
[SPEAKER_00]: with the genetic gains and wheat
improvement project as well, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have lots of partners, you have to deal
what we call as subcontracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had at one time 20 subcontracts to
about 20 different institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every subcontract, you have to manage
them and you have to report them to USAID
[SPEAKER_00]: on a quarterly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to travel around the world in
order to manage the partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the strategic approach is product
development or product commercialization
[SPEAKER_00]: packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Priority setting workshops are done
locally in every different country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the products are identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you work with the public sector and
you work with the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the private sector to license you
the technologies on a royalty free basis
[SPEAKER_00]: for small farmers in developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the key to the success of what
we would say the commercialization of
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as many of you know, after 11 years
of this project, the BT eggplant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was genetically engineered to
bacillus thuringiensis, and which can
[SPEAKER_00]: resist the fruit and shoot border,
which is shown in the insert here,
[SPEAKER_00]: in South Asia, typically farmers spray
over 70 times per season.
[SPEAKER_00]: BT eggplant was developed in collaboration
with collaborators or partners in India,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Philippines, and Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ABSP2 in itself ended in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, based on the progress of what we
had done in ABSP2, Cornell got another
[SPEAKER_00]: award for three years, which is now headed
by Tony Shelton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this newly funded project under the
Feed the Future South Asia Eggplant
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvement Project is about 4.8 million
for three years to improve food security
[SPEAKER_00]: using agricultural science and
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is very important is, one is the
science, but the other thing is getting
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment at the highest political level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you see here with the green sari is
Matia Chowdhury, the woman with the green
[SPEAKER_00]: sari here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it were not for her, I would say
that this product would probably not have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the light of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science was there, everything was
there, but it was in 2013 when she really
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneered the commercial release of BT
eggplant in Bangladesh, in spite of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of opposition from NGOs and also from
partners in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these varieties which have been
released, there are over 6,000 farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: which are growing, and farmers are
realizing increasingly sort of marketable
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is important from this
partnership is that it is focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, it relies on multidisciplinary
partnership, and it has a strong component
[SPEAKER_00]: of communications, advocacy, and speaking
up for science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Sarah has been involved in this
partnership, and it has been great that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has been going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'll switch back to the RB gene,
which was initially identified as a
[SPEAKER_00]: durable resistance in the Toluca Valley
through the STEAM project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we were able to actually get the
results and convince USAID that this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a product which could be of great
benefit to Bangladesh, India, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene comes from the diploid potato,
which is Solanum Bulbocastanum,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has shown durability since 1953.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a race, non-specific, major gene,
and the species is also pretty resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to nematodes and verticillium wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put a partnership together in ABSP2,
and this included partners from South
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, Indonesia, as well as Bangladesh and
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see Luis Siqueira here on the
right side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was also a good, important partner
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to do both direct
transformation as well as take transgenic
[SPEAKER_00]: Kataden, one of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, and use it in a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the events from that are now being
carried forward, and Indonesia has done
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of multi-location trials,
and from the latest news which we have is
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesia, without the support of any
granting organization, they are going on
[SPEAKER_00]: their own, they have developed the food
safety dossier, and if we are lucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: the government itself would be releasing
this cultivar hopefully next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, several people asked me
about this USAID project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, KV, you're involved in this USAID
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: What benefits has it really brought to
Cornell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
what is it that Cornell gains out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought I'm going to very quickly
show you what is it that Cornell has
[SPEAKER_00]: gained out of this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you know, when we put this
project with USAID, there was no money
[SPEAKER_00]: allocated there for actually support of
graduate students or faculty research,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, it was a long battle in
order to convince them the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: actually this kind of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we had PhD students here,
Travis Leibert, who did his PhD on looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at the value of propo or seeds of BT in
the context of farmers in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a PhD student, and I was in the
committee of this student as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the impact assessment of BT
eggplant in India between hybrids versus
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollinated seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at Ray Wu, who was working on
rice for drought and salt tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a three-year funding which was
given to him in order to look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fusion gene here, you know, the TPSP
fusion gene in order to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: drought-tolerant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visiting scientists from developing
countries were supported to be in Ray's
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the goal was to develop
marker-free plants of indica, IR64.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gene constructs which Ray was working
were facilitated to be licensed with a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-time fee, which came to CCTEC here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all benefits all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molly John, you know, got a big contract
to look at multiple virus-resistant tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walter de Jong got potato transformation
using RNAi construct for testing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tony Shelton got, you know,
some support for developing
[SPEAKER_00]: insect-resistant management strategies and
communication guides like Jim Shanahan on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to develop effective strategies for GE
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what lessons did we learn from one of
these big major partnerships?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is, you know, through selected,
what we would say, activities,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could achieve great progress provided
we have a strong partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is also important is that the
priorities within USAID, you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: the funding, but they could change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to be sensitive to the U.S.,
what we would say, push factor in many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these supportive countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are caught in between what I would
say, you know, the changing priorities
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the priorities of the local
partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the developing countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to be understanding is we
need to enable local champions because at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end, you know, it's the locals who are
going to be stewarding and taking this
[SPEAKER_00]: product forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, very quickly, I'll go through what is
called the Agricultural Innovation
[SPEAKER_00]: Partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another large contract which we
won through USAID, very, very competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: land grants bid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trilateral partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Obama was our president, he had gone
with Raj Shah to India, and there they
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out, you know, the best strategy
is to connect U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: land grants with India where the Green
Revolution happened and then take it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a trilateral collaboration between
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: land grants, between developing countries
in Asia, India being the prime,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then transferring that to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you develop partnerships?
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought in University of Illinois
because they had great work in the area of
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio State because they were doing some
great work in Africa as well as in Asia in
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Georgia, they were working
on food processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuskegee University, they were doing some
animal science work.
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis, they had an effective
horticulture program in Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you connect these dots, and then you
connect what you would say in developing
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that the pioneering agricultural
institutions and, you know, USAID has
[SPEAKER_00]: already told you that you need to work in
the northeast of India where the per
[SPEAKER_00]: capita income is less than $1.25 per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to focus in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three geographies, India, Nepal,
and at the end, Africa, we looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the different engagements here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are two different big components
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is how do you improve the agricultural
curriculum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, how do you generate
agricultural graduates who are market
[SPEAKER_00]: ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to look at how do you introduce
new curricula?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you bring in diploma programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you develop experiential learning
modules?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you establish an office for Center
for Technology Transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So technical expertise for all these 12
different areas, we had to grow across the
[SPEAKER_00]: campus, across the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to identify the resource people,
get them engaged in this partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the proposed activities were
implemented in a five-year period in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funding was for three years,
and in Malawi, it was for four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just shrink this, and I'm going
to show you a short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can escape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I play this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this partnership, by the way,
can you just hear it play?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the important things in this
partnership is it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer-oriented, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm going to show you a short
video where I was there about two months
[SPEAKER_00]: back in one of our partner institutions,
which is the University of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences in Dharwad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to be visiting Ronnie,
me, and Max, and a couple of us are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be going there in January, where we are
going to be opening the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for Agriculture Development,
and it's going to be called after Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this university has been working with
us for about 20 years, and what they have
[SPEAKER_00]: done is they have reformed the curriculum,
especially in seed science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have started what is called a seed
village program, and farmers are brought
[SPEAKER_00]: every year for a farmer fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a four-day fair where farmers are
actually exposed to different technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: which are developed through partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this fair, the most accepted
technology was the seed technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could not believe it because I was
there and I was told to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 2.4 million farmers in four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to demonstrate, if you can just
take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see they had a drone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were about 1,000 stalls here,
and the maximum number of people who were
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting the stalls were all seed-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them who bought the seed,
they would get two tree saplings to plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which were free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean hundreds of farmers lined up to
buy seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just amazing to see the benefits of
a partnership like this, and what effect
[SPEAKER_00]: it has at the grass-roots level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we are... So what I wanted to
quickly now show you is three other
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships which are related to capacity
development, and what effect does this
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity development have in the
plant-breeding community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this is the seed village model
which we have put together in Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Malawi, where we have connected the
Indian partners to this university,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a coordinator who's based here
in Bunda College.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he is doing, apart from a couple
of other work, is helping the foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: seed or the basic seed improvement
development program there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic seed is then given to the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers produce the certified seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the certified seed is given to the
private company, and then the private
[SPEAKER_00]: company distributes it to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, USAID funded this for four years,
and then after that the project has ended,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you would think that the whole
thing has collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a private company now,
which is going to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be Agra involved in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be Rockefeller.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a couple of other big
donors who are going to be coming forward
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting this partnership to take it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the local buy-in, the local
leadership would actually be taking this
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we really want to make it
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is Rani and myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were there about a month back,
and we are looking at some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities for seed processing,
which we had established in partnership
[SPEAKER_00]: with the local university in India,
where we had worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed is cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basic seed is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you would say, the certified
seed comes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's processed, cleaned, and then made
available to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, very quickly, because I know we are
getting short of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are three other partnerships
which we are dealing with capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is this IARD program, 402 and 602
course, which some of you are familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four groups in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the plant breeding students,
we get an average of about two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come into what we call the
agricultural systems group, which is led
[SPEAKER_00]: by myself, Marvin, and Rani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get one faculty from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have also value addition
infrastructure and fiber science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important with this partnership,
again, is that Cornell students are
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with Indian students right from
the beginning of the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell develops the curriculum.
[SPEAKER_00]: State Agricultural University sends their
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell Sadhguru helps out with what we
would say the logistics, then also some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the funding related issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year is going to be, I mean,
next year is going to be our 50th year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 12,000, 1,200 students who
have participated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the IARD alums who have graduated
are in key positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a higher employment for the
students to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did in IARD, or what we are
doing in IARD, gave birth to a new
[SPEAKER_00]: program, which is the dual degree program
between two universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what would be of interest is
the plant breeding, what dual degree
[SPEAKER_00]: program, which is an MPS program in plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was developed, again,
through this partnership in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop what we would say new generation
of students who can address the emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this program ran for about three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 35 students who have
graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the students who have
graduated, I think, you know, Margaret
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith still has one PhD student and Walter
still has one student.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then I think a couple of students,
Philomena, who graduated from Mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: is now working in Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this partnership has been really
effective, but there have been certain
[SPEAKER_00]: roadblocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a review of this program,
an external review.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came up and they said, well,
you know, they interviewed all the Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty who were involved with this MPS
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Majority of them said, well, we don't want
MPS, we want an MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be research driven,
it should be two years, and etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second challenge was, how do you fulfill
the TOEFL and GRE requirement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the students who are
coming from these countries are from rural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, and they find it extremely hard to
get their GRE at TOEFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a heavy course load at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing a dual degree,
there's 30 credits which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to do here, and they have to do
about 45 credits on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no way that there could be
an exchange of credits between a
[SPEAKER_00]: developing country institution and Cornell
and Cornell and other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cornell said, no, we have to do all the
courses as stipulated by our graduate
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the courses which were done
here, the participating universities
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted the credits, but vice versa was
not accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only big spin-off from this
three-year or 30-student one was that
[SPEAKER_00]: Ronnie and me, we were in constant touch
with Ratan Tata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that was over 10 years,
and then that brought a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: endowment of about 50 million to establish
the Tata Cornell Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are very grateful and happy that,
you know, even though we are not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue this, there is some sort of
influence in this in the sense that other
[SPEAKER_00]: students are benefiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a seed industry program,
which we do, and Cornell land bidding
[SPEAKER_00]: faculty who are involved, you have Dick
Cahoon, you have Alan Taylor, myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: Ronnie, and this is primarily to do with
technology access, licensing issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory issues, market access,
and business restructuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very, very successful course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been running it for over 14 years,
and it's self-funded, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we really don't need any donor support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are other bigger opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working with the World Bank,
and there's an opportunity for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: education in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were out there in Malawi talking to the
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this Afghanistan agriculture input
program for wheat seed improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did send one consultant there for
looking at quarantine issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the India's National Higher
Education Project, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because we were involved with
the development and giving some thought
[SPEAKER_00]: process to it, and this is a huge project
which builds on the previous USAID project
[SPEAKER_00]: which we have worked in India on higher
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that there are
opportunities all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the success, you know, depends on
motivation of the group, how we are
[SPEAKER_00]: linked, donors, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put two donors who really had the
influence on my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one is Mr. Tata and the other one is
Mr. Finney, and here you can see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lessons which we have learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go through because I
think we are running short of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, it has been a great journey
so far, and IP CALS has given me a
[SPEAKER_00]: platform in order to promote some of these
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lessons have been really vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank the majority of the,
you know, people who are here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you all who are here, have been very,
very important, and as we have gone
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with these partnerships,
you have lent a hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Lisa?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we wanted, yeah,
that was a very big negotiation which
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, and Bob placed it who was,
at that time, the main reader,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that I don't believe in,
I want to give this at no royalty or no
[SPEAKER_00]: fee, and it's a public domain,
and I think the Russians are in need of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, so, okay, we go ahead, and we'll sign
off on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it won't happen now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't happen now, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the rice, you know,
the technology of Revu was given to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Susan and me, we had dinner with
the company which was here recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They licensed it on a one-time fee,
and I can't, I mean, I don't know the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact fee, but it was a hefty sum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Pilar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Pilar was involved with us in
actually looking at the women issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the big projects funded by USAID,
but it's very important, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we put these partnerships together,
in view of the time, I could not talk of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other social factors, but looking at
gender and gender issues in agriculture is
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very critical, and in every
quarterly report, you know, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the indicators which you submit to
the donors in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, women issues, I think, you know,
Pilar, you looked at how can curriculum in
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural universities, for example,
in India, be an enhanced by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: women issues, and Pilar has worked there,
and I think you also collaborated with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody in Ohio State to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think, you know, the curriculum as
such, when you're looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: undergraduate level, there were not many
women-related courses, so those were
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated in this partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second was, how do you bring youth
into agriculture, especially women?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we had a program for young women in
agriculture, and currently now we are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with Food and Agriculture
Organization, and their mandate is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually to bring young women farmers into
farm fairs such as the one which I just
[SPEAKER_00]: showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are going to be getting funding to
start a women's initiative in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: expose young farmers through farm fairs in
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they want women from, let's say,
neighboring Asian countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women young farmers to come in and,
you know, participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also what is called a women's
group in India, and this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest women's group in the world,
and it's called SEWA, and this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Self-Help Employment Group, and I think
the president of that is, I think Sarah is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be bringing her in March to talk
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 2.4 million members in this
group, and they are empowering more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more of their members to get self-employed
through agriculture, through some of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, activities in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, back to your point, you know,
because of time, I sort of restricted it
[SPEAKER_00]: to crop improvement, but yes, that's
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, participation,
I think the IPCCALS has a special
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative on, you know, involving gender
in plant breeding also, so which Harley is
[SPEAKER_00]: leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think, you know, what is important
is when we submit these projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some people, you know,
put the gender indicators without really
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing gender.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's very important that when we want
to implement some of these projects that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really show meaningful indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are really very critical,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah, there are lots of graduate
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, on average,
we have about 65 students who enroll in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fall course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in the fall course, at least about 35
to 40 percent are graduate students,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they come from different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, now in current course,
we have a PhD student from Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have somebody from lots of graduate
students from SIPA, you know, Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from different, and then from A,
well, it's not AEM, but from the Dyson
[SPEAKER_00]: School, Policy and Management from the
Human Ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, from different sections of the
university, we do get graduate students.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, besides, where graduate students are
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we had, you know, the USAID
partnership projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had graduate students involved
where we supported their PhD thesis work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Ronnie, me, and Terry, we are
actually working with, we hope that,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can get this higher education in
agriculture support project, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the World Bank, and that could be
a really big opportunity for Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger opportunity I see is,
you know, if we can create a separate sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of an endowment where graduate students
could be supported on a continuing basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, otherwise, you know, we are doing it
piecemeal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a project, and then the project
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, graduate students are in a
limbo.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
