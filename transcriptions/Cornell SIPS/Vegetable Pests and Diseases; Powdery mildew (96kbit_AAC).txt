[SPEAKER_01]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Kenzie Rodriguez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a PhD student at Cornell and I am
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a vegetable pathologist at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today we will talk about one of the
most common problems that we can see in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbit field and it's powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Chris here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris, can you tell us a little bit
about this problem and what is it and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we can recognize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Kenzie said, powdery mildew is one
of the most common diseases that we see on
[SPEAKER_01]: cucurbits and that's whether it's in a
farmer's field, on a pumpkin field,
[SPEAKER_01]: or zucchini squash field, or in your own
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start to talk a little bit about
powdery mildews in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get their name because they give the
leaf a very powdery look and people will
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize this because you see it on
almost every type of plant there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Importantly, the fungus that attacks
cucurbits is different, similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet different from the one that you might
see on your lilac or your peony or any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other plants that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a powdery mildew that attacks
almost every plant that there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that we can do in order to
control or monitor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about what we're seeing
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at this leaf here,
you see this white powdery appearance and
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost looks like someone has shaken
powdered sugar onto the leaf itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're actually seeing are the spores
of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this fungus has a very unique life
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't grow it in culture in the lab,
which is pretty unusual for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to grow on plant tissue like a leaf
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungal spores like these here,
one spore will land on the leaf and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: actually germinate and penetrate into the
cell of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually essentially sucks the juice
from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing that, what you see on the leaf
here are the spores, but the actual body
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fungus itself is inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked about, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we recognize it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are diagnostic tools, but really
powdery mildew is one of the easiest
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases to identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of control strategies,
powdery mildew is somewhat different from
[SPEAKER_01]: some other plants because it actually
prefers the healthiest leaves on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some diseases do best when the bottom
leaves start to senesce or there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: wound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew really likes that healthy
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because it needs those
healthy cells to get its energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you give the plant too much nitrogen
and you have so many leaves, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: this cucurbit plant has a lot of leaves
here, that actually benefits powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to see these mostly in like
younger or older leaves or it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed even?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are the leaves the only ones that get
the powdery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we see it in the stems of the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it distributed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cucurbits, you'll see it on the
leaves, the petioles of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to pull this one right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see there's powdery mildew on the
petioles of the leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also see it on the stems of,
in particular, you see it on pumpkin
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a huge problem in pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's powdery mildew on the stem,
that handle of the fruit gets weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people go, you know, you're at a
you pick pumpkin farm and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go to pick up your pumpkin and the
handle breaks off and no one wants that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that's due to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to see any eroding over the
fruit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever the disease is present?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the only way you would see rotting,
you know, the powdery isn't really going
[SPEAKER_01]: to attack the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way you'd see rotting is if the
powdery was so severe that the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you lost the leaves and then the fruit
could get sun scald.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once it gets scalded by the sun,
then you can get secondary rots that might
[SPEAKER_01]: come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will pruning the diseased leaves will help
for the disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you prune early enough, I mean,
any time you get inoculum out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: field, you're going to reduce the chance
of spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with powdery mildew, there are so many
spores that it's really, really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: control by taking out the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this plant itself, you know,
probably has a million spores on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: this leaf isn't even that coated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's you can see it,
the powdery mildew just starting right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know that the fungus is
already inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking off the powdery mildew infected
leaves, it isn't going to be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy for controlling this particular
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there if there was one leaf that was
completely coated in powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the plant had a lot less,
I would probably take that off and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a especially in a large field
situation, that that's a tough thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that we can do for
example, are there varieties that are less
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are there are cultivars that
have powdery mildew resistance gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our lab actually is working with a
breeder at Cornell Michael Mazurek.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his lab has different cultivars that
are resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's actually trying to breed that
resistance into winter squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already some resistance in melon
and some of the other cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other thing that you would
like to tell us about the disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So powdery mildew is also somewhat unique
in that it does best when there's high
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, but not free water on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there's water on the leaves,
the knidia of powdery mildew are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: quite fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do well in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's high humidity, they just
thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding ways to keep the humidity down
is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a really rainy year, you tend to see
less powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're in a garden scenario
and it's a dry year, going out and hosing
[SPEAKER_01]: down your plants once a day is actually
just going to increase the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would probably increase the
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things that a girl will do is there
are control strategies, lots of different
[SPEAKER_01]: control strategies for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the fungus produces so many
spores, one of the things that is fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: common, especially in all powdery mildews,
but in cucurbit powdery mildew for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: is fungicide resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers are really careful about
rotating fungicide chemistries and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that they're only using products that
are going to be effective against the
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew that's in their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the home gardener situation,
you might hear a lot of folks talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: baking soda or other things to apply to
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are commercially available
products that are very similar to baking
[SPEAKER_01]: soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can be effective against powdery
mildew, especially on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am a farmer, let's say I have a lot
of cucurbit on my field, does the spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: will affect the absence or presence of the
disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so anything you can do to reduce the
humidity inside of a very lush plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because the canidia can fly a really
long way, its spacing isn't going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as it would with other diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these canidia certainly can fly
throughout this field and to other
[SPEAKER_01]: cucurbit fields in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they have the powdery
mildew, they blow in the wind and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: blow in the wind from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mainly transmitted by the wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any insect that we can see that
can transmit the disease or only wind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wind is the major way that the pathogen
gets around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can overwinter in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see any here today, but sometimes
if you have a very thick patch of powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew like this, you'll see black dots
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are called chasmathesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those chasmathesia are actually the
overwintering structure of the powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those will fall into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this leaf debris is left in the field,
it'll get tilled in and they will release
[SPEAKER_01]: spores in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's frequently how this might get
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you recommend at least getting rid of
like old plant debris in the field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if at all possible, getting rid of
plant debris in the field and just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that's diseased out of your field
will be a big help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just learned about powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need more information or want to
learn more about vegetables, go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell vegetable website and you will
find a lot of information there.
