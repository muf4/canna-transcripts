[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Don mentioned, I was really lucky in
that I got to do part of my degree or
[SPEAKER_00]: award plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in January and things only
started getting interesting when COVID was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did manage to learn a lot from
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to share some of that with
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was my initial plan was my husband
and I were going to travel down to Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully meet some farmers who were
growing organic coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic coffee is one of the biggest
growing areas of coffee in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market share that it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mexican farmers have been doing it
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are probably the most successful
organic coffee growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to go and meet them and see
what I could learn from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, just as we were getting
to the southern part of Mexico in Chiapas,
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID was starting to get interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original plan was that we were going
to travel to Colombia to meet up with some
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growers there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we managed to make some contacts
in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were hoping to get to Peru as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what ended up happening was we drove
all the way down to Tapachula,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is down in the south, very close to
Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on March 12th, we decided,
you know what, it's getting kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican government was starting to shut
down certain institutions and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: museums and universities were starting to
close and we didn't want to get stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to head back to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of days later, we were
spending the night with a friend in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Luis Potosi and we heard that the
Colombian border had shut down and they
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't taking any travelers anymore to
try to keep the virus under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had rented out our Ithaca house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't come back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get to Colombia, which was the
initial plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided, well, let's just spend some
time with my sister in rural Sinaloa,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that sounded like a safer option
than coming back to upstate New York given
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a picture of our car in a
little town called Amburgo in Chiapas,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a couple of kilometers north of
Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, before all of this,
I took advantage of the smart science
[SPEAKER_00]: program, which is hosted in the Dyson
School.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a class that happens over winter
break where, as the name applies,
[SPEAKER_00]: student-led multidisciplinary research
teams come together and basically do a
[SPEAKER_00]: consulting project for an agribusiness in
what they call a developing economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with my former office mate,
Marie Sweatsloot, who is a Cornell grad,
[SPEAKER_00]: we organized a trip down there because we
thought, oh, well, we can bring relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: low-cost, easy soil testing, a little soil
package that we put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do a pH test and we would do an
active carbon test and we would talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers about how their management of
the farms could impact their soil quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we met a lovely organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sorry, that skipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we learned a lot more than we were
able to give back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this experience inspired my drear trip
in that I wanted to fully grasp what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that is limiting coffee farmers nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case people don't know, I'm going to
give a little crash course in what coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the horticultural sense of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of what we know as coffee is a
species called Cofea arabica, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: pictured here next to my very tall
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, it can grow to be a
pretty large bush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows up to around nine meters in the
wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's originally from the highlands of
Ethiopia, where it is an understory shrub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it grows in pretty dense forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like it too warm and it doesn't
like it too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the temperature ideals range between 15
and 24 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely cannot stand any frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes it ideal to grow in the
highlands, in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really tied to precipitation in
terms of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting fact, it's an
allotetraploid, which means that the
[SPEAKER_00]: species arose as a hybridization event
between Cofea canephora, which is another
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee crop that we actually consume,
and Cofea euglinoides, which is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the result, Cofea arabica,
kept two complete copies of both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the only polyploid species in the
genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is self-pollinating, which makes it
relatively easy to propagate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each flower will produce a droop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what we call the coffee cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those usually have two seeds,
which is what we call the coffee beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what most people are familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a very slow crop to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most farmers will start their plants
from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll take them six months between
sowing to actually transplanting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't get a first harvest until two
years after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each year after that,
you'll get an inflorescence, which takes
[SPEAKER_00]: nine months to develop into a fully mature
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is actually a really slowly
developing crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also means that as a farmer,
you need to take care of these seeds for a
[SPEAKER_00]: really long time before you can harvest
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each plant can live around 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more intensive management styles will
place plants around every eight to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, coffee grows in the
tropics because of the ideal temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brazil is the only country that can
afford to grow it on flat land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have these huge extensions of
perfect altitude, perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has allowed them to have enormous
plantations that are completely mechanized
[SPEAKER_00]: and completely everything is done in a
really technological way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see monocultures, all the same
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's handled in a very intensive
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see in the image to the
left, that also leads to harvesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are harvesting green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're harvesting red beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ripeness of those beans is going
to be completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Colombian coffee became so
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the topography that the rest of
Latin America has, which is these really
[SPEAKER_00]: rough mountains, allows for the right
elevation for coffee to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't allow for mechanization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't have mechanical picking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the Latin American countries did
is they capitalized on what would have
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise been a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of having these very efficient
plantations as they do in Brazil,
[SPEAKER_00]: what these countries did was promote the
quality of their coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, as I mentioned, everything has to
be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So labor is incredibly important in coffee
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are actual pictures of last
year's harvest in Colombia from this great
[SPEAKER_00]: article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to point out that the
ripeness of the cherries is very even.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see in the basket in the top
left is that all the beans are red and
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually some farms where the
pickers will paint their thumbnails red so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can match up the thumbnails to
the cherries that they're picking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the organization that we worked
with through the SMART programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name is Federacion Campesina del
Cauca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are a second tier organization
that makes up around 700 member families.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all small holders, which means
that they have relatively small farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average farm size in this organization
is around maybe three acres or 1.5
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They promote organic coffee as part of
their mission to improve the livelihood of
[SPEAKER_00]: local farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just a wonderful group in that
they have really tried to do all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to work on the growing part of
it, on the quality part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've even started roasting their own
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the biggest lesson that I got
from them is that coffee growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to manage their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know how to make the right
decisions for their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that they do not have access
to is the market side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do have a lot of other challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And climate change is just exacerbating
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is incredible to see how aware
these farmers are of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a single farmer I've ever
talked to who doesn't mention climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change as the biggest challenge they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the consequences of this is
that the coffee berry borer, which is this
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little beetle, it likes hot
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it benefits from hotter years in that
it manages to produce more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it accelerates its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have more generations happening
within a particular time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of my hand holding a
bean that was infested with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their life cycle is very interesting in
that they very infrequently mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of their reproduction happens through
parthenogenesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the females will leave the infected
bean only for a very short period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: and will find an uninfected bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they bore their way into it,
lay eggs, and then die inside the bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The picture on the right here is a trap
where you have soapy water in the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of this bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the little vial, you have a
mixture of ethanol and methanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which attracts them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just fall in there and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they use these traps to keep track of
the population sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to manage this bug really
is cultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pick every single bean that
is in the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let any beans fall to the ground,
they will just become breeding grounds for
[SPEAKER_00]: new bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they spend such a short amount of
time outside of the bean, spraying for
[SPEAKER_00]: them is not really an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless your neighbors and everyone in
your region is working together to control
[SPEAKER_00]: this bug, it can really become a problem
if people leave ripe beans just lying
[SPEAKER_00]: around for them to infest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another huge issue that coffee growers
have is coffee leaf rust, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an obligate, oh my god, I forgot the
word.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need a living tissue to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will infect the underside of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they create these little spots that
look like rust, hence the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can propagate ridiculously long
distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to understand what is
exactly going to cause an outbreak of
[SPEAKER_00]: rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two particular cases that stand
out in the history of coffee rust in Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, it devastated Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2011 to 2012, it devastated
Central America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think that the patterns match up
with greater meteorological patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they think that El Nino fluctuations
might be involved in spreading the spores
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the whole region.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of influence on the
changes between daylight and nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures and relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, climate change is just
exacerbating the disease pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what conventional coffee
plantations will have is susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see on the right,
what ends up happening is when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: really bad infestation, your plants lose
all their leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily die from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your crop is definitely affected for
the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with the FCC, I learned,
though, that the biggest problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee growers have is the fluctuations in
the coffee price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the coffee in the world is
still being sold through the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's terribly unfortunate because
the stock exchange doesn't really care
[SPEAKER_00]: about the weather or how good the
production was in one place versus
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of all the financial tools that
people use, trading in futures and all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of speculation, the price that
coffee growers get for their crop is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard for them to plan for
the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graph is showing the prices in
dollars per pound that people are trading
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee at the stock exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the farmers get a fraction of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on who they sell their
coffee to, that fraction can be anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from 60% of this price to 90% is the
highest that I ever heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, the price increased a
little bit during 2012 after the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf rust devastated central Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it just keeps getting
lower and lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organizations such as Fair Trade have
come together and said, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to guarantee these farmers at
least a minimum price that will cover
[SPEAKER_00]: their production costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they agreed on $1.40 as the Fair Trade
minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that only applies to farmers that
can afford to sell their coffee to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who recognizes that they are
following the Fair Trade guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certifications come at their own cost
to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sell organic Fair Trade certified
coffee, then you have a price of $1.70,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also need to have access to
somebody who will buy your coffee as such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, it comes down to financial
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a coffee farmer is not making ends meet
at the end of the year, they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: viable for a couple of more years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't keep it up in the long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Miguel Gomez at the Dyson School and
his team have been working on what does it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually cost to produce coffee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because data are just ridiculously hard to
come up with in the first place,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also compare between different systems
in different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they teamed up with Fair Trade and the
Atkinson Center and did this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: project where they tracked how much does
it cost to produce a pound of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they teamed up with these four
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was in Mexico, in Honduras,
in Colombia, which happens to be the FCC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organization I worked with,
and then one in Peru.
[SPEAKER_00]: And between them, they gathered 2,400
members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their average farm size was 3.5 hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's somewhere around eight acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: This represents a total volume of more
than 16 million pounds, which is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is certified Fair Trade,
and most of it is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these farmers actually have access to
what we would consider the higher end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the coffee price.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what this study found was that
none of these farmers are making enough
[SPEAKER_00]: money to make their farms viable in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph shows the costs of coffee
production separated from in different
[SPEAKER_00]: categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the variable costs are the things that
you don't necessarily have to do every
[SPEAKER_00]: time, things like you might fertilize this
year, but not next year, or you may have
[SPEAKER_00]: to invest more in pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fixed costs are the things that happen
every year, things like taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor for the harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depreciation cost includes the cost
of, OK, so you buy a tractor this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it wears and tears over a year,
so it loses value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the total costs account for how
much it costs to establish the coffee farm
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place, how much it costs to
buy new seeds, things like that that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily happen all the time,
but that ultimately make part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the little red dot in the middle
is the farm gate price that these coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though most of these people are
selling their coffee as fair trade
[SPEAKER_00]: certified, which would guarantee them that
$1.40 minimum, they are not getting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are getting a ridiculously lower
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this experience that I've had
with coffee is meeting all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: smallholder farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around the world, we're talking about
25 million people who farm less than 10
[SPEAKER_00]: hectares and usually fall below the
poverty line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many of them have this incredibly
strong attachment to their land and their
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been farming coffee for
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many can trace their coffee ancestry back
to like the 1800s, at least the people
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So losing their coffee business is more
than just losing their cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tied to their identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they are farmers, they're also
growing their own crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing their own food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you don't necessarily put a
value on the additional crops that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you're still feeding your family off
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the value that is, in a way,
not monetized is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's at risk of being lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used part of the time on the Dreyer
to participate in this workshop that was
[SPEAKER_00]: organized by the University of Wapnehan in
collaboration with SEAT, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Center for International Tropical
Agriculture based in Cali, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, many of you might
recognize Alyssa Pritz and Marie
[SPEAKER_00]: Swetslund, who are Cornelians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought together these coffee
researchers from around the world with
[SPEAKER_00]: different expertise on pests and on
marketing and on agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted to diagnose what is going
on with coffee growing and what is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen to all of these people and all
of these landscapes that are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we identified six main trends and
research needs for the next decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that we're seeing is
that people are substituting their
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional varieties because,
like I said, traditional varieties are
[SPEAKER_00]: very susceptible to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can have a resistant variety,
you are going to simplify your production
[SPEAKER_00]: costs, but also it's going to make your
whole farm a little bit more resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a big push towards
intensification because if you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce your costs, you have to increase
your yields to keep financially
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of land abandonment and
land use substitution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've probably all heard about the
South American, the Central American
[SPEAKER_00]: migrations that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are afraid and there's a lot of
violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very, very few economic
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are leaving their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of Columbia, there's huge
pressure from illegal crops on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: lands that coffee now occupies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's also been a lot of
expansion of range into higher elevations
[SPEAKER_00]: because of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as temperatures get higher,
people are pushing higher, higher up the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains, threatening native forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also a couple of countries that
had traditionally banned the growing of
[SPEAKER_00]: Caffea Canephora, known as Robusta,
because it's traditionally known as lower
[SPEAKER_00]: quality coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are now starting to allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a lot of urbanization as
some of these communities get more
[SPEAKER_00]: wealthy, people start leaving the
countryside for the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decide to build houses on their
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of this land is being lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This problem is particularly bad in Costa
Rica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to focus on these three trends
just because I saw them during my trip and
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think they're the more general
ones to the whole of Latin America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge problem with traditional
coffee varieties and that they are a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's absolutely no disease
resistance genes in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of what we know as at least
Arabica coffee comes from the few plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Europeans back in the probably
1600s took from Yemen and started bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: to their colonies, in particular to
Indonesia and to what was Ceylon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in itself is already a
bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the plants that got to Latin
America are just a substitute of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the varieties that are now grown
throughout all of Latin America come
[SPEAKER_00]: basically from the Tipica and the Bourbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though there are a handful of
other and people usually will associate
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity and the bean sizes and
colors, which you can see in the left-hand
[SPEAKER_00]: side with genetic diversity, the truth is
that these varieties are very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a huge push for promoting
these varieties called Katimors and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sarchimors because they come from a wild
hybrid that was found years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: decades ago in Indonesia in an island
called Timor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a hybrid between Kofia Arabica
and Kofia Canephora.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hybrid actually has disease
resistance genes against coffee leaf rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have been intergressing those
genes back into the more culturally
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable coffee varieties, but there's
been a lot of pushback because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with lower quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned before, there was a
big leaf rust outbreak in Colombia in 2008
[SPEAKER_00]: where 80% of the coffee was susceptible to
rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, the Federation of Coffee
Growers in Colombia has been pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to get people to plant
resistant varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point where in 2018, 80% of the
coffee in Colombia was resistant to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least that problem's been kind of
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in speaking with the farmers,
I've learned that they don't particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: like growing these resistant varieties
because they have other characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're harder to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beans feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sizes are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this myth that the quality is
inferior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to take a second to talk about
the National Coffee Grower Federation in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, it started as the union of
coffee growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mention them because they
are the only example I know of where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a strong institution that is
taking care of coffee growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can probably recognize the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an incredible marketing campaign
back in the 80s where something like 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: of people in Europe will recognize the
logo as a high quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the image in the left is an actual
actor who's, this is his real time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is Juan Valdez.
[SPEAKER_00]: He impersonates this Colombian coffee
grower and he carries his meal around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is at the red carpet party that
they held for a movie a while ago called
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Almighty, where he actually requests
coffee grown in the mountains of Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: from Juan Valdez.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason I bring it up is because
it's probably the most successful
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing campaign for an agricultural
product that doesn't yet have any added
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Colombian coffee is green beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even roasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet everyone everywhere recognizes it
as a high quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I learned recently that in 2005,
it was the first non-European product to
[SPEAKER_00]: be granted a protected denomination of
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's essentially champagne and
Parmesan cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Colombian coffee,
which is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been another trend in how
coffee is grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that coffee was grown in the
understory of a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the coffee plants come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can have what is known as
rustic coffee, where you just have an
[SPEAKER_00]: intact forest that you just grow a couple
of coffee plants on the bottom of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been a strong push towards
intensification, which is on the lower end
[SPEAKER_00]: of this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you basically have no
shade or just a few shade trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes in part because if you're
in the mountains, usually you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants are going to be light
limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to increase your yields,
the best thing you can do is increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: light access of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the more shade you have,
the more ecosystem services that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, there's good data that if
you have more birds, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: less coffee bean borer pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more shade, it's going to
reduce the fluctuations in temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the leaf rust is going to hit your
coffee less hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also have additional benefits of
nitrogen fixation, depending on the trees
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use, of different soil quality,
different nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a really strong push,
especially from academic circles,
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to grow coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee under some sort of agroforest
polyculture system.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the shift towards growing Robusta
coffee is doing the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pushing for monocultures,
because Robusta is a really hardy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely resistant to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take harsh conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take high temperatures and
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it yields something like twice as much
as an arabica crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has higher caffeine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's preferred for processed coffee
beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your pre-made Starbucks coffee and your
Four Loco and your five-hour energy drink,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of those caffeine products probably
come from Robusta.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were in Mexico in the southern
part of Chiapas, we met up with this
[SPEAKER_00]: lovely professor at Ecosur, which is their
regional university.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Juan Barrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he works on biological control of
coffee bean borer in Robusta plantations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that he showed us
was the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from these beautiful forests to
a completely exposed field with these
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous Robusta plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, it's the bigger producers that
are shifting to Robusta, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in yield is just really
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also told us that the only buyer in
the region is Nestle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that presents a problem for the
farmers, because they don't trust Nestle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also been a lot of resistance
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Nestle did was they introduced
four clones of Robusta that they figured
[SPEAKER_00]: were optimized for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this makes the farmers really
skeptical, because they know that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a lower quality product,
which they're not going to be able to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: if Nestle one day decides to leave or just
to not buy their coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did meet this lovely man called Fidel
Lopez, also in the southern region of
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiapas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a completely different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used to grow conventional coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the coffee leaf rust hit his farm
in 2012, he decided he just couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford the pesticides, so he was going to
let it go and basically abandon his farm
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he came back and he saw his
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way he tells the story is he found
these trees that just looked more
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he harvested their seeds and
propagated them and started his coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: plantation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also decided that he was going to
grow organic coffee, because it was safer
[SPEAKER_00]: for his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, most of these small
holders have farms that are maybe four
[SPEAKER_00]: acres, and their houses are on them and
their children are playing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody wants to be spraying pesticides
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of these small holder
farmers, the organic certification has the
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal that they feel like they're safer
and that they're taking care of their
[SPEAKER_00]: little plot of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: He decided also that he was going to start
roasting his own coffee and selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he teamed up with his family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the whole family runs this little
company called Cafe Urquidea, where they
[SPEAKER_00]: sell the product that they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that it's working out really
well for him because he's actually making
[SPEAKER_00]: more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is him showing us one of those
wonderful trees that he claims has become
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had at least three different varieties
of coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had one that was produced by the
Mexican equivalent to the USDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was an improved variety resistant to
rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the others he had were the traditional
susceptible varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he claims he has absolutely no rust
pressure in his soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that it's working out really
well for his farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the latest things that is
affecting coffee growers is unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what the Colombian Federation
of Farmers is doing to try to keep people
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken their traditional logo and
transformed it into on the left to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: social distance and on the right to cover
your mouth when you sneeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying that Colombia expects to have
the best harvest ever in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, because the coffee harvest
is so labor intensive, they require a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of migrant workers to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually move throughout the
whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned before, coffee blooms
right after the rainy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the way the winds work in
Colombia, there's very discreet rainy
[SPEAKER_00]: season that starts at the beginning of the
year in the north and then moves south
[SPEAKER_00]: along the Andes and then ends at the
southern part of the Andes in Colombia at
[SPEAKER_00]: around October and then will basically
shift the rain back north.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the middle of the country has two
harvests while the north and the south
[SPEAKER_00]: part have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this huge body of migrant
workers that just move with the rains
[SPEAKER_00]: following the coffee harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously COVID is a horrible risk
because not only are you putting these
[SPEAKER_00]: people in risk, they're just literally
moving it across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big problem is that because people
are leaving the countryside for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cities, it's hard to find laborers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the surprising
situations in which the very sad situation
[SPEAKER_00]: in Venezuela has proved useful for
Colombian coffee growers in that
[SPEAKER_00]: Venezuelans now make up a big chunk of the
migrant laborers that pick coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's all I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the introduction, the
interruption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what happened.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where our host is,
but I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, are there other questions for
Juana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Juana, this is Marvin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like with that narrow genetic
diversity, the industry is crying out for
[SPEAKER_02]: a breeding program for expanding the
diversity of the germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happening around the world with
breeding programs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, there's a lot of
people who are interested in the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee species in the forests of Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently there's huge pressure on
these forests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of concern that the
source of all this genetic diversity is
[SPEAKER_00]: being lost because of deforestation and
expansion of the agricultural boundaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a research group from Texas that
is working on producing F1 hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that coffee growers,
at least to my knowledge, do not work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because production costs are so high,
what most growers will do is they will
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate their own plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you grab your seeds from the good
plants, and then you start your new
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with an F1 hybrid,
you need to buy the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to mean more costs for
the coffee growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that they're promoting this in
Mexico and in Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard of an F1 hybrid program in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FNC, which is the Colombian coffee
union, they have a research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just released a new variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release varieties, I think,
every five years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are very, very specialized
regionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will release their latest variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Cenicafe 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have a Cenicafe for the center,
Cenicafe for north, Cenicafe for south.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very specialized in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will use rootstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've only seen this in big
plantations, 300 hectares or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they'll use the Robusta rootstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rootstock on Arabica scions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to work really well,
at least for disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they've developed a transgenic
coffee resistant to the coffee bean borer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one wants to release that,
because that immediately means you lose
[SPEAKER_00]: their European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a dead end, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all I know of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions for Juana?
Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the place that we don't generally
get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always enjoyed your blogs from
Colombia and wherever you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some questions on the
chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know why fair trade guarantees 140
when growers get less than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coffee is really complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers are really far away,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to bring their coffee to a
gathering, a warehouse where everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: brings their coffee to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people, they need to bring their
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the values that I presented here are
what's called value at farm gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to include transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the further you are, the more that is
going to cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, I can speak for Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roads are terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the distance might not be
too long, but the road is so bad that it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes you hours to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big chunk that gets taken off
the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, most smallholders will be
part of an organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that organization takes its share too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the organization sells the
coffee for 140, they don't pay the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: 140 because they have their own operating
costs and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of these four organizations
that were considered in this study,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the year, they'll all get
together and they'll decide, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are we spending this extra money that
we got from fair trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: As their premium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some will say, all right, we want
dividends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some will say we want some sort of
improvement project that benefits the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe they'll build a school or they'll
build a processing plant or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some people will fund extension
agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will fund even scholarships
for their members.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends a lot on what the
organization wants and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know of Illy, which is a big coffee
seller in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also guarantee that they buy their
coffee at 140.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this value was, they came up
with it kind of out of nowhere because the
[SPEAKER_00]: costs of production are really hard to
estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the smart programs that I did was
trying to come up with what is this cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found is it's really hard
because a lot of rural economy is still
[SPEAKER_00]: very informal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are no receipts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no keeping track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers don't like to keep track because
they don't want to know how much money
[SPEAKER_00]: they're losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a tricky situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're such a big organization as
Fair Trade, which is in every country and
[SPEAKER_00]: in almost all crops, it's hard to come up
with a baseline cost that's going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that answered the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of any progress in the USDA
coffee germplasm collection to develop a
[SPEAKER_01]: release coffee germplasm with rust
resistance and superior cupping quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea about the USDA coffee
collection, I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear that they found rust in Hawaii,
which is really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all I know, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering, this last picture here
kind of looks like a very diversified
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering what you think the
future holds for doing more regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: types of agriculture where more of the
ground is actually covered with crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: or if the future really holds us cutting
more and more of our rainforest down,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what the irrigation schemes look like,
especially as water becomes more scarce as
[SPEAKER_03]: the water cycle is disrupted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that successful
coffee farmers are doing is diversifying
[SPEAKER_00]: and not necessarily separating their
crops, but incorporating everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, there's
pineapples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the foreground, there's banana
trees and the coffee in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a strategy that's proven very
successful, more than for, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem services, for food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of smallholder coffee
farmers are very food insecure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of organizations are promoting
diversification as a strategy to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: food security.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes with benefits of better
soil quality and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of more broader scale things,
there's a couple of good examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: payments for ecosystem services to coffee
farmers in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they tend to miss the smallholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be the bigger farms that can
afford to dedicate half the farm to forest
[SPEAKER_00]: and then get paid for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have a couple of acres,
you can't afford to not farm at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then you just don't make enough
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a research perspective,
there is a big push for agroforestry
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, in that you have a forest,
it serves a function, and you can select
[SPEAKER_00]: species that are valuable for wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you have a bad coffee
year, you can cut down your trees and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and you're not going to starve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard, because until we start
valuing the ecosystem services,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as carbon sequestration, on a global
level, no one's going to pay the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the farmer doesn't get paid,
then ultimately, they're not successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that answered the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really great presentation,
Juana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where Don went, but I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank you for all your
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you're still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk to you in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to the chair committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
