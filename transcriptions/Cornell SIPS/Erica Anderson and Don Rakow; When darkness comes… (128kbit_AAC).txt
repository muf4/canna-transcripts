[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so much for coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really a pleasure to be back here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm presenting on a topic that's
really special to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll start off with just an
introduction to why this topic is
[SPEAKER_05]: important, and then some of the research
that I did for my thesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Don will give you an overview of
what's happening here at Cornell with an
[SPEAKER_05]: exciting new initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, the topic of how nature affects
well-being started more in the arts than
[SPEAKER_05]: it did in the sciences.
[SPEAKER_05]: I studied art history for a while,
and I've always loved this painting by Van
[SPEAKER_05]: Gogh.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wrote in a letter to his brother
how much looking at nature was a comfort
[SPEAKER_05]: to him in his final years when he was
confined to an asylum.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he continued to paint, and it was
really the connection for his sanity.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what he was painting was nature,
and this beautiful picture came out in one
[SPEAKER_05]: of the last years of his life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Secret Garden was one of my favorite
books, and I really delved into it a few
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the theme of how working in a
garden restores well-being is very
[SPEAKER_05]: powerful in that story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a picture of the 80 White House
gardens, and that among all the other
[SPEAKER_05]: gardens and Cornell plantations.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just so much beauty on this
campus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not only as a grad student,
but as an undergrad, I found so much
[SPEAKER_05]: solace finding these places and little
places to hide away and get away from the
[SPEAKER_05]: pressures of academic life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so there's really three core issues
at the heart of my research.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, the statistics for mental health
among college-age students are very
[SPEAKER_05]: shocking.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 57% who feel overwhelming
anxiety, and also 35% who have felt so
[SPEAKER_05]: depressed that it was difficult to
function.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that statistic very troubling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of these numbers are really high,
and here are some numbers for what causes
[SPEAKER_05]: the most stress, academics being the top,
but a whole bunch of other issues as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely a problem among
students.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one in three really has faces of some
kind of mental health issue in addition to
[SPEAKER_05]: all the overwhelming stress of being a
student.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is another number that is really
amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other issue for me was public gardens
at colleges and universities.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a specific kind of public garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: They work with the university by having a
mission that coincides with that of the
[SPEAKER_05]: university.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are often fighting for their
existence, trying to show that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: relevant to the university.
[SPEAKER_05]: And often that leads to some issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an article that it was discussed
that why should these resources be going
[SPEAKER_05]: to this organization within the university
that maybe is not always clearly academic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the issue of relevance is a key part of
the equation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally, the literature on these
subjects.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's certainly a broad amount of
literature on nature and well-being,
[SPEAKER_05]: and also within each of the areas of
health and with mental health and in
[SPEAKER_05]: colleges and universities.
[SPEAKER_05]: But where they intersect, it's not as
much, and it's certainly not as much when
[SPEAKER_05]: you get into the study of public gardens,
particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many of these gardens at
colleges and universities, and yet they're
[SPEAKER_05]: not really being thought of in terms of
how are they helping students beyond the
[SPEAKER_05]: academic part of their life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just arguing the public gardens,
they very well could hold the keys to
[SPEAKER_05]: rejuvenation of student well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: On these campuses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I wanted to try to answer was
whether psychological well-being,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's a priority at college and
university gardens, and whether they can
[SPEAKER_05]: do a better job at appropriating that
role.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before I get into the more research
part, I had to really dig into literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to give an overview of the
way I thought of this was kind of going
[SPEAKER_05]: from a broad amount of literature down to
a point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with the breadth of
literature on nature and well-being,
[SPEAKER_05]: but then going down and getting closer to
the college and university experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are some of the key thinkers that
I wanted to introduce to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ulrich, who wrote an essay on the power of
a view through hospital windows,
[SPEAKER_05]: that patients actually had a better chance
of recovery and reaction to pain
[SPEAKER_05]: medications, and also fewer negative
comments from nurses for when they
[SPEAKER_05]: actually had a view of nature as opposed
to a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another set of authors, the Caplins,
wrote about particularly this concept of
[SPEAKER_05]: restorative environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's based on this notion that there
is directed attention, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: voluntary type of attention, and it
requires effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when that becomes fatigued,
that is the core of the problem is
[SPEAKER_05]: directed attention fatigue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And environments, natural environments
particularly, have been known to soothe
[SPEAKER_05]: this, actually restore directed attention
fatigue for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: But particularly because often they create
a feeling of being away, being set apart.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a feeling of an extent of space.
[SPEAKER_05]: They create fascination.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all these features contribute to an
environment being restorative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these authors, actually right here at
Cornell, did a really neat essay about
[SPEAKER_05]: school children and how access to nature
really worked as a buffer for stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So their concept of nearby nature,
the value of having it close by,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was a function of how well these
students responded and how it reduced
[SPEAKER_05]: their amount of stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: Richard Louvre, his classic concept of
nature deficit disorder, kind of close to
[SPEAKER_05]: attention deficit disorder or other mental
disorders, but he puts this in the mix and
[SPEAKER_05]: says that there is a lack of interaction
with nature among children and he
[SPEAKER_05]: recommends vitamin N for vitamin nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the question of the dose of
nature, how much is enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a study that was done that said
that even a minimal amount of exposure to
[SPEAKER_05]: nature and activity in nature,
just five minutes was considered the most
[SPEAKER_05]: effective of any of the other amounts that
were experimented with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a small amount of time, also low
intensity was found to be effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the difference in environments
between urban and more natural,
[SPEAKER_05]: it didn't seem to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were all helpful as long as they had
some kind of green element.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so now going just from that broad
amount of literature, those are just
[SPEAKER_05]: samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: With mental health literature,
common themes are that disorders appear in
[SPEAKER_05]: the first three decades of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because these are the ages that our
college students, there's a high
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage on these campuses of students
who suffer with these illnesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's so many other factors
that affect mental wellbeing as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of them are certainly represented
on diverse campuses.
[SPEAKER_05]: One that I found interesting was the issue
of help seeking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Help seeking is something that students
are notorious for not reaching out for
[SPEAKER_05]: help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And often treatment is delayed because of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a challenge that needs to be
considered.
[SPEAKER_05]: In looking for a way into how I was going
to approach public gardens with this
[SPEAKER_05]: topic, I looked for other studies that
were done on campuses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were a few.
[SPEAKER_05]: University of Massachusetts Amherst,
they tried a horticultural therapy
[SPEAKER_05]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Students went in and interacted with
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did different techniques with a
horticultural therapist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then took a survey and found that
there are some glitches in the study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But predominantly it was showing how
stress was significantly relieved by this
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this university in Hong Kong,
views of green spaces and also just the
[SPEAKER_05]: use patterns of different green spaces
were analyzed and recommendations were
[SPEAKER_05]: made based on those results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this university in England also was
interesting because it looked at different
[SPEAKER_05]: spaces on campus and found that certain
spaces closer to buildings, usually more
[SPEAKER_05]: formal environments, were really much more
preferred than further away, sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: more wild or natural environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that though many students knew
about these spaces, only about 50% really
[SPEAKER_05]: used them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then getting into gardens as sort of a
subset of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is special about the garden
particularly?
[SPEAKER_05]: And often gardens are described as a
series of rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a feeling of escape or getting
away that they promote.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an article done for the Public
Garden Magazine that talked about how
[SPEAKER_05]: gardens are this refuge from our difficult
time that we live in with so much
[SPEAKER_05]: information and technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And access to problems worldwide and that
the garden is a safe place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was after 9-11.
[SPEAKER_05]: This statement was made saying that at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, there had never
[SPEAKER_05]: been such an overflow of people who just
needed that garden right after that
[SPEAKER_05]: devastating day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how they opened their doors to people
and people really needed that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in discussing gardens,
there's also some literature about why we
[SPEAKER_05]: prefer gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for some, it goes back to an
evolutionary perspective of that we were
[SPEAKER_05]: designed to or programmed to really want
to be in an environment that feels safe,
[SPEAKER_05]: usually an open one with trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it takes away from the stress of that
fight or flight response.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other view is especially over most of
history was just the creation view of the
[SPEAKER_05]: story, the history of the Garden of Eden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just that we were made for gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were made to be gardeners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a man named Benjamin Rush who was one
of our founding fathers and a physician
[SPEAKER_05]: and psychologist but really a
psychiatrist, he wrote about gardening as
[SPEAKER_05]: an effective means for treating mentally
ill in his day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And horticultural therapy actually owes
its creation to Benjamin Rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: University gardens have a history of their
own.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really developed in about the 13th
century in England.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oxford and Cambridge were the result of
monasteries that dissolved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had cloistered gardens,
these spaces that were very private and
[SPEAKER_05]: meant to be places of healing and escape
for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these became places of institutions of
learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then later on in Europe and especially
Italy in the 16th century, gardens at
[SPEAKER_05]: universities started to become more
incorporated into the intellectual life of
[SPEAKER_05]: the university.
[SPEAKER_05]: They became great collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were studied for their plants,
for their medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the concept of the garden as a
living classroom really started to develop
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think is what is predominant today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our lovely Cornell
Plantations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just had to get that in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: My study had two parts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a series of interviews with nine
public gardens at colleges and
[SPEAKER_05]: universities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to ask a variety of
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the institutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Arnold at Harvard, Smith College,
Cornell of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Garvin is a beautiful garden that's 175
miles apart from its campus in Arkansas
[SPEAKER_05]: and just gave another, an interesting
insight into its challenges that it has in
[SPEAKER_05]: reaching students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ralston in North Carolina, Mathai at
University of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Morris Arboretum, University of
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scott Arboretum at Swarthmore and UC
Davis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a broad, different kinds of
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it gave me a lot of different
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Key to what I was looking for from these
gardens was the mission that, not only the
[SPEAKER_05]: mission of the garden but of the
university and how they complemented each
[SPEAKER_05]: other.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this quotation is one that is often
that was posed to public gardens as saying
[SPEAKER_05]: to stay relevant, be sure that your
mission is in the vein of the mission of
[SPEAKER_05]: your overarching organization,
the university.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this was another thought that
came out of these interviews was the
[SPEAKER_05]: concern about being not academic enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some, at least one garden voiced this
concern that it wasn't, it was afraid of
[SPEAKER_05]: not, of embracing other types of
initiatives because it might not appear
[SPEAKER_05]: academic enough, that it was just seen as
a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is an interesting way of looking at
it, that it's somehow bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something I wanted to think
about more throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: My questions were very basic questions
about just access to the garden and how
[SPEAKER_05]: they market themselves, but also more
questions related to well-being,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it's stated in mission statements,
what types of spaces they offer,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they have any involvement with health
services, those kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a large area of what I was looking
at were statements of mission and vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just put up Cornell, for instance,
just a couple snippets that show how there
[SPEAKER_05]: are very much related, Cornell with
enhancing lives and livelihoods of
[SPEAKER_05]: students and Cornell Plantations with
enhancing collections for the enrichment
[SPEAKER_05]: of students.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's definitely an interplay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked at the text of these
statements for all these gardens and their
[SPEAKER_05]: universities and looked for how they might
introduce the topic of well-being or
[SPEAKER_05]: reaching students.
[SPEAKER_05]: My observations from the mission
statements part of the research was few
[SPEAKER_05]: had really direct references, but there
were a couple that actually talked about
[SPEAKER_05]: how gardens and how the university is
reaching out to benefit student lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And particularly actually making reference
to well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those were few.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I believe there was more of a
perception that they were helping students
[SPEAKER_05]: in this way, but not so much actually
making this an explicit mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: I identified different types of references
that were indirect, things that referenced
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainability or other aspects that
gestured towards well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were many of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw them as opportunities for the
garden to embrace as ways of getting into
[SPEAKER_05]: the topic of well-being and promoting
well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I asked the gardens for spaces that
they considered restorative and that
[SPEAKER_05]: promoted this feeling of getting away that
I found in the literature, usually highly
[SPEAKER_05]: designed areas were mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Natural areas too.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple times Asian theme gardens were
referenced as being considered
[SPEAKER_05]: restorative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes those that were at a
distance from the campus or that contained
[SPEAKER_05]: a structure within it were referenced as
being considered restorative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are some images from some of
these gardens, including plantations,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also spaces that have been considered
by the people that I spoke with as being
[SPEAKER_05]: restorative.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of programming, five of the
gardens had programs that were about
[SPEAKER_05]: addressing well-being.
[SPEAKER_05]: Often or most all of them were an exercise
program or more of physical health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of those gardens had programs
specifically for student well-being and
[SPEAKER_05]: plantations being one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think there's definitely
something going on just hasn't actually
[SPEAKER_05]: filtered down to students specifically
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some developments that are
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: The escape program at Morris Arboretum is
an exciting one to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the issue of being about 10
miles away from downtown Philadelphia,
[SPEAKER_05]: the campus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So enticing students to get away and to
get away from the busy downtown
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Morris Arboretum has really taken
advantage of different types of media to
[SPEAKER_05]: market to students through the notion of
escape.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been very successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And offering transportation particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this has been a successful example of
trying to get students out in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with working together with health
services, only a few have had active
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, plantations is in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And two of these gardens have had that
relationship started.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of student suicides,
that was just an interesting one to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: aware of that often these calamities
actually promote these conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And would it be the other way around?
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really wonderful that they
would be approached before these types of
[SPEAKER_05]: events happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to get a narrower picture besides
what was happening in public gardens and
[SPEAKER_05]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a ready sample here at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to just get some student
perspectives as opposed to administrators
[SPEAKER_05]: of public gardens is what I was speaking
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did a few surveys of a variety of
students.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to compare two types of students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ones that are focused more on nature,
such as in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then students who are notoriously not
focused on nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Engineering students who actually have a
reputation at Cornell as being the most
[SPEAKER_05]: stressed of all students.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my survey was just a simple paper
survey with asking a variety of questions
[SPEAKER_05]: about their level of stress for one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was interesting was the
horticulture students and engineers,
[SPEAKER_05]: although I had some different numbers of
how many students I interviewed,
[SPEAKER_05]: the same percentages had a high level of
frequent stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was basically proportional on the
kinds of stress that they were reporting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So most of them had several times a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another large chunk was those who
said all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And taken together, those are about 74%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was equal to the engineers as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was interesting for me to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I asked about coping strategies,
eating more, sleeping more.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as activities involving nature,
going outside, spending time in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: These activities tended to be more likely
done by horticulture students as opposed
[SPEAKER_05]: to the engineers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why horticulture students
were two times more likely to consume or
[SPEAKER_05]: drink drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little troubling.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was also interesting that they were
more likely to spend time in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The notion of whether nature
prescriptions, I asked students whether
[SPEAKER_05]: they thought nature prescriptions,
such as being prescribed to take a walk in
[SPEAKER_05]: nature, whether that would be an effective
treatment for stress and for other
[SPEAKER_05]: illnesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those who said that it would be very
effective tended to rate the benefits of
[SPEAKER_05]: nature to well-being and also the value
that they placed on green things on
[SPEAKER_05]: campus.
[SPEAKER_05]: They rated those areas the highest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those who rated the connection between
nature and well-being lower and also who
[SPEAKER_05]: valued nature less actually did not like
the idea of nature prescriptions as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a connection there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked about what prevents you from
spending more time outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Engineers were more likely in certain
areas not to know where places were.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't what their friends were doing
and just a preference for being indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what I wanted to get across here
was that those who reported that nature
[SPEAKER_05]: was beneficial to well-being and that
campus green was important to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: when they rated it the highest,
that coincided with the number of times
[SPEAKER_05]: that they visited a public garden or
Cornell Plantations in this case.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones who go to plantations every day,
they also valued nature the most.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the ones who never or only once a
year would go into any of the areas of
[SPEAKER_05]: plantations, they rated the value of
nature to well-being very low or also the
[SPEAKER_05]: value of green in plants was rated lower
the fewer times that they would spend at
[SPEAKER_05]: plantations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to find out what might entice
students to come to plantations more and
[SPEAKER_05]: top being more transportation being
offered, events and activities,
[SPEAKER_05]: things like Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some you just can't get to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end I just had recommendations.
[SPEAKER_05]: One being that identifying, making a case
for well-being and often getting it down
[SPEAKER_05]: in writing is very helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having it in a mission and if it's not try
to see if you can get it in there because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's something everybody can work from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to make a link between academic
performance and well-being might help this
[SPEAKER_05]: cause be promoted more because there is
that concern of being relevant and often
[SPEAKER_05]: for universities the academic achievement
is the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: So showing the connection between how
well-being often and how nature
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences can really boost your
concentration and your ability to perform
[SPEAKER_05]: that might be a way for gardens to say
look at us and this is an important thing
[SPEAKER_05]: we can do for the university.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only just being a garden but coming at
it with others such as health services Don
[SPEAKER_05]: will be telling you about an initiative
here at Cornell that is doing this very
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the garden and seeing what
types of spaces it has that could be
[SPEAKER_05]: considered restorative and really
marketing those to students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting ideas from other gardens like the
escape program at Morris or just taking a
[SPEAKER_05]: step there's a grassroots organization
called Active Minds that was started at
[SPEAKER_05]: UPenn in the wake of a student suicide and
this group has just grown and they do
[SPEAKER_05]: awareness events at universities and it
would be interesting to have maybe host
[SPEAKER_05]: one of those events at a public garden and
get involved in that conversation and just
[SPEAKER_05]: staying open-minded as just as a way of
being a living classroom but also
[SPEAKER_05]: promoting other issues and student
well-being is a pretty important one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hand this over to Don who
will talk about NatureRx.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Erika and I'm really pleased to
have this opportunity to talk about an
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative with which we've been involved
for a couple of years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact it was a meeting of the land
subcommittee of the president's
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable campus committee where Marian
Krasny, a professor in natural resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: David Cutter, the university landscape
architect and I got together on the side
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were collectively bemoaning the
fact that there were so few efforts on
[SPEAKER_01]: campus to really encourage students to
spend time outdoors and one of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually I'm not even sure at this
point who it was, had heard about an
[SPEAKER_01]: effort that a group of progressive
physicians in the Washington DC area had
[SPEAKER_01]: started in conjunction with the National
Park Service and that partnership led to
[SPEAKER_01]: something called Nature Prescriptions in
which these physicians were for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: who were suffering from anxiety or extreme
stress or obesity related issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually writing prescriptions
for those individuals to spend time out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the local national parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The contribution by the Park Service was
to develop very detailed descriptions of
[SPEAKER_01]: each of their holdings in the greater DC
area, what types of natural features were
[SPEAKER_01]: present, how difficult the paths were to
walk on, how you can access them by car or
[SPEAKER_01]: public transportation and this seemed to
us like a great model for transferring to
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was at that point that we started to
organize a group of faculty, staff,
[SPEAKER_01]: clinicians from Gannett and graduate and
undergraduate students under the theme of
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature RX at Cornell and as you can see
our very simple goal is to reduce stress
[SPEAKER_01]: and thereby increase physical and mental
health in students through their
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement with nature and hopefully
through that engagement to cultivate in
[SPEAKER_01]: students an increased depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the two intervening years since we
first created this group we have achieved
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of goals, we've done a lot of
research, we've discovered that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: national group that calls itself Nature RX
Terra Mater and if you Google Nature RX
[SPEAKER_01]: you will see that they have very very
funny videos that are intended for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see something beautiful and
all you can think about is Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: filters you may need to spend more time
out in nature and both of the videos that
[SPEAKER_01]: that group has developed thus far are in
that sort of light hearted vein but with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very serious message that we all need to
spend more time out in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel that in promoting nature to
students we need to focus on some easily
[SPEAKER_01]: graspable benefits that the time in nature
will provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are talking about the need to be
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you worried about sluggishness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Time outdoors is one of the best
predictors of being physically active
[SPEAKER_01]: which can help to maintain healthy heart,
healthy weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that appeals to
students.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you preparing for an exam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Time that you spend in nature enhances
cognitive functioning and attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes time out in nature can be better
than an hour of cramming before a prelim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you feeling isolated which is as Erica
was explaining a very common cause of
[SPEAKER_01]: stress and anxiety among students.
[SPEAKER_01]: So find a walking running or hiking club.
[SPEAKER_01]: Research suggests that nature is a social
magnet that draws people together and
[SPEAKER_01]: fosters social interaction and get well
and this really is the essence of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: are focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeling bad just take a short
daily walk to improve your feeling of
[SPEAKER_01]: well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in what ways are we carrying out this
nature RX approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: One that was very interesting and very
successful this past fall is that Sonya
[SPEAKER_01]: Skelly led a first year student class
called Take It Outside in which each week
[SPEAKER_01]: the student enrollees were led by a
different Cornell expert to explore one of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell's magnificent natural areas in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working for several months on a
CU in nature app and website and very
[SPEAKER_01]: recently we were really gratified that the
IT team at Student Services has taken over
[SPEAKER_01]: the further development of this app and
website and we're going to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: actively and heavily promoting those and
I'll talk a bit more about that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we're quite excited about
is that in following up on that Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: DC model the clinicians at Cornell Health
what we have known as Gannett in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: are now actually writing paper
prescriptions that they hand out to
[SPEAKER_01]: students that say nature is beneficial to
you we want you to go out in nature and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they can check boxes once a week
twice a week four times a week and the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinicians at Gannett are very interested
in conducting a study of those students
[SPEAKER_01]: who have received these prescriptions to
see what impact it has on them over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are starting to promote the benefits of
time and nature in the ways that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just explaining through various media.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I'm an old faculty member so I
don't really know what students follow
[SPEAKER_01]: these days but we've discovered there's
something called Slope Media which has
[SPEAKER_01]: both a paper publication and an online
constantly changing website and blog so we
[SPEAKER_01]: have an interview set up later this week
with one of the editors at Slope Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also working with members of the
Student Assembly to get an article in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the undergraduate students that
Marsha Eames Sheaveley worked with last
[SPEAKER_01]: fall did a comprehensive study of every
course offered at Cornell to see which
[SPEAKER_01]: ones are currently utilizing nature to
enhance their teaching which ones could
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from greater use of time outdoors
and which ones are never going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in early discussions with faculty
in the Department of Communications about
[SPEAKER_01]: building a research project around
messaging of encouraging students to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: time outdoors to see how different forms
of messaging different messages themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: will have impact and we have a meeting
this coming Saturday in which we've
[SPEAKER_01]: invited students student representatives
from organizations across campus to come
[SPEAKER_01]: together and to advise us on how we can
make the NatureRx efforts more effective
[SPEAKER_01]: more impactful for all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the earliest things that or
earliest efforts in our NatureRx
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative was the development of a campus
map by David Cutter our university
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape architect in which he pointed
out some of the key natural areas on
[SPEAKER_01]: campus like Beebe Lake and both Cascadilla
and Fall Creek gorges.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of the jumping off point for
us to work with a graduate student in
[SPEAKER_01]: information sciences to develop an app
called See You in Nature that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the natural areas that are managed
by Cornell Plantations as well as natural
[SPEAKER_01]: areas in the center of campus like We
Stinky Glen, Tiger Glen and as of last
[SPEAKER_01]: week the Liberty Hyde Bailey Conservatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you can see a couple of the pages
from that app and the IT specialist from
[SPEAKER_01]: Student Services who I was mentioning is
now working on the further development of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and a companion website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea here is not to have students
be studying this app or website on their
[SPEAKER_01]: iPhones while they're out in nature but
rather to have them become familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: the spectacular natural sites that exist
here at Cornell and to learn how far it is
[SPEAKER_01]: from their dorm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a new feature on the
website in which a user can say how far am
[SPEAKER_01]: I from the closest natural area right now
and it will tell how many minutes the walk
[SPEAKER_01]: is to that site and how to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: An effort we were involved with this past
November with President Beth Garrett who
[SPEAKER_01]: is in our thoughts was also called Take It
Outside and it was a walk around Bee Bee
[SPEAKER_01]: Lake and to the Plantations Winter Garden
for students and members of both the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell and local community and through
NatureRx we anticipate running more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more events like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple events to just get people out in
nature and to find how close and how
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive and how enjoyable it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a shot from the Take It
Outside class that Sonia Skelly ran this
[SPEAKER_01]: past fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here is another shot and one of the things
about getting out in nature is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to do it in all types of weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see the students were going
down the gorge with Sarah Fiorello and
[SPEAKER_01]: were mostly prepared for that in terms of
their clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'd like to say in wrapping this
up is that we have simultaneously both a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very highly stressed and anxious
student body and the statistics that Erica
[SPEAKER_01]: was sharing earlier bear those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The counselors from the CAPS program at
Cornell Health Counseling and
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychological Services indicate that
between 18 and 20 percent of all
[SPEAKER_01]: undergraduates seek their support each
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an enormous number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the same time we have this very
stressed student body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have one of the most beautiful
campuses in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right next to the engineering quad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel that we have this incredible
opportunity to use the natural beauty of
[SPEAKER_01]: our campus of Cornell plantations to
entice students outside and to contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to their overall well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions for Erica or myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this kind of weird question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the stress is created under a
natural environment would pursuing nature
[SPEAKER_00]: still be a way to release your stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example if this might not be
until New Year to a horticultural student
[SPEAKER_00]: because sometimes we work in the field or
collecting sample in the forest for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long time and that creates the stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great question and I think
that time and nature can have certain
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One as you point out is if you're there
really doing work in order to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: work completed can be stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another is that if you're not certain of
the route that you're following it's easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to become stressed about finding your way
back to the starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recall that when I was in Costa Rica
several years ago there was a program to
[SPEAKER_01]: get kids from within San Jose capital city
who had spent no time in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: To just step into woods and that in itself
was very stressful for them because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: such an unfamiliar environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just becoming familiar and comfortable
with nature is often the first step.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a matter of mindfulness of
what you're choosing to focus on or moving
[SPEAKER_05]: your attention off of the research onto
the less demanding environment around you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a choice I guess of letting
yourself get off of one thing and continue
[SPEAKER_04]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take me a five minute break from the data
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like, like you were saying,
it's stressful when people sometimes who
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the middle of nature just step into
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've often thought that incorporating some
kind of identification skills like just go
[SPEAKER_04]: hand in hand because I always say you walk
into any person or any person who doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: spend time in nature will walk into the
kitchen and identify everything in the
[SPEAKER_04]: kitchen and no one talks out of place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet in nature they don't know what's safe,
what's not safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their environment is safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think about how maybe to
incorporate or you think that's important?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was definitely the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: One study was that the natural areas,
the more wild areas were not approached
[SPEAKER_05]: because they were afraid of them or just
didn't know about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they were trying to get at the
idea of the presentation and the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were actually, people took time to
describe these places to actually make
[SPEAKER_05]: them more familiar.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would be used more and also in the
survey that students were made raised that
[SPEAKER_05]: concern that they wouldn't be safe or many
different types of concern.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think taking that time to speak to the
students and interpret what these places
[SPEAKER_05]: are and what they're going to find there
and also teaching them about nature and
[SPEAKER_05]: learning about what plants are.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you know, the more you see,
the more you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: From your survey data, it seemed like
there was a pretty strong correlation
[SPEAKER_03]: between time spent outdoors and
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that causational?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a chicken and egg thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you love nature?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you spend time outdoors or the other
way around?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do they both feed back into each other?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did think about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what I was trying to at least
argue was that if a love of nature can be
[SPEAKER_05]: established then there will be a greater
use of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as which causes which, I don't
know, sometimes for some it might be
[SPEAKER_05]: greater knowledge and hence being more
familiar with something creates that love
[SPEAKER_05]: enjoyment of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: For others it might be that love draws
them to want to learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is a given to me and I don't
know the answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geneva, any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Al?
[SPEAKER_03]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll take one more question.
Phil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting back to the question of being out
in a wilder area might be stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that could be an example of
how important it is having smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: more controlled gardens on campus could be
truly beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: A small garden where you're not going to
get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: A small garden that is obviously man-made
construction close to your building but
[SPEAKER_02]: still would have the benefit of being
around trees, being around plants for this
[SPEAKER_02]: five or ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely and I think there really isn't,
at least some of the data was trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: show that it didn't matter if it was urban
nature or more rural nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just any amount of green really was
beneficial so taking it in more wide-sized
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces, definitely places right around
buildings seem to be very popular and so
[SPEAKER_05]: easy to get to that I think the use of
access is a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely there's a value to these
smaller spaces and hopefully campuses can
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe keep cultivating them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Donna and Erica.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
you
