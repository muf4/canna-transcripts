[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 22 years ago, this week,
we held the first U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open at the Beth Page Black, and I had the
pleasure of being on the crew as a much
[SPEAKER_01]: younger man back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, this was during the height
of the Tiger Woods, you know, period of
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance that, you know, Scottie
Scheffler may be going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we start them out young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ashley Binkley is a golf athlete,
and he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, superintendent in Canada
and has these two loved one lovely kid who
[SPEAKER_01]: she's been showing on Twitter forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you just love seeing this
walking out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, on a sad note, there were a
lot of passings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think for those of us again
that have dogs, losing them is really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's great that people share
these things, especially for men who
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes have a tough time expressing
emotions around these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animals seem to be a place where men have
figured out how to at least express some
[SPEAKER_01]: emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us that have dogs know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, Carl, I'm going to take the
weather for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to set you up for us to
transition to rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit about the weather as
we normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've seen a cooling pattern on the
weather, we're also seeing some cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in the soils, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really pushing warm and really the
only places that are warm left are down
[SPEAKER_01]: where rich is and along the metro New York
area along the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, that represents how much it
was cooler than normal last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been on a warming trend over in
general, but cooler than normal means it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been cooler than we'd expected to be over
the last 30 years, particularly inland,
[SPEAKER_01]: warmer to the north and a little bit more
to the south.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is allowing us to still be ahead
of last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for people that go year to
year, seeing how far we are ahead of last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, but also recognizing we're right
around normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the region based on the 30 year
average is normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think climate change makes these
things a little bit more difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: really interpret and get a feel for,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we've been warming so
significantly over the last two decades,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's normal is not as easy to understand
as maybe it used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our conference call this morning
and we have people talking about how dry
[SPEAKER_01]: it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden, boom,
we have people talking about how wet it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what you see is this
widespread drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drew a line from Pittsburgh to
Boston, you'd see in a couple hundred mile
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter of that, width of that,
you'd see a really big dry trend the last
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other places, almost everybody else
got about an inch of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a real split in the moisture
across the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Carl, here's something I want to talk
to you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a loamy soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the lawn watering tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a loamy soil down in the metro New
York area over the last month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I put the pin in Central Park
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at this thing and I got a
normal native soil like Zach Holm would
[SPEAKER_01]: have at Central Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking at this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first thought is, I'm not sure I
would have watered once in the last month
[SPEAKER_01]: because while I did have, you know,
let me get the pencil here for those
[SPEAKER_01]: watching us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have three days where I was in some
severe, as we're defining it now,
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another day where it touched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a couple of days were in it,
a couple of days more I'm in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've noticed, Carl, is I'm always
coming out of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really persisting in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like I'm going to come out of
it again this coming week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, moisture is the conversation as we
reach the summer solstice, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sun is highest in the sky and we
get the most ET.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at this, are you
seeing what I'm seeing that maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have irrigated my lawn in the
last month?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I agree with you,
Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen the visible stress like
that may be indicated on this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is the model is based on
these maximum allowable deficits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, you know, you have your
field capacity and then if you drop that
[SPEAKER_00]: down 70%, in theory, that's when we might
expect some stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think our model early in the season
is probably over predicting that stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had a nice amount of moisture this
whole spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've said on our conference call
this morning, man, it's felt wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe part of that is the root depth
is really deep too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our rooting depth from the
spring rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our roots can access a larger column of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we get into this, you know,
quote unquote, severe plant stress phase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the model, hey, maybe our roots are
actually deeper than this model is
[SPEAKER_00]: estimating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not actually seeing stress when
we predict it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if we pick up this hot and dry spell
that we're going to have, move it into
[SPEAKER_00]: late August or September when we've lost
rooting depth, that's when I think we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see this severe stress actually
play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil moisture thing is the
fascinating part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just soil moisture,
but it's soil where that rooting is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is good to know because on
the model, if you go to the website,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll actually see if you were setting it
and forgetting it starting in May 1st,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have put a fair amount of water
down already four inches or so in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: month and really not needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the kind of thing where I think
we're trying to drive here with this
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as Carl mentioned, and we know the
heat stress is going to be building,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the 18th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see it's coming across the
region next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we have high temperatures
that persist and high humidity that
[SPEAKER_01]: persists in the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as soon as you start talking about
high temperature and high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: Carl, we're talking about diseases,
but it looks like brown patch in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular is confined to the southern end
of the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know you've got a rant about this
with regard to pesticide use, and this
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a perfect setup for our guests
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Carl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so one of the things, when I first
started working with you, Frank,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go to these conferences and I wanted
to learn about how we apply pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, life cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in a seminar at the GCSAA show,
and Bruce Clark was going through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural practices for dollar spot
prevention or brown patch or anthracnose
[SPEAKER_00]: and spends a lot of time on the cultural
practices, the irrigation, the fertility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there were no questions from the
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally at the end, where we get
to chemical control, ho baby, the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions come flooding in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was marking them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh my God, there's 20 questions
on chemicals and none on the cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I think that sort of mentality
is what people end up sort of getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: in the turf industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank, you studied this at Bethpage Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we manage golf courses, this is a
picture of, I think, the blue or the green
[SPEAKER_00]: course here, but we need pesticides in
some quantity to manage golf courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it is, at least in Long
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of pesticides we need,
that changes based on our expectations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did some work with the guys at
Wisconsin, that was the main question was
[SPEAKER_00]: what drives overall pesticide use on golf
courses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the turf grass varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the growing conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was it's the budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in effect, it's the expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you expect more at a golf course,
when your members pay $50,000 to get
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated into that golf course,
they're going to expect a blemish free
[SPEAKER_00]: golf course and you will use more
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you spend more, you spray more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the governor of pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, when we look at the
parts of the golf course that make up sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of the majority of that pesticide use,
it's the large areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fairways, large scale rough
applications that will really drive that
[SPEAKER_00]: overall total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting when we look at
pesticide records from a mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: course, the greens are not a whole lot
different from some of those high end
[SPEAKER_00]: places, but they don't spray the fairways
and a high end place sprays the fairways
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 times or 12 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what shoots up those
pesticide numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we zoomed out, we got pesticide
records from different areas of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We expected different sort of levels of
pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at Texas or Florida or
the Midwest, compared to us up here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast, man, pesticide use wasn't that
different across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expected more from the climates,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, maybe different climates,
different temperatures, different growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season lengths would change pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the US, it's about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we got records from other
countries, courses in Denmark or Norway or
[SPEAKER_00]: the UK, wow, they use a lot less
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably not because of
climate, it's probably because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory climate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have access to way fewer pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking easily in order of magnitude
fewer pesticides and that restricts their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and Ben talked on the show last
week about some of the regulations here in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, the birds and bees bill and
neonic bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think our turf industry gets really
sort of defensive about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last week, you guys talked really well
about the science behind, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in turf, neonics aren't that bad,
but in seed coated treatments,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, there is a high risk to pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tough when the science isn't sort
of leading the legislative approach,
[SPEAKER_00]: but often we'll get defensive whether the
science is leading or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Spider-Man meme, you're pointing,
our industry likes to point the fingers
[SPEAKER_00]: at, hey, we're doing good, what about that
one over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've looked at this a little bit,
the ag, we'll point to ag, ag will point
[SPEAKER_00]: to golf courses as excessive users.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at some pesticide records
that is part of that research a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, golf course turf is about equal
with great production in terms of our
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticide use, apples, we see more
pesticide use in apple orchards and
[SPEAKER_00]: potatoes, holy smokes, paint it white,
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about that turf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use borathalonil a bunch in potato
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do some of that, but I think
what I come back to is one of my mentors
[SPEAKER_00]: and Frank, you spent a lot of time with
her, Jennifer Grant, would really always
[SPEAKER_00]: just look inward, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of pointing the finger at
other people, really asking the question,
[SPEAKER_00]: she'd be very direct with superintendent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why did you spray that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone couldn't explain
themselves, she'd be like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the heck, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't explain why you did it,
do you really need that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a good question to
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask this all the time of myself is,
do I need to be doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can come up with a good reason
and I can rationalize it, when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and you guys will talk about
disease control probably here in a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to sort of be able to diagnose
the disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you send it to Rich and Rich says,
yes, you have X, Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to treat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you can't really sort of
rationalize that, and that's the great
[SPEAKER_00]: part about Jen and her IPM background was,
hey, if you can't rationalize it,
[SPEAKER_00]: why are you wasting your time on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And was that time and money better spent
on something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, Carl, this is really the
perfect transition to the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: when we talk about why, because everybody
learns this.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some form of pathology, that you have a
pathogen, a susceptible host, and all
[SPEAKER_01]: you're waiting for is the suitable
environment unless, you know, you expect
[SPEAKER_01]: something to blow in like a cutworm,
an army worm, or a gray leaf spot that
[SPEAKER_01]: blows in maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's waiting for the host too,
but in general, you're waiting for the
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we talked about this,
Carl, as you said in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Rich, you were involved in this
research many years ago when we were using
[SPEAKER_01]: your records and other diagnostic records
to just determine when are samples coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kinds of trends are we seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does our model say?
[SPEAKER_01]: This was back in early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were, again, much younger
men.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen a shift in seasonal things,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to bring you in, Rich,
I don't know, everybody knows you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: biker, riding your how many miles?
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand, 10,000 miles a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many are you doing now a year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about around 10,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm down now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a little more rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you just attended the Dead
at the Sphere, which I know you're avidly
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoying live music, but at the same time,
I noticed this also when you were a
[SPEAKER_01]: younger man, you're well supported by
Sabrina in the diagnostic lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big shout out to all the diagnostic
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's our questions for today,
Rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we've been working together a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sort of curious about the trends
over the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you are dependent on
samples coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you know, your institution,
Murphy and Clark, did that anthracnose
[SPEAKER_01]: work many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure, you know, you are getting a
lot more samples before they identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put a little bit more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to watch your growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to sand a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get as many anthracnose samples?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much have your diagnostics changed
based on some of the research that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: done to maybe help guys identify things
themselves a little bit better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great it's a great
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthracnose is an excellent example of how
research can solve problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we used to I guess it was 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of anthracnose samples that I
would get was about 36 percent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: total turf samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was somewhere around 200
a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last season, we got 14 anthracnose
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it pretty it pretty much
wrecked the business for us as
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnosticians, because if you follow the
guidelines, you know, and it was a decade
[SPEAKER_02]: or so of research by a whole bunch of
really good pathologists, it eliminates
[SPEAKER_02]: the risk for that particular disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just don't get the samples now.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So research undermines your business
model, which I think is a good point to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also interested maybe in what you
see with the superintendents that do
[SPEAKER_01]: submit samples or that you speak with,
because you're on the road chatting a fair
[SPEAKER_01]: amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Carl and I and you've been
involved in our forecast models here at
[SPEAKER_01]: Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We as Carl have said, they're all wrong,
but they're useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering how much you see about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, how much how much is there more
spraying going on than there used to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that related to different products
or is it related to being a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more averse to risk?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like what we've talked about
recently, that how people have decided
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to spray preventively eight
times for pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of behavioral changes have you
seen among superintendents over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times I think that those of
us in this side of the business are more
[SPEAKER_02]: like psychiatrists or psychologists than
pathologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, guys, depending on where they
are and we talk about the higher end and
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger budgets mean more spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the higher end superintendents,
the higher end superintendents,
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher end superintendents that sprays
are still spraying quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I remember in the the heyday of
anthracnose that many superintendents
[SPEAKER_02]: would spray on four or five day intervals
even, you know, not knowing they needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would have solved their problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it's not uncommon to see weekly
fungicide treatments on greens and teas
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they spray more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the risk aversion is higher,
you know, moving from the high end to the
[SPEAKER_02]: low end, even the mid range and lower end
guys are getting pressure for higher
[SPEAKER_02]: quality grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they spray more and then, you know,
to kind of roll this into there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of chemicals now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's remarkable, really,
what I've seen come to market in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years that we didn't have when I
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there and there may be softer and not
as persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be why we're spraying
weekly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still think, you know, if you're
spraying on 14 days, that's pretty darn
[SPEAKER_02]: good coverage, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need a fungicide that that
knocks the crap out of a fungus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for maybe 21 or 28 days before
it recovers its growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to spray it every seven
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even the most risk averse person at 14
days is still covering really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let's stay on the Pythium root
rot thing, because this has really been in
[SPEAKER_01]: my craw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I I banter with Carl all the
time about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's come up recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a thought among pathologists that
maybe we shouldn't be spraying for Pythium
[SPEAKER_01]: root rot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, listen, let's let's make sure
everybody understands what we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have saturated root zones and you
have stress turf to begin with,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut low, you know, you know, a lot of
traffic, you get these wet conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even have to be hot,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich, you'll get Pythium root rot in those
anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And temperature doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, go back to Eric Nelson,
you know, in 1990, you know, he was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about pathogenicity at 40 degrees,
you know, and causing root infections with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the same pathogens that cause
Pythium blight on the foliage,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, you know, super saturated soils,
poor internal drainage, extra rain,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that creates a condition for this or
these workers because they're out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're not really true fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I don't think everybody
needs to be spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I think you need to be fixing your
drainage or your irrigation protocol or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're going to get more bang from
your buck from from then starting to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: at 50 degrees or 55 degrees and spraying
all season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're seeing it more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get we see we see a more preventive
Pythium root rot applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, down south,
you know, North Carolina, South Carolina,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe there's more call for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the programs that come out of
the southern researchers might work well
[SPEAKER_02]: down there, but maybe be excessive up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I don't I'm going to go I'm going to
go a little bit further with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are more risk averse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem every even at the mid and low
level, they're expect everybody is
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting higher quality conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're having to spray more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering just my sarcastic view,
as you know, from working with me a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I was very surprised with the rash
of nematode concerns we had years ago that
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed to be well timed with the release
of new nematocides from two big chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a very interesting
correlation causation situation going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering about the regular visits
that our distributor reps make to our
[SPEAKER_01]: clientele may be saying, boy, you should
probably get that Pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not suggesting impropriety,
but I'm suggesting more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your thought maybe superintendents
are barraged a little bit with these
[SPEAKER_01]: things that might be a concern and that
drives their use a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be careful now, because I know I'm trying
to be two people listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to throw anybody under the
bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, there's two there's two things I
see, you know, new product and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the marketing push for the new
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is superintendents who are
so busy with multiple tasks, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: personnel problems, greens committee,
you know, basically say to the sales reps,
[SPEAKER_02]: just sell me what you think I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that way they don't have to
really think about it in the way we would
[SPEAKER_02]: want them to from an IPM, you know,
from Jennifer Grant's standpoint,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so they get into program programs
that may have been worked out by a
[SPEAKER_02]: research scientist that are picked up by
the companies and they might not need any
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so we'll end this part with being
thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're more thoughtful, there
appears to be some new things on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this new pathogen from John
Ingwijato at UConn that I know you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, that you've been talking
about and also the morning you commented
[SPEAKER_01]: as you hang out with molecular biologists
like Mingyi, your new turfgrass
[SPEAKER_01]: pathologist who replaced Dr. Clark,
they're sort of throwing a wrench in the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole pathogen ID thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we really know what we thought we
know or we don't know what we don't know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's become more confusing
because, you know, now with with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to sequence the the genes of these
organisms, we're starting to see
[SPEAKER_02]: differences, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so it was just to start with a new
pathogen that John's looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even we can't name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: John suggested a name and Mingyi did some
work with the same pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that the matches they're
getting are aren't close enough to to know
[SPEAKER_02]: what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something new, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so this is good because we don't have a
lot of time left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know this can be a very lengthy
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it academic or are these species
potentially going to relate to the need
[SPEAKER_01]: for different control measures?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's two answers for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on which one, it could be
academic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the John John's pathogen looks a
lot like brown ring patch, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or wadia patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know DMI fungicides work really
well for wadia and DMI fungicides John
[SPEAKER_02]: said to name one Max Dima works really
well, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we're we don't we just realize
it's a new pathogen because John looked a
[SPEAKER_02]: little closer one time, you know.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other the other issue is with these
root infecting patch diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we know, of course, that was
having trouble with their summer patch
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would always suggest to them that it
was timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we found was it was a closely
related pathogen that was it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: magnetoporthiopsis, this slopeyomyces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so that pathogen has been
implicated as the cause of take all invent
[SPEAKER_02]: grass, you know, in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so so what we're finding is that
pathogen grows at a lower soil
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we are missing the timing,
but we should have started at fifty five
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees, not sixty five degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're finding that in POA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're finding it in bent grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also finding this magnetoporthiopsis
myrii that's supposed to be in fine
[SPEAKER_02]: fescues in POA on putting greens that are
telling me the same story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Figuring out exactly which one of these
and Mingyi says to me, he says,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they get good control at sixty five
degrees, then it's magnetoporthiopsis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't tell them to start at fifty
five degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but so this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can't banter around just calling it
like the summer patch syndrome because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's multiple pathogens here and we're
we still have a little bit to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, coming back full
circle, it seems like diagnostics are
[SPEAKER_01]: still going to play an important role
because we're going to have new pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Become thoughtful.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are interested, you know, they can
take samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have pythium root rot that I have to
worry about here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find pythium everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still a role for people to send
samples in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's sending you good turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're having trouble with their root
pathogens, this seems to be something that
[SPEAKER_01]: remains difficult to diagnose that it'd be
really good to get it in professional
[SPEAKER_01]: hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we can look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm a classically trained
pathologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was 30 something years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at morphology and all the old
school stuff and partner with the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that have the new technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so what we're trying to do is
bring in some of these these newer
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies in order to separate this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to start offering
molecular characterization of these root
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens through the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the problem is, you know,
I can tell you in like 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes me a month, you know,
to isolate and do all that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so, you know, that'll change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll develop assays, I would imagine,
over time, won't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's there's stuff that's
quicker, you know, and I think once they
[SPEAKER_02]: get get a clear picture of what we're
looking at, then they'll start working on
[SPEAKER_02]: speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in my lab, it's always
about quick and dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and it'll get to that, you know,
because in other crop systems and other
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens, they're already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Carl, do we have anything for our
fine guest here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no we have no gifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This ain't the price is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gift is just being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The points are made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The points are made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the scores don't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich, rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question I had was I don't see a whole
lot of people testing things on their
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery areas or their, you know,
skip areas, check plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a whole lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder how often do you recommend
that for people who are spraying a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you'll look at their program and
go, I don't know if you need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do people play around enough on areas to
the side that they have experimental
[SPEAKER_00]: areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Danelli comes to mind as a guy who's
done this with varieties and roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a little bit of that, but mostly
the pressure, the risk aversion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, nobody's willing to even throw
out a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, and it's we've been
teaching this sort of stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment evaluations forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're treat we're teaching
modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're we're we're teaching mindful
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Precision applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And underneath it all, I think,
is this the risk averse high salary has to
[SPEAKER_02]: be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still driving everything,
guys in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that top down stress is certainly
what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what what we're talking about here
is a cultural thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's the expectations are human
derived.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science and the climate don't determine
expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a first principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's humans deciding that needs
to be perfect and and their willingness to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the other part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this is happening if there's not
willingness to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also is the economics that golf is
doing pretty good, especially golf these
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would see I even see it in school
grounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're willing to spend money
on synthetic turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more more grounds and landscapes
want to be manicured, not just groomed and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes they worry about chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Carl, are we there?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that season five of the Cornell
turf show is in the books and maybe next
[SPEAKER_00]: season we'll focus on people and not
grass, because that's what it always comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always comes down to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as you don't like interacting with
people, it ends up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, everyone, for those who've
listened live, who watch the videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: who listen on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we will definitely be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Carl.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you real soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich, good seeing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk to you next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
You.
You.
