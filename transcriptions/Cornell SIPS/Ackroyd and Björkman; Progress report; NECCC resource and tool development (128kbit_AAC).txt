[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, today I am going to provide an
update about what some of the members of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Northeast Cover Crops Council have
been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the first thing that I want to
emphasize is that it's not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: members of the Northeast Cover Crops
Council anymore working with and designing
[SPEAKER_02]: web tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actively reaching out to the other
regions, Midwest Cover Crops Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the states in green,
and then the states in red or the southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover Crops Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you may know that I am a postdoc
in the lab with Dr. Steven Mersky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Mersky is a bit of a nexus for some of
these efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I just want to emphasize that there
are many efforts underway.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to reduce redundancy while at
the same time, maximizing the usability of
[SPEAKER_02]: these tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have many collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the teams overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have many tools under development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the upper right hand, my right hand
picture is a picture of a Cover Crop
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethnomics Calculator developed by NRCS
that we are trying to refine into a
[SPEAKER_02]: nicer...
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these things start life as an
Excel sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, we want to change them from Excel
sheets running on macros to something
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a little more polished than someone
who controls the web.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be familiar with and would be able to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a seeding rate calculator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with Paul Salon on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steven, Dr. Mersky has a really involved
project where they are looking at water
[SPEAKER_02]: and nutrient balances in the soil and
trying to see how Cover Crops impact that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those sensors are actually
uploading to a web tool where a farmer in
[SPEAKER_02]: real time can click and see what's
happening in their field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the bottom right, my right picture is
a small part of a screenshot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the tool that I want to talk with
you today about and the tool that I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to pitch to you and ask for your
assistance with today is the Cover Crop
[SPEAKER_02]: Selector tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the Cover Crop Selector tool started
out as a product of the Midwest Cover
[SPEAKER_02]: Crops Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have generously offered us the
opportunity to modify it for use in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really neat about this is in
spite of the fact that the interface looks
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit dated, this was a cutting
edge tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows farmers to put in a lot of site
specific information and it changes the
[SPEAKER_02]: output based on what they put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's not quite right, a Cover Crop
prescription, but it comes closer than
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the more general information that
a farmer might find if he's just looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for an extension full of things trying to
find the answer to what should I plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll work in my system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, an example of how this changes based
on what a farmer puts in is, do I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: light?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I picked Michigan and I picked Van
Buren County here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Van Buren is a relatively southern
county.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, as you can see, we've got a nice
long stretch where they can plant cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a more northern county, that stretch is
a lot smaller and this output will vary
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what the farmer puts in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this output is pretty straightforward
for us to generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pull frost dates, the macro runs,
it does its job, and voila, it alters the
[SPEAKER_02]: output depending on which county they pick
and what the frost dates for that county
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, my bitch to you guys is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more involved information that is
heavily reliant on both data and expert
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion for us to generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for instance, here we've got the
ratings for the different cover crops for,
[SPEAKER_02]: in this case, how good of a soil builder
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these ratings are entirely based on
the guts of the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what we do when we're modifying this
is we ask a group to react to ratings for
[SPEAKER_02]: a state that has already been done that's
nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to change them to better match what is
true in their state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the ways this process is going
to differ in the northeast from in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Midwest is that we're not going state by
state, we're going zone by zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of tiny states in the
northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be calling Brandon,
you know, four times, Rhode Island,
[SPEAKER_02]: Connecticut, can you help me with your
work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Brandon's going to say, oh my
goodness, my schedule, no, I can't help
[SPEAKER_02]: you with farm state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he might be willing to help us with
zone popper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm going to actually send around a
sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a signup sheet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are asking that if you're
interested in potentially helping provide
[SPEAKER_02]: expert opinion for this to give us your
contact information, your state or region,
[SPEAKER_03]: and your area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of what's in this tool is
very detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, for instance, if there's someone
who is an expert on nitrogen, dynamic,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we could ask them to just help with
that part of the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're someone who's an expert on what
cover crops do to disease, then you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to wade through all of this data to
help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just help us with your area of
expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are not going to react well to
the notion that this is based on expert
[SPEAKER_02]: opinions we came with.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Midwest, I helped with their tool
for multiple states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found is that there are very
big numbers of knowledge gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't necessarily realize that
knowledge gaps exist until we go to rate,
[SPEAKER_02]: say, canola on how good of a soil builder
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly, did we discover that,
first off, how did we define soil builder
[SPEAKER_02]: again?
[SPEAKER_02]: And second off, there's not good data in
the literature yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a iterative process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we gain those data, we will
certainly go through and update these
[SPEAKER_02]: tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: But assistance from our stakeholders is
vital for this initial effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I expect to start this process during
the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, if you're curious about when
you'll be getting an email and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: moved from me, it would be sometime this
winter, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do thank you for your assistance if
you're willing to provide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that I have helped in a very short
time to let you know a little bit more how
[SPEAKER_02]: this tool was put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want this tool to be as usable as
possible for farmers and to be as sound as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible in terms of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not sure how I'm doing for time,
but does anyone want to ask me a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: questions or shall we let Tom speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot to hit you with,
I do a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Victoria described the framework for the
tool that's being developed for the
Northeast Covered Crop Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of discussions about how do
you gain more gain on this that are
useful.
What we'll talk about in the discussion at
the end of this session is what are
characteristics that you need for this
tool to be valuable to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely in the design stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that is clear is that
this can interact with a lot of other
resources in online schools.
And that you can have a module from this
to show up in other pieces of software
that's being used for other reasons for
farm management, or vice versa.
You can have tools that are being
developed by people and incorporate them
into this covered crop collection.
So, if we go both directions, we've worked
out some of the technical aspects of that,
which seems to be quite solvable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show just a couple of
examples of add-ons that are available to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep you thinking about what kind of
equipment the collectors will use.
So,
[SPEAKER_01]: one is, this is about a 10-year-old thing
that I came up with that was designed
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for vegetable growers in New
York.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question we always run into with
covered crops is all this information out
there that's readily available to growers
that's not applicable to their situation.
So, I'm waiting to do that.
And so, it was set up as a website with a
simple address.
You select the management goal.
And you can see it's on the phone.
So, this is one feature that I think is
going to be essential.
More than half of this is on the website.
So, about half are on the phone,
and it keeps climbing.
That presents a presentation channel.
You can see there's not much information
on that.
Be sure to read.
So, yeah, so you select the management
goal, planning time.
Those are usually constraints that growers
have.
And so, this one provides the links of
them.
So, the Midwest Cover Crop tool,
that was across the top on the right,
to do the different functions that we've
built in.
So, it's very similar in that regard.
And then, this one has you kind of take
the vertical block there on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, the idea is to pick out some
choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, this was a design decision that's
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's based on the idea that you should
get down to relatively close to the
center.
So, there's a long list of potential
covered crops that could be used in the
entire region.
But for particular growers, it's going to
narrow it down pretty quickly.
So, one idea here is to narrow it down
[SPEAKER_01]: very quickly, and then you click on the
name of the thing, and you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: construction guide, or you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, those are just some interface
features.
Some characteristics of that may be
something you should be looking at to get
in the northeast, the region of the Cover
Crop tool, if you go down the line.
So, it would be interesting to get some of
your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, I'm going to show you one that is
brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this one live in the auto
farm, the big room that we were just in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Brian Belcher is there at the setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play with it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch over because I have
the online version going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one of the things that...
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one of the things that's true with
covered crops, they have a fairly narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: planting window.
You can persuade people that you shouldn't
wait until next week to plant it.
Now, this shows how quickly the planting
window closes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this plus the probability of the
covered crop
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the probability that you'll have the
successful covered crop and establishment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you see the dates down the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the nice thing about this is that
you do it for your location.
So, we have it set up right now,
but if you click on that, it opens the
app.
And if you want to see what it is on the
site, it goes into the climate database.
And I learned it's a great, excellent
climate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, even though it's grayed out,
it doesn't mean you don't.
You've got the excellent opportunity to
have that climate database continuing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas far and wide, the relevant covered
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we have three, because I haven't
had data for these three, but we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, talking this afternoon about where
these data come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you can see the curves go down there,
and all the lines at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's historic data from 1979 to the
present, and it shows our cutoff was 1,800
degree days from the planting date to a
hard freeze or mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you can see how much that varied
over the last 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any guidance in terms of the
probability, you know, how folks should
[SPEAKER_01]: interpret or make decisions based on
probability?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, on this one, we haven't gotten far
enough on that.
So, the way we dealt with that is,
you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what we considered a measure of
success in terms of providing a meaningful
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we decided to put that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we provided that interpretation data.
So, in terms of our general mechanism of
interpretation, that's how it did.
So, what we're leading up to the user in
this case is, what do you consider to have
enough cost?
You want to make sure you definitely will
have a good test, or, you know,
90 percent, are you still in your comfort
zone?
Or, in this case, does, you know,
it rained for a few days, and now you're
[SPEAKER_01]: up to August 23rd, and, you know,
only last week that you were ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now your odds are down to 47
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to rethink that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to maybe push it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's where this is focused on having
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part is actually not as easy to
change, because that is what comes out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anything that's climate-based,
the changing location, the changing
temperature threshold, those are good.
But what's successful turns out to be more
difficult to make sense of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and I think with Rye, that is going
to be particularly applicable,
because you have various different
expectations of what a Rye cover crop
might do.
So, if you're going to, if you're selling
it first thing in the springtime,
then as we, how much, how much group
growth have you gotten in the fall?
That's what matters.
So, that's a different criterion.
So,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are, so that, actually, particularly
with Rye, where there's a lot of data,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would make different, different
measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we have to integrate what you have
with the decision tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so the decision tool will
likely be less specific on date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in this case, it'll tell you that
it'll be the end sometime in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: August.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how far the bottom will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you're looking at, if you're not in
the middle of that far, you're kind of in
the spot, then you could go to something
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it might bear mentioning that
ultimately, you're hoping to put together
[SPEAKER_03]: a sample of what the technical cost is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you don't have to keep inputting data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you can go into the cover crop
selection tool and get a general sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: where the cover crop is most interested
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, in theory, eventually,
you want the tool to set up so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can choose what output you want to dump
into this tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you pick Rye and mustard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, you could further refine
your decision making based on the most
[SPEAKER_03]: specific planting information and finding
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, you're trying to pick a big
modular tool that basically will help you
[SPEAKER_00]: set up and minimize the amount of data
input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remembering where you are, knowing what
your weather was every day for the last
few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That part is not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little...
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 30-year record.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 15-year record.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, more recently, it's been that much
warmer in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important, as you mentioned,
to be able to change that tonnage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you can plant mustard on
September 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a hundred percent cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing a lot of other things,
other species...
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they build this, it would be good to
be able to have a way to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that the measures that we've
tested definitely have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
This one is definitely using mustard as a
single cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
