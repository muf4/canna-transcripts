[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next up are more research briefs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to be talking about weeds,
and then also the farmer data lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be introducing the next
speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we have Eric Youngerman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Eric was born and raised in the
rolling hills of the Berkshires.
[SPEAKER_06]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Western Mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming everyone knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric Youngerman joined the sustainable
property systems lab in 2022, where he's a
[SPEAKER_02]: research support specialist and a first
year PhD student.
[SPEAKER_02]: His work spans the Northeast, focusing on
advancing sustainable pest and disease
[SPEAKER_02]: management in organic cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the past two years, Eric has been
investigating the efficacy of integral
[SPEAKER_02]: mowing for weed control in soybean and dry
bean.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is particularly excited, I am too,
about its potential as a supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy for managing weeds in organic
no-till systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's going to talk first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just want to take the opportunity
to introduce the next speaker,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be done at the same time
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Louis Longchamps earned his PhD at
Laval University, working on site-specific
[SPEAKER_02]: weed management.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did his post-doctoral studies at
Colorado State University, working on
[SPEAKER_02]: precision nutrient seed and water
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an assistant professor of digital
agronomy at Cornell University,
[SPEAKER_02]: he explores the potential of observational
research and on-farm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dr. Longchamps is the current chair of
the on-farm experimentation community of
[SPEAKER_02]: the International Society of Precision
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, he's going to be talking about
the farmer data lab right after Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Eric, take it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that was a lot about me and Louis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Berkshires, did everybody know that was
from Massachusetts?
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt did not, so I'm just pointing that
out right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I assumed everybody here would know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so as Matt said, I'm a research
support specialist and first year graduate
[SPEAKER_06]: student.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be highlighting some of the
work that I've been doing with the Interim
[SPEAKER_06]: Mower and also some of the other students
in the lab, as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to go over the benefits
of cover cropping, I don't think,
[SPEAKER_06]: because we already have our benefits of
cover crop-based no-till.
[SPEAKER_06]: But primarily, I guess we like it because
it's soil benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Earlier, I've heard a lot of people asking
about what does it actually look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've seen some photos of roller
cropping.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have also talked about,
I guess, do we roll or plant and roll?
[SPEAKER_06]: In our lab, in our lab, we generally do it
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are rolling our material rod,
and then we're doing it all in one pass
[SPEAKER_06]: with a plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people in the back can't hear,
so you've got to stand in front of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really enjoyed this one to the
point that our lab has actually,
[SPEAKER_06]: with a lot of helpful people from this
group, has developed a no-till-planted
[SPEAKER_06]: soybean production guide.
[SPEAKER_06]: This guide is available in the back,
for those of you who are interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt's now standing next to the pod.
[SPEAKER_06]: And although we have highlighted a lot of
the benefits of erosion control or soil
[SPEAKER_06]: health, what we haven't really talked
about too much is how effective these
[SPEAKER_06]: models are at weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this case, we have amazing weed
suppression.
[SPEAKER_06]: You essentially see no weeds coming up
through that mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does this always happen though?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the question is, are there options
available for us to maintain that mulch
[SPEAKER_06]: biomass layer without disturbing the soil?
[SPEAKER_06]: So one option I think what a lot of people
do in this room, typically, which does
[SPEAKER_06]: involve some level of soil disturbance,
is high residue cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: High residue cultivation works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, it's typically used for when
we have too many weeds and we go in at the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the season.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard that people today talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now why is you, though, is you are
disturbing that mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're also disturbing your soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of a funny example,
because we don't really have that many
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're also ideally going to be tearing
up those weeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another option that we are especially
excited about, though, is interim mowing,
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's down to controlling the weeds
in a mulch system with literally no soil
[SPEAKER_06]: disturbance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can point out, oh, well,
what about, oh, it's also really good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sweep the name too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really like this interim mowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a couple other models out there
on the market, but we've collaborated with
[SPEAKER_06]: this group.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we like about it is there's five
ways with rotary mowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They enable us to mow too much between
anything that's 30 inch space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can adjust the cutting height with
two to six inches above the surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can use it until you are at risk
of canopy closure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we like this so much that a few years
back, a graduate student of ours,
[SPEAKER_06]: who has since moved on, compared that to
the interim mower with two other
[SPEAKER_06]: management properties.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the weeds after, which Vivian was
talking about earlier, as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: increased seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where we found, this is what
we did, was that interim mowing reduced
[SPEAKER_06]: mean biomass by 60% compared to the
non-treated control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was an awesome increase by 40%
in the yield.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was quite a conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we wanted to know, how does this
compare to more tillage-based practices
[SPEAKER_06]: like high-resin and cultivating?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we designed an experiment that's the
name of this, the talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interim mowing is a supplemental weed
management tool in organic sowing to
[SPEAKER_06]: evaluate interim mowing, weed management,
in crop yielding, both tillage-based
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation and organic sowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've presented our results from the
past three years, or three site years.
[SPEAKER_06]: This all took place up in a month's
period, research, farming, or learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of you might have seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You came to our field crop day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some pretty great soybeans out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: CRI was planted at 185 pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, did I know I put three million.
[SPEAKER_06]: Purely seeds per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we developed and ran a lot of seed
design in five periods.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rolled cereal rye with no additional weed
management.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rolled cereal rye with no additional weed
management.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rolled cereal rye with high-residue
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea behind this structure was we
wanted to increase, so as we were going
[SPEAKER_06]: down, we were increasing soil disturbance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal here is, how can we manage our
weeds with minimal disturbance?
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I just have a couple of pictures of
these treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're like, oh, that's what it looked
like.
[SPEAKER_06]: So rolled cereal rye with no additional
weed management, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We terminated our cereal rye at 17,
possibly 75 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in thesis, we just left it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as you can see, some gas,
and that has to do with some urgent issues
[SPEAKER_06]: with the deer damage.
[SPEAKER_06]: For our rolled cereal rye high-residue
cultivation, we used a John Deere,
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: 886.
[SPEAKER_06]: 886 high-residue cultivator, approximately
20-inch single sweep, which you can see on
[SPEAKER_06]: this side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did a one-square of the growing
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: We then also used our tilled cereal rye
and rolled cereal rye for growing
[SPEAKER_06]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So occurs, it happened twice per growing
season.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's underneath here in the
description at the top.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see pre-rowing and post-rowing in
till.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see quite a bit of reaction
above the weeds at the end for roselle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And same on the bottom, except this is in
our rolled treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I just started to roll the
cultivation pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we used our John Deere 900,
the standard sweep on the back,
[SPEAKER_06]: these finger wieners, as well as the
standard interval cultivator on the
[SPEAKER_06]: picture on the underside.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this occurred four times.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before I show the results, I want to
emphasize a few things.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is that there was a lot of variation
in the vial mass of the mold across the
[SPEAKER_06]: three different fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: So quite a bit of variation, whether it
actually is changing enough or,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you later, but I'll have to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So dominant weed was in the lab,
it was from agarweed, probably I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: about from the first few cells were in the
following two.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it feels like we had the most rye
biomass between what's anticipated or
[SPEAKER_06]: expected is that the greatest green
pressure or the least green pressure?
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically when we think about how much
mold is required, the standard gold
[SPEAKER_06]: standard was about 8,000 kilograms per
hectare.
[SPEAKER_06]: Transbreaker is probably about 9,000
pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So which field do you think had the
highest amount of green pressure?
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the biomass?
[SPEAKER_05]: A wish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is why they were so kind of really
cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because sometimes you can have a really
high amount of weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't go over this at the beginning,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can also have really high seed
density in your weeds, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_06]: in your soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you could end up having really high
numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first picture that I showed you was
a really nice looking field with no weed
[SPEAKER_06]: was field P, and the second one was field
A.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so another point to make is,
with the result I'm going to show you,
[SPEAKER_06]: we had really low weed pressure over the
last eight years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's hard to just find a ton of
weeds and then load.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's some, we anticipate some of
these results to be a little bit more blue
[SPEAKER_06]: than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would expect more clear results with
greater weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a pull across our site years.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the x-axis we have our old,
we have our treatments going from least
[SPEAKER_06]: disturbance to greatest disturbance,
and our weed biomass on the y-axis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the interesting thing about these
results is primarily they're all going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be increased weed biomass in our aerosol
treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So look at that later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And something else that I want to
highlight is how we actually sample our
[SPEAKER_06]: weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is just, you know what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: So typically when I'm live with most
researchers, I think most of them are
[SPEAKER_06]: sampling weed biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use a half-heater, a square plotter,
and we center along the row so that the
[SPEAKER_06]: row piece, which is this, have been
removed in these pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: We sample everything from that area and
then we report them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the inter-row mower, as I pointed out
earlier, has a 22 inch deck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now when we're including all of
this, we're kind of, we're including the
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds that have not been touched by that
inter-row mower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're a great band.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we did in addition to the entire
half-heater plotter is we divided it also
[SPEAKER_06]: into two inter-row zones.
[SPEAKER_06]: We combined those.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're excluding, and I have to make it
more, using the inter-row zone for these
[SPEAKER_06]: results.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we do that, we get something a
little different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now we see the whole inter-row
mowing is actually reduced.
[SPEAKER_06]: We reduce the weed biomass by 70% when
compared to our control.
[SPEAKER_06]: We still get really, like hardly anything,
but it's quite exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: On to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no difference between you two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're interested in, hey, can we get these
weeds out of here?
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you figure out how to do that,
then we can really kind of start looking
[SPEAKER_06]: at what we can do to improve it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in conclusion, inter-row mowing did
increase weed biomass until soybean
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: We think that's because primarily most of
the weeds within our area are going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: used for practices, annual practices,
but we're essentially just causing the
[SPEAKER_06]: different growth and growth and growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would not necessarily buy inter-row
mowing in till treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inter-row mowing did increase weed biomass
until soybean compared to the control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Inter-row mowing did increase inter-row
weed biomass until soybean compared to the
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we want is inter-row mowing can
potentially replace standard cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to have inter-row mowing for
effective weed control without impacting
[SPEAKER_06]: yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking at this, the kind of
inter-row mowing in organic no-till
[SPEAKER_06]: drivings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting about this is that
how inter-row mowing can not only control
[SPEAKER_06]: weeds, but also control weed seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we noticed with the late mowing,
so no mowing, early mowing, late mowing,
[SPEAKER_06]: and as data mowing, we noticed that the
weed seeds were reduced by up to 50%
[SPEAKER_06]: compared to the untreated control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're also removing seed seeds,
which is pretty, you don't have to think
[SPEAKER_06]: about that when we're just focusing on
weed control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in organic no-till corn,
this is another kind of seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the preliminary results from a large
experiment that's demonstrated once again
[SPEAKER_06]: that inter-row mowing can remove weed
biomass, but more externally in corn,
[SPEAKER_06]: based on this experiment, can also improve
your yields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question while we switch over to Dr.
Longshore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should just say that those were some
really good soybean yields that you were
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some high bean yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those corn yields that Eric was showing at
the end there, those were quite low,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those were averaged over a bunch of
treatments, some suboptimal treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were lower than what we would like
to see, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Question for Eric?
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious about the ability of the
inter-row mower to reduce G-Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit more about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the follow-up experiment,
in our drive-ins, the idea is that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: targeting weeds before they are flowered
and producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to analyze that or to measure that,
we put out pit bull traps that catch the
[SPEAKER_06]: most.
[SPEAKER_06]: We measured the production of about six
weeks of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then we noticed how many seeds are
being removed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are so many seeds being added to the
seed that are over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So removing any biomass would be removing
seeds, but it's actually quantitative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the quantitative data is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess one thing that we try to target
with the lake mowing is to do a dominant
[SPEAKER_06]: assessment of what weeds are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, okay, your most dominant weed is going
to be common ragweed.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to target that common ragweed
when it is only flowering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there are cases where that common
ragweed will still grow back and then
[SPEAKER_06]: almost tiller and put up little pyres.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're still reducing the number of
weeds in spite of the exact ratio of it by
[SPEAKER_06]: a large number.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a neat option to explore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this prevents the production of
those that have been going out and trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to destroy them.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why business logic is so cool,
because it's going to be preparing a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the critical evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dave.
Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Kristen, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it's my pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that this is the crowd that is
experimenting a lot, the conversation we
[SPEAKER_04]: had in Dean and Jake.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the discussion that happened
today, it all comforts me to see that this
[SPEAKER_04]: is the great crowd for this topic here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my background is precision agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've studied it over the last maybe 20
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And over those years, we developed ways to
capture the data, organize the data,
[SPEAKER_04]: and look at ways to interpret it to learn
from the spatial variability and all those
[SPEAKER_04]: layers of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And working with farmers, I kind of bought
into the idea of what would happen if we
[SPEAKER_04]: put the farmers themselves in the driver's
seat and use all that technology to the
[SPEAKER_04]: service of their own experimentation
without telling them what to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: how to do it, and what topic to
experiment, but just providing that
[SPEAKER_04]: service.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here in this presentation,
that's what I will explain, try to show
[SPEAKER_04]: you what we're trying to do today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to start here with a quote from the
book, The Fifth Discipline, from Peter St.
[SPEAKER_04]: James.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of a longer text,
but from a very young age, we are taught
[SPEAKER_04]: to break apart problems to fragment the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: This apparently makes complex tasks and
subjects more manageable, but we pay an
[SPEAKER_04]: enormous price.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea here is that if I have a research
topic that I take and I isolate that very
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, after that, when I try to put it
together in the big picture, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to put together a broken mirror.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never going to look exactly like the
entire thing, see?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea here is we try to see,
could we bring everything together into a
[SPEAKER_04]: learning organization?
[SPEAKER_04]: And another little piece here before I
start about the farmers that I have is
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a push here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the bottom here of the folder.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 organizations are calling for a food
systems approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically, again, trying to sit down,
isolate things, but try to see what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens if you think of it as a system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going after or working directly with
farmers, think about it, when you
[SPEAKER_04]: experiment something, it's something that
will lead towards the vision that you have
[SPEAKER_04]: for your farm, or something that makes
sense this year with your equipment,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is resources that you have,
your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically what you try is an
integration of all your system,
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than if I arrive, develop something
and I try to sell it to you, then there's
[SPEAKER_04]: just one chance out of many chance that it
will fit in your operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we start thinking system,
what I'm trying to do here is to merge
[SPEAKER_04]: several disciplines.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is obviously agronomy,
because we're looking for consistent
[SPEAKER_04]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to understand how things work to
know what we are observing and
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is now data science that we can
use, because everything that happens
[SPEAKER_04]: generates a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we are able to capture that data,
now in our conversation and exchange when
[SPEAKER_04]: we discuss, we have that data to increase
the certainty of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_04]: the outcomes, and what we observe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after that, there is social
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea here is to make sure that we have
an effective process, because if we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: considering the system as a whole,
considering the humans that we are all,
[SPEAKER_04]: the process can be disconnected from
reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the center of this is on farm
experimentation, which is the topic that
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on in the farmers' data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so why we decided to focus on farm
experimentation, systems approach,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're working with data from the
real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are asking farmers to change
towards sustainable agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is how change happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: You experiment with things here and there,
and slowly you progress towards your
[SPEAKER_04]: vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so to support on farm
experimentation, what we are trying to do
[SPEAKER_04]: is to say, okay, let's bring expertise
skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have students in the lab that
have skills and time to work on the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we work with agronomists to be able
to reach you where you are on the
[SPEAKER_04]: territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have researchers.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, last year we did a project
on biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a soil microbiologist,
but at Cornell I have access to all the
[SPEAKER_04]: best scientists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I connected with soil microbiologists,
and they taught us how to collect the
[SPEAKER_04]: data, how to transport it, how to process
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when we get the numbers,
how to interpret it, you see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a process that is expert
enabled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have access to those experts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, I was talking about
rationale.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have all those tools now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have tools on the web that allows us to
communicate easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have a little bit of funding
coming from projects here and there that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can put to the service of your
experimentations.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, we have a bunch of biomass
samples, soil samples, and then we have
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a drone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have things that we can provide and
just fly in your field and learn more from
[SPEAKER_04]: the experimentation that you are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: With this, we are hoping that it will help
you get validations.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're trying something, you want to
see if it works, then it will kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: increase the certainty of your
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if we all work together and we live
that data, then we can start learning from
[SPEAKER_04]: each other and something that works on a
farm that may not have spread as fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all of a sudden we can share those
innovations and find things that are
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in the real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not necessarily just in labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically here what I'm trying to say is
that as scientists, we don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: monopoly of innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very good at quantifying stuff,
but I'm not better than you to invent
[SPEAKER_04]: something new, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, we're hoping that this
way we can accelerate change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we capture and we increase the
learning potential of everything that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing on your farm, then we learn
faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we progress faster, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the idea here is to try to say,
can we scale the speed and the learning
[SPEAKER_04]: process rather than finding a solution and
try to scale that solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: See, so what we are after is really the
way you learn and the way you progress
[SPEAKER_04]: towards your vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so in the next few slides,
I will show you what you're doing to go
[SPEAKER_04]: towards building that farmers data.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing we did is just get our,
we just went and selected the topic that a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of farmers were experimenting with and
then just went with it and worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this campaign here, we covered 24
sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were trying to do two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing was, are we able to get a
conclusion for each site and each year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, if as a scientist, this is,
I've never been after something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would do is that I would repeat it
in two, three sites over two, three years,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then get the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here, if I want to create value for
the farmers, I don't ask you to repeat
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever you do for three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to come to some
interpretation within one year,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I know that you guys, how you work
is that whatever you learn this year,
[SPEAKER_04]: you use it to iterate for the following
year and you iterate like this until it
[SPEAKER_04]: works and not necessarily repeating the
same thing over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a little bit of adaptation from
my side to be able to meet your
[SPEAKER_04]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first thing we're trying to do,
to try to conclude in one year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to do this, we consult with farmers,
with people in the network and with
[SPEAKER_04]: experts to identify, to better learn the
process of what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we are not using a replicated
control trial, like we do on a research
[SPEAKER_04]: farm, then we need to rely on something
else to increase the certainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this is, is a agronomic logic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can call it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea here is to say, if I do this,
I expect to have more yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we need to kind of backtrack and
think, okay, what would make this generate
[SPEAKER_04]: more yield?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this project here, I told you it was
on biologicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we said, okay, you put those bacteria
in the soil, then there will be something
[SPEAKER_04]: in between before you get to see more
yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, will it survive?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went and collected samples to see if
the organisms lived in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it didn't live, that means that it was
obviously not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it lives, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: First step, we pass the first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we went and measured the change in
nitrogen status of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we didn't see any difference,
like maybe it didn't do much.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it did, then after that, it's worth
looking at, yes, then it translated into
[SPEAKER_04]: yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now you see, instead of relying on an
experimental design to draw our
[SPEAKER_04]: conclusions, we do a little bit of a more
detective approach, trying to put the
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of the puzzle together until we get
a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the first thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing, and I'm not going into
this, but when we are working as a network
[SPEAKER_04]: and we get data from all those farms,
all of a sudden we can start seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: patterns and things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for instance here, my student did an
analysis using AI that allows him to
[SPEAKER_04]: identify farms where it worked,
farm where it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you look at all the data collected
for each farm and then see what was the
[SPEAKER_04]: driver for the farms where it worked or
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we start quickly understanding what
are the drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that allows to inform for following
iteration of your experimentation,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe what are the success factors or the
factors that could decrease your chances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then after that, we are working on
tools to make it easier for the first
[SPEAKER_04]: iteration, everything was on paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to go back and forth trying to
understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we start talking about rotations
and trying to record all the rotations
[SPEAKER_04]: from all those 24 sites, that was really a
mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're trying to build tools that
will make the exchange a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, this is an experiment card and
that kind of takes you towards the path of
[SPEAKER_04]: taking your experiment to the scientific
process so we believe that this would be
[SPEAKER_04]: your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then to verify that we will, that will be
like, what will you do in your field?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like side by side, I will change nitrogen
rate, or I will put a biological,
[SPEAKER_04]: I will do this, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, and measure, what will
you measure?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the metric that you use to
interpret your result?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are right if that's for you to
start thinking when I get those numbers,
[SPEAKER_04]: how will I interpret it to see if it
worked or it didn't work?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will kind of help you draw on
your experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once we have access to this,
so we have an online form that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: fill, once we see this, then that's kind
of the start of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can ask you, will you need biomass
samples, soil sample?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you need to have a contract
applicator, contract deal mapping and
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we can engage.
[SPEAKER_04]: After that, we're working on different
ways to find ways to, when we have all
[SPEAKER_04]: that information, to allow you to have
access to your data as well and to
[SPEAKER_04]: interact with your experimentation a
little bit more easier than if it's on
[SPEAKER_04]: several different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just bringing everything together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then we are working on a survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of you may see this, it's going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to see what is the state of our
farm experimentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is one survey that exists that was
run in Australia on this, and 90% of
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers are experimenting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I would think that it should
be about the same here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then after that, we're developing the
farmers data lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there, the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here, we are just bringing all
resources, have a little bit of material
[SPEAKER_04]: for you to learn, but also to engage with
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that becomes like a platform where we
can communicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am also working on the global farm
experimentation network because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: community around the world in Australia,
UK, South America, France that are engaged
[SPEAKER_04]: in this process and working on developing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are creating like a network of who
is doing what, where to learn from each
[SPEAKER_04]: other basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the last slide here is just to
inform you that we have a new project that
[SPEAKER_04]: is funded by the New York Corn and Soybean
Association, Growth Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is for adjusting nitrogen rates in
corn after cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are experimenting with nitrogen
rates in corn after cover crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would qualify you to work with us on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, we've got some funding and
we make all that funding available just to
[SPEAKER_04]: support your experimentation in terms of
we will visit your field, collect samples,
[SPEAKER_04]: process samples, and organize all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to talk to you about the
farmers data lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a booth at the back there if you
want to grab a card or discuss it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
