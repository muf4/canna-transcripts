[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I asked to give some talk about
machine learning in digital agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the difference between human and
machine?
[SPEAKER_04]: So human learns from experience and
machine need to be told what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it possible we can can you get
machine learned from experience?
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is precisely machine learning is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the experience of machine is called the
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's possible to solve some problem or
predict something by a machine when you
[SPEAKER_04]: change the machine with large number of
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with sophisticated statistical
predictive models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So perfect example is now is self driving
car identification is spam mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you speak recognition, effective web
source and understanding the human genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, the growth of agriculture has
visited agriculture related fields,
[SPEAKER_04]: generate vast amount of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is give us opportunity to apply
predictive model.
[SPEAKER_04]: To solve some problem in related to the
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this field is mostly promising in field
of remote sensing with proximal data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the fertilizer recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a large amount of data,
you can generate for field experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And digital soil measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I going to give some of the
finding what I did when I was in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: See me to in Bangladesh with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also at the work, some of the work I
did with join us with data, soil carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first study, we developed a special
predictive model of Mase fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using a single machine learning is called
the random forest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another, I use the data set from
Western USA soil carbon data to develop a
[SPEAKER_04]: matter symbol learning model for a special
interpolation of soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the study.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of people involved this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So two international organization,
three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: They meet PD, IPNS, and two national
in-store involved this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why are you doing this study?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mase is the second crop in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mostly growing for livestock, poultry,
and fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, a lot of farmers apply
unbalanced fertilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So mostly they apply to more nitrogen,
less potassium, and K and other
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So innovative approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such as site-specific nutrient management
with integrate field-specific decision on
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient requirement based on indigenous
nutrient supply capacity, recovery,
[SPEAKER_04]: IPNC applied land, and attenable yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over time, SNM approach evolved into
simplified form of estimate fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: requirement based on attenable yield and
yield response using omission soil trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently, SNM integration into decision
support system, they recently two tools
[SPEAKER_04]: developed by, one is called NITEN expert,
International Plant NITEN Institute,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other NITEN manager, International
Rice Institute, to recommend fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: for Southeast Asia for maize and rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we found that these two tools are
perfectly welled when control experiment
[SPEAKER_04]: were done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But scale-up issue, there is no farmer is
adopting this tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are trying to explore why.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we set up an experiment in Bangladesh
with fertilizer recommendation with this
[SPEAKER_04]: tool, and also we monitor the farmer's
field and farmer's management practice
[SPEAKER_04]: around the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we have another treatment with
BRC, National Recommendation Fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found that most of the cases this tool
have some yield advantage over fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer's practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you compare to the National
Recommendation, only few farmers get
[SPEAKER_04]: higher yield with this experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try to explore all of the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we found that lower yield associated
two tools are associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: site characterization, they wrongly site
characterized, and also set the target
[SPEAKER_04]: yield, low target yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: The low target yield leads to low
fertilizer recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: In most cases, we found that this tool
recommend lower fertilizer recommendation
[SPEAKER_04]: than National Recommendation, both in low
and high yield target.
[SPEAKER_04]: So about 40 percent, 40 to 20 percent
farmers, 20 percent cases, yield target is
[SPEAKER_04]: lower than existing farmer's yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while this is the, this S&M approach,
site experience is very sound technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are also likely be difficult to
scale up, and especially when the large
[SPEAKER_04]: number of emerging farmers is Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moreover, identification of the factor
that regulate the indigenous soil supply
[SPEAKER_04]: capacity, this is the first requirement of
fertilizer recommendation, remain
[SPEAKER_04]: important goal to identify the most
appropriate, especially feasible unit,
[SPEAKER_04]: and develop a special decision support
system for developing customized nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: management recommendation, farmers on the
larger scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we developed use the data, we try to
predict, especially maize yield without
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers, and with optimum fertilizer,
also agronomic nutrient efficiency,
[SPEAKER_04]: and using the random forest regression
model, and assemble the tree-based machine
[SPEAKER_04]: learning model, and using the data,
large amount of data, nutrient coefficient
[SPEAKER_04]: for trial, legacy soil nutrient data,
this is the only source data we have
[SPEAKER_04]: available in Bangladesh, legacy soil map
data, and also use your Landsat images to
[SPEAKER_04]: characterize the area, which was the
potential maize area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the experimental site of 324
across the Bangladesh, this from 2011 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a five-triple in there,
totally LPK jet is optimum condition,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we sequentially reduce nitrogen P,
and K, and zinc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the legacy data set uses the huge
amount of data used, especially 60,000
[SPEAKER_04]: data point in use.
[SPEAKER_04]: This data was collected from 1985 to 1995
by SRDI, BARI, BD, and BU in Bina.
[SPEAKER_04]: So use about 50,000 topsoil after cleaning
up the data, and we applied the
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-dustion prigging, that is called
normal scope transform data, and predicted
[SPEAKER_04]: the nutrient of all the soil element.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the map of all the soil nutrient
element,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also the legacy soil maps is developed
by UNDB FAU in soil environmental report
[SPEAKER_04]: in 1998.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is agroecological zone, extreme
temperature zone, drought, dry season
[SPEAKER_04]: drought zone, soil moisture rain capacity,
general soil types, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: After reclassification of map,
we converted 200-dustion data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And NOPT site, 320, we have characterized
accordingly the soil data and this
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we identified the maize area.
[SPEAKER_04]: The maize area is not exactly the maize
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very difficult to find out the maize
area in Bangladesh using the landscape
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just find a potential maize growing
area, that is when highland Robi area,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's mean highland dry season crop area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's potentially growing for the maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the analytical approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we first split the data in training and
validation data sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we applied the feature selection
approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we applied two methods here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is information gain and the recursive
feature limiting with cause validation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we applied the training process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So use random forest and train the model
for the maize field with optimum
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maize field with NPK and also the
economic efficiency of applied NPK chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we validate with our independent
data set, how the efficiency are to
[SPEAKER_04]: validate the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we predict this variable in
prediction grid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used several art practices in carrot,
mostly the carrot with random forest and
[SPEAKER_04]: random forest, SRC, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first type, we give example
how to choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feature selection, minus N, yield without
N.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the recursive, we can find this is
the, this method only selected the extreme
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, zone, soil, P, soil calcium,
P and nitrogen sulfurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the information gain approach selected
about eight variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to use the common variable in
the both method to train our model.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first eight variable
importance variable for all the,
[SPEAKER_04]: for optimum yield and under minus NPK and
all the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the cause validation result.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we validate interval data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: Model predicted not go well about 35 to 45
percent, 44 percent in cause validation
[SPEAKER_04]: result.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly in the, with validation data
set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get the very poor efficiency in the
maize prediction in zinc use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_04]: only 12 percent with validation data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: And highest we get the yield in minus K
plot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get about 58 with cause validation
result and also with attaining that
[SPEAKER_04]: testing data set about 51 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we predict this model with our
prediction grid.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the map of minus yield,
minus P, minus K, minus zinc.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see those all over the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the lower yield without minus N.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this yield is very much low we get in
the south coastal part, Riksporn area in
[SPEAKER_04]: Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And favorable environment where the maize
are expanding very rapidly, this area will
[SPEAKER_04]: get little bit higher yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, may not be due to the soil
variable, it is the favorable environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's slightly amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we similarly get the highest yield in
minus, better yield in northern part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the country, the same area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also the zinc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the agronomic efficiency map,
Kg per Kg.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get the similar pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: In northern part of the country compared
to other part country nitrogen efficiency
[SPEAKER_04]: is a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And P efficiency mostly low here in the
calcareous low pH area calcareous belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get the very low pH potassium
efficiency here in barring tract.
[SPEAKER_04]: The elevated area is a very drought-prone
area and also very little in northern part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And zinc efficiency we get the very
abnormal high yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get high efficiency all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we calculate how much nutrient
requirement in the maize-grained area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we found that most of the northern part
of the country, we need little bit higher
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen to get the optimum yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also we get the, in potassium,
for phosphorus, we get about 20 to 30 Kg K
[SPEAKER_04]: we need this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get the very high K remodeling
coastal area and central part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And potassium, we need a very more than
160 Kg potassium in northwestern part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we calculate the area,
we found about the 124% area, they need
[SPEAKER_04]: 150 Kg yen, that is national
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for phosphorus, we found 70% area.
[SPEAKER_04]: For potassium, we actually get very higher
area, we need to apply more potassium in
[SPEAKER_04]: Bangladesh, some of the most area.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are mostly concentrated in
southwestern part, western northwestern
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: For zinc, we need our predicted model to
show that the zinc we need little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The recommendation, this is 8 Kg.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 4 to 6 Kg enough to get the
optimum yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we do just some simple economic
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the yield of the, under our
current condition, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the northern part, less
stress-pound area, maize yield
[SPEAKER_04]: comparatively higher, and also gross
return also higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you calculate how much fertilizer
cost, and use this map to calculate the
[SPEAKER_04]: net return, if the net return is still
higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: This over only the fertilizer,
we are not considering any other factor
[SPEAKER_04]: that irrigation cost, weeding cost,
and others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we evaluate the efficacy of machine
learning, for predictive nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: requirement and agronomic efficiency,
but model explained only 32, 50%
[SPEAKER_04]: variability may be, and 12 to 40%
variability make agronomic nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: This low predictive part of the model is
probably due to the uncertainty of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: the special data use this analysis,
because all of the soil data is developed
[SPEAKER_04]: long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the map where they created by FAO,
there is a lot of a special uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the NOPT experiments are used,
the data from it is not especially
[SPEAKER_04]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because experiments are not set up for,
actually for this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is some cluster, it's not fully
captured, the variability maize growing
[SPEAKER_04]: condition in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, model needs to be trained with new
data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you develop new data set,
especially balanced experiment,
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can develop the special decision
support system for border and
[SPEAKER_04]: region-specific recommendation law to
reach large number of farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are doing, one experiment in
Bangladesh now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we selected one maize growing area.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 300 fields, we are doing NOPT
experiments, and we are generating data,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the soil data, map data using
remote sensing to try to test our
[SPEAKER_04]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it possible to develop, especially DCM,
our decision support system for Bangladesh
[SPEAKER_04]: and North.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we are doing same kind of
experiment, five countries in our,
[SPEAKER_04]: CIMIT is doing, I am not anymore in CIMIT.
[SPEAKER_04]: CIMIT is being same experiment,
five countries in Africa, Nepal,
[SPEAKER_04]: and India with similar approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are planning to use this model that
analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I am also helping them to organize all
of the model and others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, another study I did with, to try to
see if we assemble multiple model,
[SPEAKER_04]: if we get a better prediction power or
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this study is collaborative studies in
Cornell, I get the data from Johannes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also the CISO, and they are involved
in this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what is an assemble machine learning?
[SPEAKER_04]: This means this is, you have to assembling
multiple model with similar
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics or different
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is three common approach there on
bagging.
[SPEAKER_04]: The multiple similar model with high
variance.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are average to decrease the
variance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most perfect example is a random forest
and back tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is boosting, build a multiple
increment model to decrease the bias while
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping the variance small.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the gradient boosting or extreme
gradient boosting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the stacking is totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stacking, we combine multiple layer
machine learning, we call the sub models.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the stacking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, each model predict, prediction is done
for each model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then use a new model, is the model level
one, which learn from this model and make
[SPEAKER_04]: final prediction, end up which is better
than any individual model.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be sometime not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we get the loss prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If models are correlated each other,
then we get the loss prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the stacking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this study, I used eight machine
learning model on this simple linear,
[SPEAKER_04]: generalized linear regression and
tree-based assemble, bagging method,
[SPEAKER_04]: random forest, support vector machine with
kernel-based regression and cube-based.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very new model.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the rule-based model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is extreme gradient boosting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And generalized linear model with
penalized maximum likelihood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is a bison-based model.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bison-based additive regression
tree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another is a multivariate adaptive
regression spline.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is the data I get from USG.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get from about 475 surface soil samples
from Colorado, Kansas, Mexico,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_04]: These samples are collected from United
State Geological Survey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more or less, it was predicted using
the mid-infrared scopography and partial
[SPEAKER_04]: least square regression was done to
develop predicted model by Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we then validate totally independent
data sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: These same samples are analyzed by USGS
lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use several environmental
variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Among the 10 variables, elevation,
slope, gradient, slope, length,
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect, vertical curvature, horizontal
curvature, topography for position index,
[SPEAKER_04]: slope position, and climate data.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use the mean annual air temperature,
mean annual precipitation, bioregium
[SPEAKER_04]: group, NVDI, National Land Co-operative,
and some soil data we get from STAGO soil
[SPEAKER_04]: data, K-factor, and silt and clay.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the overall methodologies for to
develop the special interpolation map.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is almost similar to the
traditional regression tree, but we use
[SPEAKER_04]: the eight machine learning model and start
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, we transform the data with a log
transformation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then split the data to data set
training and validate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we change the model with eight model,
the training data set, and the predictive
[SPEAKER_04]: model.
[SPEAKER_04]: We then start the residual, use the simple
keying to the residual map, and then we
[SPEAKER_04]: use the model to develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use the treatment, and then finally
add it up together and develop the final
[SPEAKER_04]: predictive map.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly, we validate the data,
independent data, testing data set with
[SPEAKER_04]: the same approach we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the, when we validate the MRI
predicted soil carbon with measured soil
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon, we get very good prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this analysis done totally
separate laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is done in Australia predictive model,
another USGS.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we get little bit under estimate value
in your MRI predicted, but overall
[SPEAKER_04]: prediction is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the special data.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, with the similar approach I mentioned
for my Mays-Hill prediction, we use the
[SPEAKER_04]: two feature selection methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is unapproved, and another is one is
we selected first four variable from here,
[SPEAKER_04]: and for similar eight, nine variable from
information gain, finally we get the nine
[SPEAKER_04]: variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the map of this nine variable used
for training the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is overall the K4
cross-validation statistics when we
[SPEAKER_04]: training the model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we found that overall among the eight
model, random forest, a Mars and bison
[SPEAKER_04]: additive regression get performed little
bit better than other model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also this model explain more
variability soil or current carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: When stacking these eight model together,
we get the, we get very low RMSE,
[SPEAKER_04]: RMSE is less than 0.2 in log scale,
and model explain about 72% variability of
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, then we extract the residual all of
the model and do the variable analysis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and use this and do the simple cleaning,
and predict it with validation data set,
[SPEAKER_04]: and check what is the model efficiency
when you compare the validation data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, using the validation data set,
we get the similar kind of results.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we assemble the model, we get,
we can explain the, this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-special mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not added the residual,
and this is the special mean we have added
[SPEAKER_04]: the residuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: We detected through the validation data
point, we get the little bit better when
[SPEAKER_04]: we added the residual at the 0.72%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get the very, when you compare the
traditional ordinary cleaning,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can get about 20% improvement,
that is we get the 20% lower error when
[SPEAKER_04]: you assemble the model, and overall we get
the 20 to 70% lower error when you use the
[SPEAKER_04]: special assemble model, meta-assemble
model.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we get very little improvement over
random forest recreation cleaning,
[SPEAKER_04]: about 2.3 or 5% or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, then we create a prediction model.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added up the residual map and all of
the predicted maps together.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the final map.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get the almost, this is the
meta-assemble map.
[SPEAKER_04]: The meta-assemble map almost similar to
the random forest and BART map,
[SPEAKER_04]: but other three maps underestimate the
actual value.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's less than 20%, we get the almost
similar to the actual statistics of the
[SPEAKER_04]: data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this map also explained the local
variability of the soil organic carbon due
[SPEAKER_04]: to the influence of environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we successfully assembled eight
machine learning model and combination of
[SPEAKER_04]: the geostatistics to map soil organic
large area in the western USM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this model is a better, show the
better performance than ordinary cleaning
[SPEAKER_04]: as well cleaning with other base learner
models or sub-models.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, model also complement with other
environmental information, that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: making the special in terms of soil
organic carbon more efficient than useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_04]: I may be too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, in your MACE project,
I might have missed it or would just need
[SPEAKER_00]: you to help me spell it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one data product that you could
fund to improve what would it be to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it significantly better your predictions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any soil properties or what would you like
donors to improve so that your predictions
[SPEAKER_00]: get significantly better?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it most sensitive to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most sensitive is, of course, the soil
variable, some of the soil variable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, we have to incorporate some of
the management decision of farmers,
[SPEAKER_04]: what kind of fertilizer farmers applied in
the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this year, last year, we did,
I told before that we are conducting a
[SPEAKER_04]: large number of farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are collecting all of the information
of farmers' management history,
[SPEAKER_04]: how much fertilizer they are applying to
this field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, the how did they grow previous
rice crop, how they manage the rice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there is maybe some residual effect of
fertilizer when they applied to the rice
[SPEAKER_04]: and they have some in the MACE crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: In two decision support system,
the Newton expert, Newton manager,
[SPEAKER_04]: they need this kind of input for setting
the target yield goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the time, you see that when
you ask the farmers, there is a large
[SPEAKER_04]: possibility that they get the wrong
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Farmers don't know the reply.
[SPEAKER_04]: They give some of the numbers,
some of the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are trying to develop a special
explicit database.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are using the, we use the SAR MACE,
especially the RR MACE to predict rice
[SPEAKER_04]: yield in the same field.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we have a 300 MACE field and we
predict the rice yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, no need to ask the farmers how much,
how did we get the rice yield last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we get the data from our data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think this kind of data may be
important to get the better prediction
[SPEAKER_04]: models to incorporate all of the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, beside the soil data and other soil
map data, we need to know the how much
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers is applied, what is the manage
effect is existing with some reason,
[SPEAKER_04]: how is it vary to reason to reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can go to the precisely Newton
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not precisely, because we cannot reach in
every farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's impossible for farming like in
Bangladesh, small scale farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we try to develop a landscape base or
something block-based fertilizer
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, our plan was that we do a special
decision support system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ask the farmer, where are you from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have all of the special database.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will generate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you extract all of the information
from this database, and maybe we ask the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmer, how much you want, and we get the
fertilizer recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be done by the dealer who sell the
seed, who sell the fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of them will be done by the paper
base, no computer base or something fancy
[SPEAKER_04]: mobile base.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks sound, but it's not, maybe not,
it will be takes time to work in our
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you see, I see in my
experiment, when I see the farmers asking
[SPEAKER_04]: from the tap-based hardware, farmers try
to be smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to give some more answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes these answers are not correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are trying to avoid the
sub-complication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, that was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of questions about the soil
carbon mapping area.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is just a clarification, which is
related to the calibration and the
[SPEAKER_02]: validation set.
[SPEAKER_02]: You looked on the map there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of your data is from the calibration
set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, are you confident that you can disable
the nitrogen model when you check against
[SPEAKER_02]: the validation set?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like the validation set was very
tiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually we selected 20% data for
validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And calibration was 50%?
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other side was, a number of other people
are doing similar things, like the solar
[SPEAKER_02]: grids project, for example, global scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you comment a little bit on how yours
relates to these other efforts?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just read a couple of publications
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Global Soil Information System.
[SPEAKER_04]: They published recently one paper,
global mapping using assemble two model.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay, but they did some only the
cross-validation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have no validation data set and
training data set.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not exploring what is the
relationship with the carbon and the
[SPEAKER_04]: predictor they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have no actually any approach,
because this is a very dangerous thing in
[SPEAKER_04]: machine learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes machine learning is
overpredicted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you are not carefully select your
predictor, most of the time we'll get the
[SPEAKER_04]: overestimated prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, these two papers recently published,
they have not done these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They used a large number of millions of
data points and predicted carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: These things have happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: This kind of global mapping of the land
use and other things done by different
[SPEAKER_04]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when you carefully check for the
third-order country in Africa and Asia,
[SPEAKER_04]: we get a surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the analysis is wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they have no training data set,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just they get the data and do the global
soil things and global mapping,
[SPEAKER_04]: and most of the time they are wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we checked this data for Bangladesh
and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found this data.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big Walmart parking lot, they classify
as a mazeland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And similarly in the Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they published the data in a good
journal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a lot of uncertainty that people
are doing without knowing the landscape,
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing the nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question kind of similar to
Yahan's.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could pick any three soil variables
and have high-resolution maps for your
[SPEAKER_03]: mazeland, what variables would they be and
why in this Bangladesh system?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what's really constraining?
[SPEAKER_04]: We select the obvious soil carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And soil for Bangladesh context is
potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because potassium now depletion is
alarming in Bangladesh due to the waste
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of potassium is mining from the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another may be the pH important,
but the soil pH, soil pH, but greatly
[SPEAKER_04]: related to the soil pH, sometimes farmers'
management practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when farmers apply, there's a
residual of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to get the available pH to
develop predictive model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the time we get the wrong answer
at the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's better to the stable nutrient.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a very little influence by soil
chemistry and influenced by the management
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the mining for soil potassium
also might be good for the soil textures.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some influence of soil or nutrient
availability or nutrient depletion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question about the yield
prediction.
So, maybe I could get an instant,
but how do you incorporate in the model
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use different crop varieties?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a very nice question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually all of the variety we use
here is two types, mostly hybrid maize.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we don't know is that a variety is
responsible or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this experiment we did in Bangladesh,
we supplied the seed to the farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is uncertainty due to the variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this experiment we supplied with the
similar type of maize variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are doing the same experiment with
400 farmers with similar, same maize
[SPEAKER_04]: variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's just you know the last times we
get some of the uncertainty due to the
[SPEAKER_04]: variety and showing times and other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to use the one window of showing
the 15 days windows of showing times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult to do this kind of
experiment in the farmers field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can you include, for example,
as a variable the crop variety?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we did some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the ranking that you get,
you can see how much is the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop variety compared, for example,
to soil features.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you can see maybe how much you can
improve your prediction having the data
[SPEAKER_01]: from the crop variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that it's going to play a
substantial role in the value of
[SPEAKER_01]: prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we can try these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the hybrid variety,
those are in growing in the Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the similar types of yield
potentiality in Bangladesh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they are used mostly fine yard and
monsanto variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: They yield potential almost similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I maybe try to run them a model with
the variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see how it's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: For questions, please.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
