[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my talk today is on the fossil record
and evolution of water ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be talking about work
that I've done on Patagonian fossils and
[SPEAKER_01]: North American fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see some European fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all parts of the world, just a little
bit about myself first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of institutions and
people who have made this work possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: collectors, fossil collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jennifer Spitko, who some of you might
know, has been working in Alejandra's lab
[SPEAKER_01]: and has helped with some of the imaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I especially want to highlight my
collaborators on the projects I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: showing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are my co-authors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Alejandra Gandolfo, of course,
has been my longtime collaborator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a postdoc in her lab years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Argentina, Ruben Cunil, Mari Zamoloa,
and Osofokundo de Benedetti have been
[SPEAKER_01]: working on these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Nathan Judd, who was also a
former postdoc in Alejandra's lab and is
[SPEAKER_01]: now a professor, I believe, at William
Jules College in Missouri, was also a
[SPEAKER_01]: co-author on one of these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit about where I'm coming
from and what I'm doing at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at the Paleontological Research
Institution, which is located across the
[SPEAKER_01]: lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It runs the Museum of the Earth and the
Cayuga Nature Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my job is involved in outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also do research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of research, I've been working
on the Gray Fossil Site from Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fossil site is about 4.5 to 4.9
million years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were here a few years ago,
I gave a talk on that fossil site,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a fruit and seed flora.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do a lot of outreach projects,
especially on the web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved in digital encyclopedia
of ancient life, writing about
[SPEAKER_01]: embryophytes, putting together the
regional guides of Earth science in here
[SPEAKER_01]: on Earth, and also working on a website on
grasses for the evolution part of Earth at
[SPEAKER_01]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here at Cornell, I've primarily been
working on Patagonian paleoflora.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I was a postdoc in
Alejandra's lab a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I got my start on this
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done field work in Patagonia a number
of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: This photo, and this photo is from our
recent trip, which was in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also worked on a number of studies on
these floras, primarily Laguna del Lunco,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Eocene, and some Cretaceous
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I worked on this paper that
Teddy Mattel was also on.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an undergrad in Alejandra's lab,
and he's now at the University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're continuing to work on a report
on fossil plants from the national parks
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sponsored by the Paleontological
Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now with her, I'm working on
this on the Dixoniasi, so fossils from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cretaceous of Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also working with the Cornell
University Paleobotanical Collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one goal for this collection is to try
to enhance its curation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The collection is right now held in
Emerson Hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of fossil cabinets and
drawers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to get this packed and
organized and get new cabinets for the
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I begin, talking about the
fossils, I think a lot of people here
[SPEAKER_01]: probably are not paleontologists and don't
deal with the geological time scale a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be talking about a lot of
geological time periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The geological time scale is a relative
time scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Phanerozoic is the eon in which most
of the fossil record occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the complex macrophossils we
think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be talking today primarily about
fossils from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're younger than 252 million years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mesozoic era is the time of the
dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ends at 66 million years ago with an
asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is known as the end Cretaceous
extinction, the Cretaceous-Paleogene
[SPEAKER_01]: boundary, or in older literature,
the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we have the Cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is when we have the rise of
mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the flora starts to look a lot more
modern.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will also show some fossils from the
Cenozoic era as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't memorized this whole time
scale, I've tried to put in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: numerical ages to help everybody stay
oriented in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water ferns, what are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern water ferns or extant water ferns
are in the order Selvin Ailes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lector sprangiate ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most diverse group of living
ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are heterosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll return to that in a moment,
but basically they're producing two
[SPEAKER_01]: different sizes of spores, large
megaspores, smaller microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern Selvin Ailes are divided into two
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these is the Marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the water clover family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsiliaceae has three living genera,
Pileolaria, Regnalidium, and Marsilia.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants have rhizomes and they're
rooted in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other family is Selvin Ailes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern Selvin Ailes and Marsiliaceae
consist of two genera of floating aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the characteristics of these
ferns, I've already mentioned their growth
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, compared to what we might
think of as a typical or stereotypical
[SPEAKER_01]: fern leaf, they have relatively simplified
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think of this stereotypical fern
leaf as a large pinnately compound leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: in these groups, the leaves can be simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have two leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four leaflets, or in the case of
Pileolaria way over here, there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: leaflets and the leaves just look like
these little stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferns are heterosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most modern ferns are homosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in heterosperous ferns, they produce
two different types of spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The megaspores give rise to the
megagametophytes, which produce the eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microspores are smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give rise to the micro gametophytes,
which produce the spur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Megaspores are produced in capsules called
megasporangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each megasporangium produces only one
megaspore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's monomegaspori in these ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microsporangia are the capsules that
produce the microspores, and each
[SPEAKER_01]: microsporangium produces more than one
microspore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sori, or the groups of sporangia,
can be either heterosporangiate and
[SPEAKER_01]: marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: This means they're producing both
megaspores and microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they can be homosporangiate and
salvinaceae, which means they're only
[SPEAKER_01]: producing megaspores or they're only
producing microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will come up later.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can the fossil record tell us
about these ferns?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it tell us in general,
and what does it tell us about these ferns
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fossil record is physical evidence of
past life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually shows us the physical
structures of ancient plants that are now
[SPEAKER_01]: extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the only direct evidence we
have for these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we can make inferences about
character evolution for things like
[SPEAKER_01]: through methods like phylogenetic
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fossil record is kind of a reality
check on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was really going on in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fossil record of water ferns,
plausibly, there are some older records,
[SPEAKER_01]: starts near the Jurassic-Cretaceous
boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is about 145 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The record largely consists of spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been especially an emphasis on
megaspores, the megaspore record in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mesozoic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only important for understanding
the evolution of these ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things can be important
biostratigraphically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at the ages of
sediments, the environments, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do these fossils tell us?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tell us about characters that are
no longer present in the modern ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones I have highlighted in yellow
are things I'm going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that aren't are some things that
I'm not really going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't projects that I've worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have examples of them over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing the fossil record can tell us
is that some of these plants may have had
[SPEAKER_01]: more complex leaves in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an example of this is hydropteridium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fossil over here, you can see the
plant reconstructed here with these more
[SPEAKER_01]: complex leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the Lake Cretaceous of
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also tell us about some
structures that are no longer present in
[SPEAKER_01]: modern genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one example of this is floats on
Salvinia sporophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also many floated Azolla megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heterosbrangia sorii and Salviniasi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these examples I'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that some of these ancient ferns may
have produced more than one megascore per
[SPEAKER_01]: megasprangium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's based on a study that Benedetti
et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: did in 2020, reinterpreting these spores
and sporangia of Paleoazolla patagonica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see this megasprangium here
very clearly with two megaspores in this
[SPEAKER_01]: fossil form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant that produced these spores
is unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't know what the sporophyte
looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fossil record can also tell us about
the sequence of evolution of characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about that a little bit when
I get into Marsileaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm starting with Marsileaceae,
the water clover family.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned before, this family has
three extant genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that distinguishes the extant
genera is the leaf type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marsileae has the most complex leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have four leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like little clovers,
hence the name water clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ragnolidium has two leaflets per leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pileolaria has no leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, they just look like stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is sort of an idealized version
of what one of these plants would look
[SPEAKER_01]: like with the rhizome, the roots,
the leaves, and then these little round
[SPEAKER_01]: structures or bean-like structures or
sporocarps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a look at the sporocarps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sporocarps in Marsileaceae are
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are probably some sort of
modification of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in the center, sporocarps on a
living plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the upper left and upper right are
longitudinal sections, a fresh section and
[SPEAKER_01]: a fixed section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down here is a detail of the sporocarp
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of the sporocarps has multiple
sori.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sori are these odd long areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the sori are the sprangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these sori are mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce both megaspores and
microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sporocarp walls are thick and
sclerified.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a section.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, the sclerenchyma hasn't
really developed the thick walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there would be multiple layers of
sclerids here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the sporocarps open,
they release this gelatinous kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: structure to which these sori are
attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these break down and release the
spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other important thing to note about
Marsileaceae is it's not just the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that distinguish the genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with a particular emphasis here on the
megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the megaspores of the three
genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice Pileolaria and Regnalidium
have these appendages at the tips of the
[SPEAKER_01]: megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called acrolamellae.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're lobed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of Regnalidium, they're also
sort of twisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in Marsileaceae, the acrolamella
has actually been reduced to just a rim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spores with these acrolamellae can be
found in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the modern forms, there's also a
gelatinous layer involved in the formation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the acrolamella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all involved in fertilization
of the megagametophyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fossil spore record is really
important in this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some examples of mesozoic spore
types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are extinct spore types.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the spore record goes back to about the
Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 145 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mesozoic megaspore types are
Arsileides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really spectacular looking spore
is an example of Arsileides.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of different species of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant that produced these spores is
unidentified.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has not been found.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's assumed to be related to Marsileaceae
because of this really spectacular
[SPEAKER_01]: appendage at the tip, which looks sort of
like the modern ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other megaspore type is Mellospora.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the acrolamella very nicely
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mellospora looks very much like the spores
of modern, excuse me, of modern
[SPEAKER_01]: regnolidium, particularly Mellospora
lobata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some other species of Mellospora have
different ornamentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crybellus sporaeides down here is one of
these, which is somewhat regnolidium-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that's usually associated
with the group is Gabanosporas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the mesozoic these
spore types are replaced by spores that
[SPEAKER_01]: are placed in the modern genera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marsilea, Pileolaria, and regnolidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2013, Collinson et al said that
these mesozoic spore types probably really
[SPEAKER_01]: go extinct because there have been some
records of the mesozoic spore types
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing into the Cenozoic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sporaeides are what I'm mostly
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work on plant macrophossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sporaeide record of this group goes
back again about to the Jurassic
[SPEAKER_01]: Fretaceous boundary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an older record from the
Triassic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty dubious, so I haven't
really included it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The record consists largely of plants,
so whole plants, also leaves and detached
[SPEAKER_01]: leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mostly what's found in the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few sporaeides, and even fewer
of these have spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interesting phenomenon that's
been noted by paleobotanists because these
[SPEAKER_01]: spores are so resistant, why aren't you
finding them in the fossil record?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of identification problems
historically and continuing to the present
[SPEAKER_01]: day with these ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things are misidentified into
this family.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the first projects I'm going
to talk about are the La Colonia
[SPEAKER_01]: marsileaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So La Colonia is one of the formations
that I've been working on with Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gandolfo and collaborators in Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are three of the papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two of them are from La Colonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's about marsileaceae, if you want to
read more about these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give two examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's a fossil taxon that's similar to a
modern fern, almost indistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is a fossil taxon with a
unique morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of these come from the La Colonia
formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit about this formation and
the context for these fossils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I should say this map is a little bit
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: South America was not tilted.
[SPEAKER_01]: North is kind of somewhere up over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The important thing though is the La
Colonia formation occurs down here in
[SPEAKER_01]: modern Chiboot province.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, it was very near the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sediments from this formation,
some of them were deposited in marine
[SPEAKER_01]: settings, some were deposited in
terrestrial settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of vertebrate fossils
known from this formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the most famous is Carnotaurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are marine vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just an example of what the
formation looks like today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the past, it looked very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the left two pictures show the
formation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The formation looks like what we might
call in the US badlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't a lot of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very eroded.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right is a reconstruction of what
the vegetation might have looked like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from a paper we published in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there aren't a lot of plant macrophosal
localities from the La Colonia formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three are Cerro Bosta, which is up
here, Cañadon del Rupe, and Quebrada del
[SPEAKER_01]: Elecho.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that these localities represent
coastal lagoon environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are essentially freshwater
environments near the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are three categories of plants
that are preserved in these environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of which were growing in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the things like the water
ferns I'll be showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Lumbo, there is also a floating
aquatic angiosperm that's maybe somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: like Pistia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lowland, wetland plants growing
around the lagoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Dixonaceous ferns that I showed you
before were part of this portion of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are plants that are growing
even further away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a macrophosal flora.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a pollinoflora.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pollen, spores, algae, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first example I'll be showing you
from this formation is fossil regnalidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern regnalidium, the leaf and the
megaspore are shown here on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember the leaf with two leaflets,
the megaspore with this nice acrylamella.
[SPEAKER_01]: This map summarizes the modern and fossil
distribution of regnalidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the present distribution is in a very
small portion of East Central South
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Northern Argentina, Uruguay,
Southern Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fossil record is kind of all over
the place, sparse, but widely dispersed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice a bunch of spore records
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the red circles in Eurasia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a few scattered macro and
mesofossil reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: So down here is an example of one of these
fossil spores from Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a nice acrylamella.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example of fossil leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are from Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this fossil spora carp from
Georgia in the United States, which
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't look like much, but it had very
nicely preserved spores in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't judge it by its cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are the fossils from La Colonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, modern is on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Center are the macro fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the right are dispersed
spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the sediments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gets us to one problem working as
a paleobotanist in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant organs are often not found in
attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plant pollen and spores are often not
found in situ.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not found within the organs
that produce them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have not found spores of
Marsiliaceae within the organs of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regnalidium macrofossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're assuming these two things go
together because they're found in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: deposits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming from the same family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else fits in terms of the
morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plant was probably producing these
spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll notice the macrofossils have
pairs of leaflets to their leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look almost exactly like the moderns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are some rhizomes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The venation is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regnalidium has these dichotomizing
veins and also a marginal vein near the
[SPEAKER_01]: apex of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this in the fossil as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispersed spores look very much like
modern regnalidium spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can compare the megaspores here to
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a paleobotanist, this is the easiest
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks just like the modern plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really much to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next example is a little trickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I get into it, I just want to
talk about Marsiliaceae a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some examples of Marsiliaceae
again with the leaves that look like four
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf clovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Modern Marsiliaceae probably has 50 or
more species distributed all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce nice spora carps,
which sometimes have these projections
[SPEAKER_01]: called teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the megaspores do not have a very
elaborate acrylamella on the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reduced to this rim.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marsiliaceae tends to be fairly
problematic in the fossil record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the most problematic member
of Marsiliaceae, maybe salvinia,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the reasons for that is because
there are things that look like
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsiliaceae in the fossil record that are
Marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some examples of Marsiliaceae
lookalikes that are probably angiosperms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reproductive structures haven't been
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the leaf denation looks angiospermous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of these is Marsiliaceae phylum
John Hollii from the Dakota Formation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice this has three leaves or leaflets
and a whorl, kind of a similar structure
[SPEAKER_01]: to Marsiliaceae leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here, Fortuna marsilioides,
this comes from the upper Cretaceous to
[SPEAKER_01]: Paleocene of Western Canada and the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are lookalikes in the fossil
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does complicate things a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Marsiliaceae leaflets have very
simple denation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to mix them up with other
reticulate-veined things in the fossil
[SPEAKER_01]: record.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is after a review I did in 2019,
what I think is the, I guess, legitimate
[SPEAKER_01]: fossil record of Marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that Marsiliaceae is spread
around the world, not in the Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemisphere so much, but in the Northern
Hemisphere in terms of its fossil record.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of spores in Eurasia and
some sporophyte reports based on leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: from North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaf records come from the upper
Cretaceous and also the ESE.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting things about this
record is that all of the spore records
[SPEAKER_01]: are younger than all of the leaf records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one debate in the literature about
Marsiliaceae is whether ancient
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsiliaceae produced a different spore
type, maybe a spore type that was similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to that of modern Regnolidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it turns out, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no Marsiliaceae spores have been
found in the same sediments or
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsiliaceae spores have been found in the
same sediments that yield these leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is still an open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the La Colonia Formation,
we do have a plant that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: like Marsiliaceae, but it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left are some pictures of modern
Marsiliaceae leaves and leaf denation.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the right are Myrosolita irupensis
leaves or leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the denation of Myrosolita irupensis is
very similar to the denation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veins dichotomize and they anastomose
and they form these closed aerials.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's different is first of all,
the form of the leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see this extended leaflet base
and maybe more of a fan-shaped leaflet
[SPEAKER_01]: Myrosolita versus these abdeltoid leaflets
in Marsiliaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole leaf structure was also probably
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we have two leaflets in
attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have a whole bunch of leaflets on
the surface of a rock and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell how they're related to one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we interpreted the leaves of this plant
as having two leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somewhat different from modern
Marsiliaceae but with some similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for completeness here, these spora
carps occur co-occur with the Myrosolita
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another problem in Paleobotany again,
organs tend to be detached.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not find the spora carps in
attachment with the leaflets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give them a different name,
even though we think they probably come
[SPEAKER_01]: from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here in the upper right, you can see
one of the Myrosolita leaflets near some
[SPEAKER_01]: spora carps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they occur very close to one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also myelosporous spores in
these sediments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible that this Myrosolita
Luigiomarsiglia plant was also producing
[SPEAKER_01]: myelosporous spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the only candidate right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so to wrap up this section,
Late Cretaceous Regnolidium was similar in
[SPEAKER_01]: form in terms of its leaves and spores to
modern Regnolidium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe an example of some extreme stasis
going on there from over 66 million years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago to the present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the Cretaceous and possibly even
later, Marsiliaceous plants may have had
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics of more than one modern
genus, and or they may have had unique
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics not seen in modern
Marsiliaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we get out of the La
Colonia Formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the remainder of the time,
I'd like to briefly go through some
[SPEAKER_01]: projects to do with Salviniaeaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soazolla and Salvinia, these floating
aquatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go through two scenarios
here, one involving Salvinia that has
[SPEAKER_01]: sporophyte characters not found in the
extant plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This study is actually not published yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something I'm working on with Pecundo
de Benedetti.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did an abstract at GSA last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second one is a published
study from 2019 on Azolla sporophytes and
[SPEAKER_01]: spores from the La Colonia Formation and
the younger Salamanca Formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so a little bit about Salvinia
just to get us acquainted with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salvinia plants are floating aquatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see here from Q the modern
distribution of Salvinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're native to large parts of the
world, but they are also introduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: large parts of the world where they can
cause some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing Salvinia is known as is an
invasive aquatic plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants grow on the surface of the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have horizontally growing rhizomes or
stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bear leaves in groups of three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have pairs of floating leaves,
which isn't really well visualized here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the floating leaves occur in pairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can occur flat on the water surface
or somewhat folded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each of these is associated with
a submerged leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the submerged leaf is a root-like
looking structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these plants have no true roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the submerged leaves that bear
the sore eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: The floating leaves have reticulate leaf
formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the aerials formed by the veins tend to
be elongate, rectangular to hexagonal in
[SPEAKER_01]: shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Salvinia is really known particularly
in the literature on materials research
[SPEAKER_01]: for its hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Salvinias, not all of them have egg
beater hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's an example of these egg beater
hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are hydrophobic hairs with
hydrophilic tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they help the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you drop a drop of water on a surface
of a Salvinia leaf, it'll beat up and it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps hold air against the surface of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is probably an adaptation to its
habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit more about the
reproductive structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that they are on the submerged
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that the sore eye are
homosperangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some sore eye had megasperangia that
produce megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other sore eye have microsperangia that
produce microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So megaspores and microspores are
separated into different sore eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just examples of the megaspores
and microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really going to talk about the
spore structure today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note the megaspores are much, much larger
than the microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these pictures are not to scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the fossil record of Salvinia,
I kind of feel like this is maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: neglected record of all the water ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: There actually is a pretty good literature
in this case on the spora finds,
[SPEAKER_01]: interestingly enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the map up here shows the fossil record
or distribution of the fossil record of
[SPEAKER_01]: Salvinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notably, there are some Cretaceous
occurrences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in North America, here's one that is
not described.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, we have one of these groups
going back to the Cretaceous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these pictures just show some of the
variety of fossil Salvinias.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them look very much like the modern
forms in terms of their overall structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I should mention, not on this map,
there are some reports from Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: including a Lake Cretaceous report and
some much younger reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fossils I will be showing today
come from the Hattiesburg formation of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also known as the Bowie River
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: The site was first reported in the
literature in detail in 2019 by McNair et
[SPEAKER_01]: al and Paleontologia electronica.
[SPEAKER_01]: If some of you were here when Mack Alfred
was a graduate student, he was on that
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may remember him.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting things about this
site is it's one of the few neogene fossil
[SPEAKER_01]: plant macrophosal localities in Eastern
North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are very few neogene plant
macrophosal sites in the Eastern part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neogene is 23 million years ago to 2.6
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: 6 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this part of the fossil record is
really relevant for understanding our
[SPEAKER_01]: modern flora, understanding modern plant
disjunctions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best neogene record in our country,
in the Eastern part of our country is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Gulf Coast area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see sort of a cluster of sites
down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the major sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other sites that are maybe a bit
more minor or haven't been worked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hattiesburg yields leaves, fruit,
seeds and pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it yields selvinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this fossil might be a little bit
harder to interpret than some of the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite as well preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The matrix it is in falls apart if you
even look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll notice there are pairs of
floating leaves here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another floating leaf here that's
preserved sort of face on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit easier to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a submerged leaf down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The branches are visible there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a sorus here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some very nice preserved sori
on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is a poorly preserved
structure here called a float.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see the corresponding structures
on a modern selvinia plant except for the
[SPEAKER_01]: float.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it turns out floats are not seen
on modern selvinias.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's only been
documented from fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here on the arrows and in this blow up
in the center are some other pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: the floats in this Hattiesburg selvinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are also called literature inflated
structures, which is maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody knows exactly what the function of
these things are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have been found in other fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some fossil selvinia from
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the actual fossil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a drawing reconstructing what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some floats from an Eocene
selvinia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is older than the Hattiesburg
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up here are some examples from Europe,
which are slightly older to about the same
[SPEAKER_01]: age as the Hattiesburg material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is sort of an interesting
observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure where it's going to go yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that's interesting about
the Hattiesburg selvinia are the sori.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these fossils, the mega sporangia
marked by ME and the micro sporangia
[SPEAKER_01]: marked by MI occur in the same source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sori are heterosporangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing both megaspores and
microspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: In modern selvinias, the typical case,
I guess there have been some observations
[SPEAKER_01]: of very occasional observations of
heterosporangia sori.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the typical case is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's a microsporangia sorus
producing the microspores and a
[SPEAKER_01]: megasporangia sorus producing the
megaspores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heterosporangia sori in selvinia have been
documented previously in the fossil
[SPEAKER_01]: record.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a character we don't
really see in modern taxa.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final example quickly is azolla,
the mosquito ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So azolla are really tiny floating ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in the upper center there a
picture of one of these on somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: finger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very small ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have horizontally growing stems or
rhizomes that bear simple leaves that are
[SPEAKER_01]: imbricate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the leaves overlap one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have roots that hang down into
the water column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like selvinia, the sori in azolla are even
either megasporangia or microsporangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the herbarium specimen here,
you can see some microsporangia sori.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microsporangia sori are often more
conspicuous because they have multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: microsporangia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The megasporangia sori only have one
megasporangium producing one megaspore
[SPEAKER_01]: each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sort of ovoid in shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves of azolla have cavities in them
that harbor cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the things that makes
azolla economic interest because it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used to help enrich soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the distribution of modern azolla.
[SPEAKER_01]: The species boundaries of some of these
are a little bit fuzzy, but it just gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you the idea that it occurs widely
throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores of azolla are also really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the microspores occur in groups in a
matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these groups are known as massulae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the massulae actually have hairs on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hairs are sometimes called glycidia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of azollas, the hairs have these
anchor shaped or arrow shaped tips on the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some, the tips might just be pointed or
especially in the fossil record,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see some that are searching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're curled almost like a young
fern.
[SPEAKER_01]: The megaspores are also pretty
spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sometimes called megaspore
apparatuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the megaspore has a megaspore body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it has this rim called the
collar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one end, it has these structures
that are called floats.
[SPEAKER_01]: In modern azolla, there can be three
floats in one tier or nine floats in two
[SPEAKER_01]: tiers on the megaspore apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is sorting in azolla by clade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The three floated species and the species
with anchor tipped glycidia occur in one
[SPEAKER_01]: clade section azolla.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nine floated species that either
have no hairs on their massulae or simple
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not anchor shaped tips are in section
rhizosperma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fossil record of azolla is
extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The map up here just shows the sporophyte
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice again, we have a lot of records
from the Northern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot from the Southern hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really probably reflective of
collecting effort and publication
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities more than it is maybe
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the spore record begins in the late
early Cretaceous, the Albion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, there are a lot of
multi-floated species of azolla megaspore
[SPEAKER_01]: apparatuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these would be apparatuses with more
than nine floats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they occur from the late Cretaceous to
the Eocene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this gives some impression that
there's a little bit of directionality in
[SPEAKER_01]: the evolution of these species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sporophyte record is known from the
late Cretaceous to the Miocene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are about 14 species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the two I'll show today are from South
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first of these azolla coloniensis
comes from the La Colonia Formation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I talked about earlier with
Ragnolidium and Myrosolida.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left are the sporophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily have a lot to say
about these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not so different from modern
azolla in their structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a slight difference in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see Megasprangiosaurus here and
Microscrangiosauri down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the interesting things about this
species is that it's associated with these
[SPEAKER_01]: spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are linked under the same name,
azolla coloniensis, but the spores have
[SPEAKER_01]: not been found in C2.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been found dispersed in the same
sediments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the megaspore apparatuses have many
floats, 18 to greater than 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microspore maculae have these hairs
with anchor-shaped tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these were described by Dave Benedetti
et al.
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another species of azolla from a
slightly younger formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Salamanca Formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's daily in age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 66 to 61.6 million years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also comes from Chibu Province,
Argentina.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same general region as the La
Colonia Formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about the
sporophytes of azolla caheuja is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots occur in fascicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they occur in these big groups on the
sporophyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very much like a modern
species called azolla nilotica,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is native only to Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores, the megaspore apparatuses,
have six floats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, these could not be directly
observed because they're under a cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this interpretation is based on
impressions in that cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microspore maculae have these
spine-like hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have the anchor-shaped ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the interesting things to note
about this is the complication it presents
[SPEAKER_01]: for understanding the evolution of azolla.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to azolla caheuja,
and azolla nilotica, there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: fossil species with these fascicle roots,
azolla schophii, that comes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Paleocene of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a similar age to the Argentinian
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this azolla has multi-floated
megaspore apparatuses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what these things are suggesting is
that there really isn't, if they're part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the same lineage, which we kind of
think they might be because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: these fascicle roots and some other
features that are similar, there isn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear directionality in the number of
floats on the spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 15 to more than 20 in this one,
six in this one, and then nine in the
[SPEAKER_01]: modern.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to conclude this part of the talk,
fossil azolla and salvinia species have
[SPEAKER_01]: some characteristics not seen in the
modern forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fossil record of azolla really
complicates our understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: morphological evolution in the genus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess to conclude, the fossil record
adds a lot of richness to our
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of the morphology of the
water ferns and potentially to our
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of their evolution,
particularly the morphological character
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of danger maybe in
overinterpreting things or in
[SPEAKER_01]: misidentifying things, especially in
Marsileaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with that, I'll take any
questions.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the salvinia floats by
the evolving symbiosis given, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: azolla has that side effect in the leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting question and I have no
idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the floats supposedly a leaf
structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like a leaf-like structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at them, they have like a
very thick mid vein on them and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: reticulate venation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do look like sort of some sort of
modified leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know if the ferns you talked about
are in breeding or out of crossing and if
[SPEAKER_00]: that depends on which source they produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sorry I can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the function of the acrolamela?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it work for fertilization?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first question and second one is like
Marsileaceae have these parallel veins,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the salvinia has more reticulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is possible that the extinct plants
have this, the ancestral had different
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a venation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be not just parallel,
it might be something different because
[SPEAKER_03]: the sister clay has a different kind of
venation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure about the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid acrolamela to address your first
question, if I can get out here or maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was going to go back to one of
the earlier slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gelatinous bell, there is a sperm
lake inside where the sperm gather prior
[SPEAKER_01]: to fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a really nice paper on it,
I think by Schneider and Pryor that talks
[SPEAKER_01]: all about the fertilization in these
ferns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure how much the solid
acrolamela is involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question was about the venation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Marsilea actually does have reticulate
venation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The venation in salvinia is more complex,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ragnolidium has dichotomizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the ancestral fern,
my guess would be it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: dichotomizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there isn't a clear stem member
of the entire order in the fossil record
[SPEAKER_01]: so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where is the hydrotiridium placed?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the analyses place it as a stem
member of salvinia ac, although an
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative placement is as stem salvinia
ales, at least in one analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's rodent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's a little bit more Marsilea
ac like in its structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in terms of its rhizome.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The salvinia weird rootlet things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your interpretation, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you figure out how many are involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is it one kind of stem that leaves
on it, or are they coming directly off the
[SPEAKER_04]: upper one?
