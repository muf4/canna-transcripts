[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I start, I am Randy Lacey.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I own Hopshire Brewery,
which if you don't know where that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on Route 13, which is still called
Dryden Road, two miles past the NYSEG
[SPEAKER_00]: building where 366 and Route 13 meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been there almost four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I start, I've got a couple
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you generally, you can just raise your
hands, do you generally think of beer as
[SPEAKER_00]: an agricultural product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has a designation of a farm
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe that that designation means
you have to grow something that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in your beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get New York's farm brewery license
and commit to using New York grown barley
[SPEAKER_00]: and hops in every beer, do you believe the
state gives some kind of tax incentives or
[SPEAKER_00]: other financial support to help those
farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple, not many.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, when you talk about
wine, the term terroir is a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe the term terroir is part of
the conversation about beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple, not so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're going to talk about all those
things and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a little bit of,
we only have an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take questions along the way,
or at the end if something's burning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just need to ask it, go ahead,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk a little bit about
world history of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about why beer styles
developed in different places of different
[SPEAKER_00]: styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to talk, shift more
regionally and talk about beer history in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll talk about some beer
ingredients and what's happening now with
[SPEAKER_00]: craft breweries and particularly farm
breweries in New York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that's what you came here to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopshire is a family owned business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only two partners in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my wife and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have two sons and both sons are
married.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's actually six of us that are
part of the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I should have mentioned,
I have a long history with Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an alum of the engineering school and
I worked at the university for 38 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 20 as director of facilities
engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked in every building,
which really is handy because I know where
[SPEAKER_00]: the restrooms are, whatever building I go
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a thing that's been quite useful
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get into, let's say you decide
you want to have a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to open a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set up and have the beer made by
someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called contract brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't actually have to make beer to
open a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: People forget that Ithaca beer opened
without making beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were contracted and their beer was
made at a different brewery and bottled in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca bottles and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most interesting stories in
recent history is three heads in Rochester
[SPEAKER_00]: opened a brewery and it cost them less
than $20,000 because that was just to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate the business, develop graphics
and develop beer recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their beer was then brewed by custom brew
crafters in Western New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for several years, three heads grew
quite fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they weren't making beer,
they had the beer made by someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a year ago, they opened a big
brewery in Rochester to brew their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contract brewing is certainly one way
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can invest in existing brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build a brewery in some leased
space on municipal services, water and
[SPEAKER_00]: sewer, so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build a brewery on land that you
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my last choice here is purchase
land, build a brewery and farm with no
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these are kind of increasing
complexity and challenges to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was our model?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been growing hops for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a founding board member of the
Northeast Hop Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife and I visited a lot of
breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned that there's no single model
for breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's big ones, little ones,
people's basements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our model was to put the brewery on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of like the concept of the
wineries where you drive up through the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellises of grapes to get to the tasting
room and you can see where the grapes are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to bring that idea to our
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted the tasting room and the
building to honor New York's great
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage, particularly through the 19th
century of growing hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to use as many New York
ingredients as we could and demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: hop farming and the brewing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our primary goals is to
demystify the brewing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever toured a really,
really large brewery, it's a factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much equipment and so many
tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the scale is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that brewing is very,
very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brewing is not complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do it in the kitchen all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It only has a few ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ingredients want to be beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to demystify that and show
people that beer is actually a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: simple product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pictures are some of the heritage
of hop growing in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: The building is typical of a hop barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hops would be dried in that pointy
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 100 years, New York was the producer
of hops in North America, 1800 to 1900.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're typically grown on small farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't have specific hop farms,
but many farms would have two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: acres of hops in addition to the other
things that they grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, all picked by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tremendous amount of work to pick the
hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would generally take the whole pole
down and people would pick it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were even migrant groups that would
go around to pick hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brewing was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than the one in the upper right,
the Albany Brewing Company, the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are all Syracuse breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1900, Syracuse had 40 breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them were bigger than Ithaca
Beer is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they weren't small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were big breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the picture in the middle,
Greenways Brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great name for a brewery,
Greenways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those buildings are part of the
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a malt house.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably barrel making in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a place that would have been to
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in Syracuse in 1900.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York has a tremendous history of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing hops and brewing beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to remember that around that
time, beer wasn't bottled or canned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer was put in barrels and sent to
taverns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to drink beer, you went to a tavern,
you drank beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means most beer was very locally
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was also no refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So breweries were where the people were,
which is kind of an important concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from an encyclopedia in 1904.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great is it's got those
barrels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you can't see it, but you can't
read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the barrels are all scaled to the
production of beer in that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this big guy is a New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Pennsylvania is pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so today, the big beer industry states
are California, Colorado, Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, those were really
relatively small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's cool about this is, again,
if you looked at population of those
[SPEAKER_00]: states, it probably is directly
proportional to the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer was made where people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a different concept than we
have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about beer ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer is made from four ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barley malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hops, water, and yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a German purity law from the 1400s
that declares beer can only be made from
[SPEAKER_00]: three ingredients because they didn't know
about yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only allowed barley, hops,
and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeast is, of course, a very important
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really simple ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two really interesting organic
processes that occur in brewing beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is when you add hot water to the
barley malt, and the enzyme in the malt
[SPEAKER_00]: converts the starch to sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every brewery needs to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one is when you add the
yeast to the very sweet liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it ferments it into carbon dioxide and
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are great processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stories about whoever
figured this out, but it goes way,
[SPEAKER_00]: way back in human history, a long,
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to talk about now is how
beer evolved around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can go in a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go into Finger Lakes Beverage,
and you can buy any kind of beer you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing how many kinds of beer
there are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in history, people grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put their water together with that,
and they came out with a certain type of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Munich, Germany,
you came out with this dark beer that's
[SPEAKER_00]: now called Munich style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in Czechoslovakia in the
Pilsen region, you would come out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: very light, bright Pilsner ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in England, you'd come out
with more of a fruity, English-style beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in England, the water had a lot of
salts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pilsen, the water was very,
very clean, had no salts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people put their ingredients together,
and they got a certain beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people in that region learned to
love that beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like you had options about what
to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You drank the beer that was made with your
local ingredients, very, very much about
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not so true anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy grain, and I can get grain
that's been grown and malted in Belgium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get German grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get British grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really get whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these strains of yeast that used
to be, they weren't even known.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just natural around the world in
different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've now isolated those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy any yeast you want from any
brewery in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually make whatever beer you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know enough about water conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make my water look like British
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make my water look like Pilsen
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make it look like Munich water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now people can really brew kind of
anything they want to, which is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about grapes,
this term terroir comes up because wine is
[SPEAKER_00]: made only from the grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grape is grown in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets your level of water during the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you press it, everything that
comes out of that grape came from your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer is not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer is 90% water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your water source is hugely important
when you're talking about beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really think about terroir
with beer unless you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Budweiser has plants around the US and
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their goal is to make exactly the same
beer, regardless of where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really, really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're actually trying to do is
remove any aspect of terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that beer brewed in Columbus,
Ohio to taste exactly like the one in St.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis or Baldwin'sville, New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're trying to remove, even though
the grains were grown different places
[SPEAKER_00]: and, of course, very different water
sources in all of those towns,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they want to make the beer exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually fairly hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most breweries use municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using municipal water,
you can't even think about talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir, because that water has been
purified to drop out sediment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been chlorinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any aspect it had of its local terroir is
gone, including Coors Rocky Mountain
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring Water, which is the same water that
everyone in Golden, Colorado, drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down Clear Creek, and then it
goes into a treatment plant, and it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: treated, and everyone drinks the same
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really interesting is that beer
ingredients don't go just anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in a very specific latitude band
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S., this graph is showing where
barley can be grown and where it's malted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a couple years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice there's no dots for malt houses in
New York, and there weren't at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: this graph was produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's now 10 malt houses in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key message here is that barley is
only grown in certain places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hops are only grown in a certain latitude
band, which is even smaller than this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, hops are grown in Germany,
Czechoslovakia, England, and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's New York, Wisconsin, Michigan,
and then, of course, the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest, Oregon, Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's really great about New York is
that we can grow barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we grow many, many other things
that can be interesting in beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a wide range of berries,
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of things that can be used in
beer can be grown in New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really a pretty cool thing for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is... I love this chart because it
tells so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the history of beers and brewery
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: since 1800.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red line, the red single line,
this one, it goes up to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up there and spikes and comes back
down, is number of breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the yellow filled bar is amount
of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the number of breweries back in
the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph says 4,100 breweries in about
18... call it 1865.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that much beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those breweries were making small
amounts of beer, even though there were a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were neighborhood breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breweries were where the people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, everything... breweries
were actually starting to consolidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of breweries was dropping and
breweries were... small breweries were
[SPEAKER_00]: being bought up by big ones even before
Prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Prohibition, 1920, no beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: No breweries, no beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that, no hops because hops
were useless at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hops really don't have any other use other
than beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have no market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you weren't making beer for 13
years, anyone that was growing hops pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: them out and put in something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New York, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were... actually hops in New York
peaked about 1880 and after that point was
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to move west where the summers
were longer and the yield per acre was
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then New York got hit with a blight
about 1910.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another nail in the coffin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally Prohibition finally did
it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hops after Prohibition did not come
back in New York because by then New York
[SPEAKER_00]: was a huge dairy state and people were
using every available acre for cows,
[SPEAKER_00]: for dairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after Prohibition, not a lot of
breweries came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that did either failed,
many failed, or again were consolidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the dark years of breweries in
the United States were sort of in this
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch of 1960 to 1980 when there were
very, very few breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the bottom here is like 44
breweries in the US in about 1980,
[SPEAKER_00]: 44 breweries making a lot of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these breweries, even though there
weren't many of them, they were huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all making a lot of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know for sure why the number of
breweries started to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there were a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, the growth of new
breweries wasn't people splitting off that
[SPEAKER_00]: worked at big breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those aren't the ones that started small
breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly home brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like Ken Grossman that started
Sierra Nevada in 1980, he was a home
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big factors in the growth
of those breweries and the growth of home
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing was in 1976, Jimmy Carter signed a
law that made home brewing legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until that point, home brewing was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that people didn't do it,
but you didn't have home brew clubs like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ithaca Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have home brew shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have mail order home brew
supply places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really, there wasn't a lot of it
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it was legal, then you did have
clubs and shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then each state had its own state had
to make home brewing legal, which took
[SPEAKER_00]: some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last state was like two years ago,
so it actually took quite a bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was mostly home brewers that
started the new movement of small
[SPEAKER_00]: breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because if you worked at a big
brewery, you probably did one specific
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really didn't know the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas home brewers do the whole thing,
so they started small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other cool thing about what was
happening in 1980 was there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment for small breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't go buy a small fermenter or a
small kettle because breweries were huge
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Sierra Nevada got started,
they bought dairy equipment, which is all
[SPEAKER_00]: stainless steel, modified it, and made
small brewing equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different than it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I can order any size fermenter I
want from one barrel to 60 barrels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can have it in less than two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that whole industry has really,
really changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So notice, too, a couple other things to
notice out of this, that from about 1970
[SPEAKER_00]: on, the total beer consumption has been
flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, many years, the total beer
consumption in the US has dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that the big brewers
are very concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, craft beer continues to grow at a
pretty high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see big breweries trying to get
into the craft beer market, and they try
[SPEAKER_00]: all different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this graph ends at 2010, but if the red
line could continue, it would now be over
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be over the number of breweries
that existed way back in the 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most breweries that the US has
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but it's really kind of an
amazing thing that there are now breweries
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, popping up all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is licensing a brewery about
every 10 days and has been, for over two
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth of breweries in New York is
really huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a neat little chart
showing all the different types of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scale on the bottom, it goes from
bitter on the bottom to sweet on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes, ales are all on this side of
the median, and lagers are on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in each one, it goes from a very
light color to a dark color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many, many styles of beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have dark lagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have sweet lagers, bitter lagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way over here is Guinness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dark and bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all different sorts of styles
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's IPAs would be very bitter and
light colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's amazing about this is back in
that trough when there were 40 breweries
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US, they all made the same style of
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all made this beer right there,
that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Bavarian lager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Coors, it's Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all the same beer in terms of
beer styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of all that beer was consumed,
most of it was this beer right here and
[SPEAKER_00]: not any of these other styles,
which is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really weren't beer choices at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically, that's still 90% of the
beer consumed in the US is Miller,
[SPEAKER_00]: Coors, Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think, oh wow, this craft beer
thing has really taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just last year crossed 10% of the total
beer consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you talk craft beer, you're still
including breweries like Ying Ling,
[SPEAKER_00]: Sierra Nevada, Sam Adams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all considered craft breweries,
and they're huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put all those in, and you still
only have 12% of the total beer consumed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US, which is kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear news about craft brewing,
and you think this has really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: taken over the beer world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some ways it has, but in terms of
quantity, it still hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still many, many people out there
that haven't had a craft beer and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: drink craft beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this chart is one of the
reasons why craft beer is growing so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because people who thought they
didn't like beer only knew one type of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that they try other types of beer,
beers brewed with ginger, Belgian ales,
[SPEAKER_00]: beers brewed with fruit, all sorts of
things, they're now discovering,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, there's some beers I do like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always take it as a challenge when
someone comes in our tasting room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're with a group of other people,
and they say, we asked who's doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting, and someone will say,
no thanks, I really don't like beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that as a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe they just haven't met the right
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have beers that are actually more
like wine than beer in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: dryness and their fruitiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll always go to the wine spectrum
and try to bring them back that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of beers out there that
you can make that are not what was
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally considered beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fun to try that on with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk now about New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has passed this farm brewery law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went into effect 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law was, I think, I felt it was really
brilliant in its terms, because New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State didn't spend any money on this to
promote farm breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it did was it gave breweries that
committed to use New York Grain and New
[SPEAKER_00]: York Hops, it gave them privileges that
other breweries didn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it made it financially advantageous for
me as a brewer, but the state wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: spending the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, the big one was it allowed
us to sell beer by the pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up till this point, if you were a
brewery, you could do a tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could charge for your tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But each person that came in could only do
the tasting round once, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't sell them more beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could buy a growler to go,
but they couldn't stay there and have
[SPEAKER_00]: another beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't stay there and do this
tasting a second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law is pretty clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this law did was if you committed
to be a farm brewery and use New York
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, I could sell beer by the
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really a game changer,
because now people could stay for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could sell them beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have music, and people would come
in and stay and listen to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have events where people would
come and buy beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a minute, I'll talk about why
selling beer by the glass is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: better for a brewery than selling it by
the keg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the law is structured,
it's a graduated stepping system so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when the law was first established,
each farm brewery had to use 20% New
[SPEAKER_00]: York-grown barley or grain of any type and
20% New York-grown hops in every batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't make 100% New York beer
and then forget it on the next three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to use 20% in every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the law is still structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's structured this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those amounts increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to 60% in 2019, and then it goes
to 90% in 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, that's a debate that's
going on among the breweries, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: that's possible or even advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was there was this great
incentive that farm breweries could sell
[SPEAKER_00]: beer by the pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were the fifth brewery in New
York to get the farm brewery license.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's now over 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's now lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a year after this law went into
effect, another one went into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let all breweries in New York sell by
the pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that had separated farm
breweries from other breweries was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: leveled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's a bad thing,
except there now aren't special privileges
[SPEAKER_00]: for farm breweries because everybody can
sell beer by the pint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or by the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these other benefits are still specific
to farm breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can open five satellites on that one
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could open, for instance,
I have my brewery in Freeville.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could open a tasting room in downtown
Ithaca, and it would be the same license,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the state's concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can serve food as a restaurant or bed
and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sell the product of any other New
York farm brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm winery or farm distillery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, I could only sell bottles to
drink offsite.
[SPEAKER_00]: In November of last year, that law was
changed that I can sell glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can sell glasses of wine,
as long as the wine is from a New York
[SPEAKER_00]: farm winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sell distilled spirits,
if that's from a New York farm distillery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about it, our bar could
look a lot like a real bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have mixed drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of stayed away from the spirits
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have selected four New York wines that
we're serving at our tasting room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big things was that the farm
breweries are clearly designated as an
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my first questions was,
do you consider beer to be an agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: product?
[SPEAKER_00]: This law made it very specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brewery is part of an agricultural
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big deal because prior to this,
any brewery was, in terms of zoning laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: considered industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could only be located in industrial
zoned areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breweries were big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were thought to be factories,
and you could only put them in industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This very specifically says it's a farm
operation, and you can put it in a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that's zoned agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: My site in Dryden is zoned agricultural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without this, I couldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why breweries are now popping up
all over on the wine trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, there's now over 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any farm brewery can sell at a farmer's
market or the state fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sell closed containers to go,
or you can do tastings or bottles or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been a little fuzzy part of the
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether a glass with a lid is a closed
container or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say no more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a business that sells beer,
brewed someplace else, which was the norm
[SPEAKER_00]: until a few years ago, the benefit goes to
retail stores, taverns, restaurants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't a lot of people in the state
that really take advantage from that beer
[SPEAKER_00]: being brought in by a truck and sold at a
restaurant, other than the person
[SPEAKER_00]: retailing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the beer is brewed locally,
you have all of these other, now you have
[SPEAKER_00]: breweries, equipment suppliers,
service trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that's familiar with the expansion,
I think a beer just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a lot of people that had jobs
locally to put that addition on the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the beer is brewed locally,
now you've got a bunch of other people
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That beer being made in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further, if you go even farther and say,
oh, the beer is brewed with New York
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients, now you've got grain and hop
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got malt houses, hop producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else is now enjoying some of
that income from the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of it staying in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really economically a very
healthy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor has been totally on board
with this and really promoted New York
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing and farm brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure a lot of consumers are
like, hip with this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another illustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grew barley, that's about what
you'd get for selling a ton of barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you turn that same barley into malt for
brewing, now it's worth quite a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you turn the malted barley into
beer, now you're really talking about some
[SPEAKER_00]: real money out of that bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same barley, but you've turned
it into beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the state's terms, that's called value
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took something and you turned it into
a much more valued product than you
[SPEAKER_00]: started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what brewing with New York
ingredients is really all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide is not at all about beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think it's about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the farm winery law is parallel to
what's happening with farm breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm winery law in New York went into
effect in 1976.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, there were 14 wineries in
the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, they were all big, and they're
all considered industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this number is probably shy,
but there's over 350 wineries in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are farm wineries that you
drive up and down Cougan, Seneca,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cuca, wineries all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those wineries are now considered to
be a $4.8 billion industry in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: state because of one law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the potential for breweries is
even greater than it was with wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, many more people drink beer
than wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth in breweries already is really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are breweries in New York in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years later, that's how many we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a slide with the current
number of breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was put together by the National
Brewers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, 2013 is when the farm
brewery law went into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the number really started to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do you notice about this is
breweries are where people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overlaid the population of the
state, it'd look a lot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than some of the vacation areas,
like look at the Finger Lakes is really
[SPEAKER_00]: big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, the Hudson Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that, the breweries are
collected where Buffalo, Rochester,
[SPEAKER_00]: Syracuse, Albany area, and then downstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of moving back to that
pattern of the breweries being located
[SPEAKER_00]: where people are, which is kind of a neat
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another slide put together by
the Brewers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was, I get asked a lot,
is the market going to get saturated with
[SPEAKER_00]: breweries in New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you consider some other states,
the answer is probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, look at Oregon and
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had the same number of breweries per
capita that those states have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have almost 800 breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 240.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would imply there's a lot of room
for expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a son in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was there this summer,
he was going to take us to some breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go out driving in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wait, there's a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next block you turn, there's a
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those aren't the ones you want to go
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked the ones you want to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many breweries in Boulder that
it's like nobody goes to a bar anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't make the beer there,
people don't go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every little neighborhood brewery kind
of has their own thing that they do,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think is really, really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, of course, a lot of concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: One concern is whether we will saturate
the market and that some of these will
[SPEAKER_00]: fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's concern over ingredients,
both in terms of craft beer and in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the farm breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of craft beer, craft beer
typically consumes more malt and more hops
[SPEAKER_00]: than those American domestic beers per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the number of craft breweries in
the US really jumped a lot, there probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be enough ingredients for all
those breweries to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true of New York farm
breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the number of farm breweries jumps or
we hit that 60% number and it's still in
[SPEAKER_00]: place, there may not be enough barley and
hops grown in New York to support all
[SPEAKER_00]: those breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in brewing beer, you have a wide,
wide range of malted barley that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: malted and then kilned or cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, the maltsters in New York have
learned pretty well how to malt it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means wetting the grain,
getting it to sprout, and then drying it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's base malt that's used in most
beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in dark beers or amber beers,
you use that because these malts have been
[SPEAKER_00]: kilned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the malters in New York haven't
figured that out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably won't figure it out in the
next two years because you're comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: them to malt houses that have been doing
this for over 100 years, in some cases of
[SPEAKER_00]: British malt houses, almost 300 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've really taken a long time to
figure this out and get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that malt is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like roasting coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get roasted barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those grains won't be available in New
York in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a similar thing that happens on
the hop side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hops in New York are all public domain
hops that were developed, for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, by the University of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get Cascade is the predominant
one grown in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them were developed for New York,
but they actually grow quite well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hops that people love for the big
IPAs are varieties like Simcoe,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosaic, Citra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were developed by hop breeders and
then trademarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they license them only to certain
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they so far haven't licensed them to
any farms in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a problem because if you're
making an IPA, you really want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: these hops that are not grown in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can mix in New York hops,
but at 60% or 90%, you probably still
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get the beers that you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all issues about the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, the farm brewery law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about business in
case any of you think you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: open a brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think as a beer consumer,
it's still important for you to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can make beer, and you can sell it
a lot of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the money you make from that beer
depends on how you sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all the same beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sell kegs, you're getting about
$200 a barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A barrel is 31 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can sell that beer by the glass
at retail, you're getting almost seven
[SPEAKER_00]: times the value for the same beer,
the same quantity of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the farm brewery law that let
farm breweries sell by the glass was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without it, I can sell this,
and I can sell growlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with it, I can sell pints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have music every Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our busiest night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell a lot of glasses of beer on
Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have music if I couldn't sell
beer by the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look at the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it cost to make beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the low end, maybe $100 a barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the high end, maybe over $200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the difference between a low end
and a high end?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is New York grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York grain is twice the cost of,
for instance, Canadian malt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be maybe Canadian,
and this would be maybe New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hops in New York are about three times the
cost of West Coast hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use New York hops,
that's on the high side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also do beer with honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one style of beer that uses 70
pounds of honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey is certainly expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use ginger that's grown at Good Life
Farms in Interlaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are expensive ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really putting you over here on
this high price side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens when you put the two
charts together?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using expensive ingredients and
you're selling kegs, there's almost no
[SPEAKER_00]: margin in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly not enough margin to pay
for a building and brew it and pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and all of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to sell your beer some
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sell it in growlers or pints
in order to make the equation work at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wineries figured this out a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many wineries in New York that
only sell their wine at the tasting room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't sell it to wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see it in wine shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it out the door so that they
make more money out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also like to sell it by the glass,
which is why so many wineries have music
[SPEAKER_00]: and events to bring people in,
because that makes it work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stay in business that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stay in business if they sell
it only wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true of breweries.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's really changed my
thinking since we opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to believe that the successful
brewery was the one that sold lots of kegs
[SPEAKER_00]: to bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could go all over Ithaca and see my
taps and drink my beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, that's success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I learned what bars pay for kegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided that's not really the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've worked much harder to expand what
we can sell at the brewery and not so much
[SPEAKER_00]: what we can sell in terms of kegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The keg market is really competitive with
big breweries keeping the price per kegs
[SPEAKER_00]: down to a point where I can't really
compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consumers are willing to pay more for
beer if it's local.
[SPEAKER_00]: But consumers, it's sort of like how long
it's taken New York wine to catch on in
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people recognize that a locally
made beer is a good thing and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something they want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't take that next step and
say, it's a locally brewed beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but where did the ingredients come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people running restaurants and
stuff don't go that far either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when we sell it at our brewery,
we can talk about where the ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about what went in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're representing our beer one on one
when you do a tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different way to sell beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've learned that the way for us to
grow is not to necessarily keep expanding
[SPEAKER_00]: production and making more and more beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way for us to grow is get more people
into our brewery with events, with an
[SPEAKER_00]: event room, and sell more beer at the
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll see a lot of other
small breweries kind of following that
[SPEAKER_00]: same model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about it, we've become a
neighborhood brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that come to us, particularly
on Friday night, live within five miles of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see their friends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see people they met at the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really very much a communal thing
of people coming out on Friday night to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear music, to talk to their friends,
eat food, and, of course, drink beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been a good thing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until a month ago, we'd clean out the
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the taste room, but we outgrew
that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would move stuff in the brewery so
we could put bands in there, or people in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, or food in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was the taste room and the
brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a lot of work to move
everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we outgrew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've built a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1,200 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost like as soon as you open
it, it's full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now on Fridays, our event room is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the band and the food
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tasting room is a little more
open, which is great because people can
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and just get growlers or whatever
they want and leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be working out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also doing a lot of private events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a retirement party for someone last
night so people can book the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody's looking for a graduation
space, there's still some space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's space available around Cornell
graduation if you're looking for a space
[SPEAKER_00]: to get your family together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we do a lot of
outside stuff in the summer with tents and
[SPEAKER_00]: picnic tables and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the end of my prepared
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer questions for as long
as you want to stay.
Yep.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water, mostly it's what's in the water
other than water, minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is very common in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly it's the salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in a well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out we had really,
really nice water, meaning very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very soft water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have a lot of minerals in it,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I can make a lot of styles
of beer because I can add minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if I'm making an IPA or an
English style beer, I actually add food
[SPEAKER_00]: grade gypsum to the water to make it
different water than I can make it more
[SPEAKER_00]: like London water, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was saying is if you're in a
city and you have municipal water,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that's true anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, anything that was original with that
water has been gone because it went
[SPEAKER_00]: through a treatment plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of breweries then retreat the
water at the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing you had to do is take out
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every municipal water is chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine is terrible for beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to remove it to brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most home brewers figure that out when
they make their first batch from tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got this awful flavor from
chloramines in very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've developed a model where there are
three beers that we have all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I should talk about a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beer made with all New York grown
ingredients, all the barley, all the hops,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lots of local honey in that beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has turned out to be the beer we make
the most of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the beer we sell the most of in
the tasting room, but a lot of bars and
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurants like Behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make more of that than anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the cool things that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got pretty excited right before we
opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to figure out which beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened with six beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was trying to figure out what those
beers would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had friends that opened a brewery
and said, you've got to have a light beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have something very light
and very drinkable because people will
[SPEAKER_00]: come in that have not had craft beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to want to go to the
lightest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a home brewer, you don't make light
beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make strong beers, dark beers,
but you don't make light beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got very excited that I could make
certain beers with all New York
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one was specifically designed
because I could only get the light grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get dark grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get a lot of hops, so it's low
in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could get lots of honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one we always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Scottish ale, which is very
chocolatey and malty, low in hops,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's 8% alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called Shire ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our IPA is called New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's near Varna because our brewery is
near Varna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a big citrusy IPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to use more and more New
York local hops in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Behave is the closest beer to
maybe having some local terroir because
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is out of our well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hops are all cascaded, grown locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The honey is all from the same guy in
Moravia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get basswood honey is my preferred
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mostly what we use in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one really has a chance to have
some local terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a great beer and a very
popular beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it will typically have 8 to 10 at
the tasting room because we have seasonals
[SPEAKER_00]: that move around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we have two Irish beers,
a red and a stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a black IPA that we have all
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to release our summer IPA,
which is a session, much lower alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bright fruity mosaic hops,
one of those hops I can't get from New
[SPEAKER_00]: York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just brewed a wheat beer that will be a
raspberry wheat beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd be surprised how many beers use
flavorings, food flavorings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a colorless bottle, food
flavoring and smell, and they dump it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beer when it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have, for instance,
an apricot wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our raspberry wheat is 40 pounds of
raspberry puree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes in the beer in a fermenter,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we use gin gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have a Belgian on tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do different Belgians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do one with ginger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current one is a Belgian strong
golden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a dark Abbey ale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've brewed over 50 beers since we
opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about the beers available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's 5,000 breweries, and we're
small and we've brewed 50 different ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a lot of beers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing you don't think about is how
hard it is to come up with a unique beer
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up with a beer name and Google it,
I guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first 10 you think of that are good
names will be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our black IPA, I was looking in the
kettle, and it was rolling, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: shining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, that looks like obsidian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopsidian, what a perfect name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came right down off the ladder on
the kettle, and I went to the computers
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I came up with 10 black IPAs called
Hopsidian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, back to the drawing board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ours is Hop Onyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long and how long before a New York
brewery can expect to be profitable if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you when we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: People ask me all the time, is your
brewery doing well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you profitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I don't know the answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brewery could pay its bills from the
first month, which is unusual for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my wife and I haven't paid ourselves a
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're there 80 hours a week or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't get paid anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the brewery is able to pay its own
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that's profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to stop putting our own
money in, which felt good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our second year, we expanded our parking
lot, and we were able to do that with
[SPEAKER_00]: money from the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now put an addition on this event
room, and that's not our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from the brewery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to reinvest money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, there's so many different
brewery models that there's no two alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our website, which is HopShart.com,
there's a blog section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a presentation on brewery
business plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a two barrel, a seven, and a 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways breweries can make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways breweries can lose money.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't like a gold mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like any other business, depending on
what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you sell the beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the chart on what you get paid
for your beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned those really slim margins
on selling kegs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's any value in just
having kegs to get the word out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think as a brewery, you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two closest bars to us are the
Dryden Hotel and the Plantation Inn,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on 366.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have had our beer since day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been super supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're also very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just self-distribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beer goes in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haul the kegs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other places in town that have been great
are Moosewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I think Agaba still has our
stout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kilpatrick's has us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few places around town that
we also look to partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that we can sell wine, I want the
wineries that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell to also sell our beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of the reciprocal partnership
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would want to be on tap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your goal is to start a brewery and
sell kegs, you better be thinking 20
[SPEAKER_00]: barrel or bigger or bigger or bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to take a higher volume
to sell those kegs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to sell six packs,
those are super hard to get a margin on
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the cost of the container and
the bottle and everything, before you put
[SPEAKER_00]: any beer in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can only sell the six pack for so
much because the market is really flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you need to be talking way bigger,
way bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably what is Ithaca now is a 50 barrel
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably the smallest you'd
want to do if your goal was to do six
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've lost our room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to hear about beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we could do this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individually, if you guys want to ask some
more questions, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
