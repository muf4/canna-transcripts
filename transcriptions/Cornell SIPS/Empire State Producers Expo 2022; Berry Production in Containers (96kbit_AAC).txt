[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are commercially available and a
small colony that needs to be redeployed
[SPEAKER_00]: every six to eight weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could also use mechanical
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the small scale of research that we
have at Cornell, it wasn't practical for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to obtain bumblebees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually used a leaf blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a battery operated leaf blower
that was not very powerful and we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: throttled it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once a day we would move through
the crop and try to carefully blow the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower clusters to mechanically pollinate
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was decently effective but we would
periodically see misshapen fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: indicating that there was poor pollination
of our flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these rows are typically spaced about
three feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes slightly tighter spacing,
2.6 to 3.3 feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would give us a plant
density of, so if this slab is about three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet long or a meter long and they're
spaced a meter apart, we'd have anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from eight to 12 plants per square meter
or about one plant just under,
[SPEAKER_00]: just over per square foot per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the benefits of growing in
greenhouses or high tunnels would be
[SPEAKER_00]: season extension or year-round production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have reduced disease and we
certainly see this in cases where in a
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel, for example, we're protecting
our plant from rainwater that can damage
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can lead to leaf borne pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, in a greenhouse, we would have
that benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also control the relative humidity
and the airflow to reduce those foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also grow where there's poor soil
drainage in the underlying field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some really nice gains
in labor ergonomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not bending down to work in the
crop that's planted into the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the crop is at waste height or
slightly higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's easier to transplant and pick
fruit, for example, and maintain the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, because we're in an
environment where we either have some
[SPEAKER_00]: control or even more control with the
temperature and adding supplemental light
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cases, we get higher yield and
quality than outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cons that we have to think
about is it is a soil substrate production
[SPEAKER_00]: requires more precise irrigation and
fertilization practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would typically include weekly
monitoring of the root zone pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility level or electrical conductivity
periodically sending samples to like leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue samples to a lab for analysis to
make sure that our fertilizer program is
[SPEAKER_00]: on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then periodically monitoring and
adjusting the amount of irrigation water
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're supplying at each irrigation
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also requires more time and more
money for controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still see a proliferation of insects
often, so mites, thrips, and aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you also have to establish an
integrated pest management program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times in a greenhouse that
would focus on using beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: so good bugs that fight bad bugs,
as well as there are some examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: typically softer pesticides that are
registered for an edible crop in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we definitely have higher production
costs than in a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have higher output as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember there was a study from the
University of Arizona that even in an
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona greenhouse, which requires a lot
less heat and supplemental light than a
[SPEAKER_00]: New York greenhouse, they were looking at
input costs of about $4 per pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to think about how you
would differentiate your product to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher price at market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that could be the off season
production, but you would need to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: a high quality flavorful product that's
going to bring consumers out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit about cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically in high tunnels, we're looking
at using day-neutral cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit later, I'll show you some
specific examples of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we use these ever-bearing cultivars
so that we can take advantage of an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended growing season, and we would
harvest them over multiple months in the
[SPEAKER_00]: high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse or vertical farm,
we can use either day-neutral or short-day
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So day-neutral could give us several
months of harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: For short-day plants, these could be more
productive because they'll give us a large
[SPEAKER_00]: flush of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these would be plants that were
growing up ahead of time, kept in coolers
[SPEAKER_00]: until we want to force them or establish
them in the greenhouse for fruiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would have several crop cycles
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would take quite a bit of labor to
bring our plants out of the cooler,
[SPEAKER_00]: force them to fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let them fruit for a few months and
then take them out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a greenhouse, often our limiting
factor for when we can grow these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's really hard to maintain cool
enough conditions in the summertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York has different climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have high night temperatures,
so night temperatures above about,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're higher than the low 60s,
we get poorer berry production and we get
[SPEAKER_00]: poorer fruit quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fruit are not as sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with our cultivar selection,
we have to consider, again, that market
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So choosing cultivars that have good
flavor and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit about the environmental
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at day temperatures of 68
to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideal night temperatures are quite cool,
50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lower temperatures give us larger
fruit size and better flavor and sweetness
[SPEAKER_00]: of berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then above 60 to 65 leads to higher
acidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get more acidic fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The optimum light that we would get is
fairly moderate kind of sunlight
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we talk about light in moles per
meter squared per day, we'd be in between
[SPEAKER_00]: a lettuce plant and a tomato plant,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lettuce would have about 15 moles of
light per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes would have about 30 moles of
light per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would want 20 to 25,
which means in the wintertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we want good output from our crop,
we would definitely have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, many greenhouse growers in the
wintertime would enrich with carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide to make, to improve crop
productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 feeds into photosynthesis and that
improves our crop yield by maybe 20 to 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then humidity's 40 to 60% during the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the night, we actually
want to have high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll explain that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three hours at 95% humidity at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a typical greenhouse production
schedule would have us say transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: well-developed tray plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants that were previously propagated
about two to two and a half months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're transplanted, flowering begins in
September through October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're harvesting our plants
November through May with the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: ending when temperatures get too warm in
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the bottlenecks that I'm
hearing about from greenhouse strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: growers is it's hard to source good tray
plants from propagators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many growers will do their own
propagation in the summertime where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll take runner tips and root them and
then grow them on in 125 to 250 milliliter
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few photos from greenhouse
strawberry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants that are getting
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the plastic is used to help
prevent weeds that could proliferate in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soilless substrate as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could help with some insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like thrips, for example, or fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thrips are on the leaves, but then they
actually pupate in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they drop down and pupate in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could help restrict them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a view of this greenhouse did not
have supplemental lighting, but they did
[SPEAKER_00]: have photo periodic lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to trick the plant into thinking that
it's getting long days, which helps with
[SPEAKER_00]: initiating more flowers and more fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually had these these LED lights
that have some far red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would be operated four hours per
day during the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's plants that are coming into
fruiting and being actively harvested at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Japan, their market's quite
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These berries were selling for about a
dollar per berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every berry was high quality and kind
of packed individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about yields for for field
production in California, we get about
[SPEAKER_00]: sixty thousand pounds per acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they have this would be day
neutral strawberry production over several
[SPEAKER_00]: months per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives us about one point four
pounds of fruit per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our New York field production is seasonal
and then much lower yields of five
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand to twenty thousand pounds per
acre per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are reports that high tunnel
tabletop yields can be double outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that would be like double New
York style yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the greenhouse, we can get maybe
two to two point six pounds of fruit per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high tech greenhouse in the Netherlands
that would be operating year round could
[SPEAKER_00]: get up to four point five pounds of fruit
per square foot per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end, quite high yields,
maybe about three times times the
[SPEAKER_00]: California yields and nine times more than
New York field yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a bit about a couple of common
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned that we need to maintain
high humidity for a few hours at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is to avoid strawberry tip burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry tip burn is a calcium
deficiency that's kind of akin to lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: tip burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the developing tissues,
the leaves and the and the bracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks before the symptoms show up,
like this picture on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was there was poor calcium supply to
the developing tissues and calcium supply
[SPEAKER_00]: in strawberries relies a lot on having
positive root pressure at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever seen gotation on
strawberries, maybe in your outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries in the morning where there's
there's actually water leaking through the
[SPEAKER_00]: vessels on the out of the out or edges of
the leaf, that's showing us that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: positive root pressure at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of water being pulled through
through transpiration, a positive root
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure built up and and water was pushed
through the plant to deliver calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so for strawberries, that's that's
a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need that that to help deliver calcium
to the plant to avoid tip burn,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can impair our leaf productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also make fruit unsightly if the if
the sepals have this tip burn as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So common pests and diseases are aphids,
spider mites and thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are thrips feeding in the flowers,
which they love feeding on pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common diseases would be powdery mildew
and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's here's botrytis,
for example, gray mold that's on that's on
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the control mechanisms that we have
there is to remove any decaying tissue or
[SPEAKER_00]: dying tissue, including any like over
mature fruit that was not previously
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Cornell, one of our earlier greenhouse
research projects was to screen a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars of strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were all day neutral
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eldian, Cabrillo, Seascape and Portola
were used in the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at the bricks or the sugar
content of berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked at at yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was over a six month period in
the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eldian gave us our lowest yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could actually get almost twice the
yields with cultivars, Cabrillo and 50
[SPEAKER_00]: percent higher yields with Portola.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that we found and is
well known with Eldian is it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's still one of the Eldian would
be probably the most common greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry varieties that are used because
of its sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to think about that market
differentiation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we double our yield but have a less
sweet berry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would the consumer be OK with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll conclude with just a couple of
trends that we're seeing for C.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two thirds of the strawberry production
area in the UK is in soilless substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's largely moved away from from field
soils because of the control that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 815 acres of strawberry production
under glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so a large share of their crop in North
America and the US, we're just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see increased interest in greenhouse
strawberry production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New York, we have Green Empire Farms,
which is 32 acres of greenhouse strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we have 90 acres of
tabletop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be outdoors, but in soilless
substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Canada, we have a couple of large
farms now with with greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're seeing vertical farms,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought this was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oishi is a vertical farm company based out
of New Jersey, and they show they sell
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries to high end markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This this box with 11 strawberries
actually sells for fifty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine paid five dollars per
strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are really captivated by this
fruit and they'll still sell them to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of top restaurants and high end consumers
that maybe want to impress their loved one
[SPEAKER_00]: with with very tasty strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's something we could aspire
to as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we could do it for much,
much cheaper in a greenhouse or high
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I will stop and I think I've
used up any time I had for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy to sit and monitor the chat
and I'll be responding during the session
[SPEAKER_00]: this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving right along, our next presenter
is Kathy Demchak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you know Kathy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is been a longtime supporter of berry
production, research and extension efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a senior extension associate at the
Penn State University, where her
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibilities are to conduct applied
research into technologies that improve
[SPEAKER_01]: the sustainability of berry production
with the overall goal of reducing negative
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impacts of production while
maximizing crop productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kathy, if you want to share your screen
and take it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so so we've been doing some work in
containerized production of strawberries
[SPEAKER_03]: and and raspberries for for a few few
years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had been dabbling with it earlier,
so I'm going to give a little history and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk a little bit about where we've ended
up in what conclusions we have so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then primarily concentrate on some of
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even though, you know, as Neil
mentioned, a lot of the work seems to be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, increasing recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these are some systems,
different solar systems that growers have
[SPEAKER_03]: been trying off and on for for over 20
years now in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's gone OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes there have been, you know,
they've given up and moved on.
[SPEAKER_03]: To other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's something called the Ibex
growing system that some folks are trying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's a lot like some of the other
other systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, there are gutters
that people have tried over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had some growers try like Seascape
and Merodebois.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but over this time, as this has been
happening, it was a small percentage of
[SPEAKER_03]: the production, but a lot of the questions
I was getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, just my point in all of
this is that, you know, I'm glad we're
[SPEAKER_03]: working out some of these things,
maybe because there does seem to be a long
[SPEAKER_03]: term need for info looking both backwards
and forwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to credit some of the work that
it happened to before I started working on
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There used to be some information in the
Enraged Strawberry Guide back in 1998
[SPEAKER_03]: about greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell had done some work on greenhouse
raspberry production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of this earlier work that was
done really laid the groundwork for us to
[SPEAKER_03]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over on the left, you see a photo of a
young Fumi Takeda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Fumi had retired at the end of,
towards the end of last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over on the right are some
gutters we had had back in 2003 and 2004
[SPEAKER_03]: in our Penn State High Tunnel Complex,
which the Lamont and Mike Gorzelik had
[SPEAKER_03]: been very instrumental in getting going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank all those folks for
their help over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So more recently, there has been,
you know, the greenhouse interest,
[SPEAKER_03]: the controlled environment interest with
Dr. Takeda, now out at Ohio State,
[SPEAKER_03]: formerly Arizona, the information Neil had
presented.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as he mentioned, commercial
operations are increasing or beginning to
[SPEAKER_03]: increase in number and size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil had mentioned some of the protected
culture advantages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't really need to go over
those so much, but I do want to point out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one that growers had mentioned
that is part of the better quality is just
[SPEAKER_03]: the more attractive appearance of the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we know, you know, consumers,
as folks will say, buy with their eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having those nice looking berries
is important for marketability.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that growers have
mentioned to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then regarding labor, there is the
improved ergonomics if you have the system
[SPEAKER_03]: up off of the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing is that if you have
folks working for you, there is the
[SPEAKER_03]: predictability of when they can work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even if you're working in high
tunnels, it doesn't matter if it's a rainy
[SPEAKER_03]: day, you can still plan on harvesting on a
schedule or whatever you want to do in
[SPEAKER_03]: that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we got into this in a bigger
way was there was a multi-state SCRI
[SPEAKER_03]: project looking at plastic covers on high
tunnels, for high tunnels that was led by
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric Hanson out at Michigan State.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cornell was a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks in New Hampshire and Vermont and
also some other states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some collaborators in the UK who
were a big help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a part where we were looking at
the different plastic covers on the
[SPEAKER_03]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem was we had a lot of
variation in soil between the tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bearing and pH and nutrient
concentration or content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we wanted to get away from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were also growing both raspberries
and strawberries as part of the research
[SPEAKER_03]: we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we decided we needed to move to
containers, but we also needed to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: the same irrigation set up for both crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had to find a system that we
could use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also that students who were working with
us could help with unfairly, with only a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit of training or that we felt
would function well over a weekend without
[SPEAKER_03]: running into problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we were going for about the most
low tech system we could possibly go for
[SPEAKER_03]: while still growing in a soil-less media
in containers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now for some reason, my screen does
not want to advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is an interesting little
predicament to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kathy, did you try the regular advance?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the little ones down in the
left-hand corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes if you do your own,
your little forward arrows, none of that
[SPEAKER_03]: is doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, those are not showing up at the
bottom, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might have to escape out of this and
get back to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never had this happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me just see if I can,
I'm going to just start sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm still sharing, but I'm going to
just try advancing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm just stuck on that one and see
if we can go forward from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, well, we'll try something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so we had to figure this system
out pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, that expression
necessity is the mother of invention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we basically, you know, we talked to a
lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked to Eric out at Michigan State
and, you know, took a look at the work
[SPEAKER_03]: other folks had done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we did a quick winter trial to
try out some different things where we
[SPEAKER_03]: basically just tried a whole bunch of
stuff over a winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did find something that would work
fairly well for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this was, which we're not really,
you know, wholesale recommending right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, but it worked well in our situation
was a two to one peak per light mix that
[SPEAKER_03]: we had to mix ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not have lime added to it because
we have high bicarbonate waters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't want to get into having to
acidify the water source with the setup we
[SPEAKER_03]: had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fortunately, this seemed to work
fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see our raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the variety polka in the front and
Josephine in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: These were actually two separate trials
that were happening at this particular
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down in the right, you see one of
our tunnels where we had Albion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet Ann, Cabrillo, and San Andreas
growing, you can see right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, so we worked out something
enough for that trial to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're continuing to look at some
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we're just trying to find a way
of growing the plants that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost anybody could adopt who has a high
tunnel and doesn't have a real strong
[SPEAKER_03]: background in greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so we tried some things out
last year where we knew we were doing
[SPEAKER_03]: things the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And long story short, we figured out all
sorts of ways to make iron deficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my approach is sometimes that I
need to make mistakes before I can figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out how to fix them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's where we were on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, so we're still working it all
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of potential, I think,
with strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are interactions between
the media type you're using, the water
[SPEAKER_03]: source and the fertilizer you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to work some of that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our conclusion we're coming to is it
probably isn't like a one size fits all
[SPEAKER_03]: approach that will work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there may be some ways of doing this
that, you know, say if you're in a
[SPEAKER_03]: situation with a high bicarbonate water,
then you do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if you're not, then you do something
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're still working that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the overall keys I think we've
come up with, which I think everybody else
[SPEAKER_03]: would agree with, is that you do need a
lower pH media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, talking down in the range of
mid fives to maybe six seems to help out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a high bicarbonate water,
acidifying the water source, or you start
[SPEAKER_03]: out with good water quality, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Micronutrients can be an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we kind of found that raspberries
were a relative breeze compared to
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to keep working on all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to just throw up this quote.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what Laura had said that today's
talk would be about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to spend the rest of the
talk talking about some of the pests we've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen in our trials and what we've done to
manage those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil had already mentioned most of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a great introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the pest issues we do see are quite a
bit different than what we see in the
[SPEAKER_03]: field.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's obviously no rain or overhead
irrigation when you're in a tunnel or a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means we don't have some of the
rain splash diseases like anthracnose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have actually seen very little gray
mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be because in our trials,
we've kept things very cleanly picked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we haven't really seen those issues
so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some on raspberries, but not on the
strawberries so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we see more of the problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are ones that rainfall helps to
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the ones that rainfall does help to
control become worse in a tunnel or in a
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So powdery mildew, a lot of the smaller
insect pests, which we think of as
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the aphids, mites, thrips, all those
sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do just want to mention, too,
that when you do get into pest issues,
[SPEAKER_03]: the materials that you might use,
you need to be aware of the fact that the
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides will need to be labeled for
either greenhouse production, or it may
[SPEAKER_03]: say protected culture systems,
or protected culture production,
[SPEAKER_03]: or sometimes high tunnels are mentioned on
the label as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it works in Pennsylvania,
and I'm not sure about other states,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's defined that if the structure is
big enough that you actually get in it to
[SPEAKER_03]: work, then it counts as some sort of
protected culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the labeling has to have wording on
it that allows it to be used in that
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about some of the
diseases we see first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So powdery mildew was one we don't really
already mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that one, when you don't have rain,
you'll tend to see more issues with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least more symptoms on the fruit
because the spores can be washed off by
[SPEAKER_03]: the rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also just the environment with warm
temperatures and higher humidity are
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions that powdery mildew really
likes, so it tends to become a bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we do find, too, that our
B-neutral varieties are susceptible to
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're mostly coming out of
California now, the one that we are using,
[SPEAKER_03]: where the conditions tend to be drier and
they don't have as much resistance as some
[SPEAKER_03]: of our eastern cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seascape is one that is really
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen this on brambles in
Pennsylvania so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are some photos of seascape from
a grower tunnel where the plants were
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in a gutter system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were very packed in there pretty
tightly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we did see some issues with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also seen it on, well, seascape,
but also in a greenhouse setup that is
[SPEAKER_03]: just a small scale one in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the things that are important for
management are to increase ventilation and
[SPEAKER_03]: airflow as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may be fortunate in that on both of our
research sites, we have very windy
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we haven't seen that much in a way
of problems lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early on, we had seen some issues and we
did use a biofungicide called AQ10.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there was a trial done in New
York with Cucurbit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it seemed to work for powdery mildew
on that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was a detached leaf study
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was on actual plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only used it one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really have a lot to compare
it, anything to compare it to really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was just an observation.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our plant pathologists will say,
if you have problems, you can help wash
[SPEAKER_03]: the spores off from the leaves if you use
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to warn folks that I do know of
one grower who had used a potassium
[SPEAKER_03]: bicarbonate product.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually trying to control mites,
but potassium bicarbonate is for powdery
[SPEAKER_03]: mildew and works on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when he applied it under high
temperature conditions, the raspberries
[SPEAKER_03]: fell off of his leaves in a high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that's something that
would happen very frequently, but I just
[SPEAKER_03]: want you to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another disease we see is late leaf rust.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a systemic rust.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like you need to pull the
plants out too.
[SPEAKER_03]: To take care of the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some spruce trees are an alternate host on
this one, but once it gets on the
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries, it can persist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Historically, it's mainly been a problem
for red raspberries, but we know black
[SPEAKER_03]: raspberries can be affected too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've seen an Anjul, an Iwot in a
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly we've seen it on the leaves and it
has affected some of the fruit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it hasn't been a big enough problem
yet to worry about treating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we were in a tunnel situation,
we saw it more so out in the field though
[SPEAKER_03]: on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want to mention this is one
that hopefully you can see what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The contrast in this photo is kind of
tough, but cladosporium.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see this on raspberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two different species that cause
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it has some velvety green growth
will show up on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hopefully you can see my cursor
here, but what we're looking at is
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes it'll be on the receptacles and
some that are just hanging out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a velvety green color
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also see one fruit that we had
missed that was affected by it back here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might think that would be gray
mold, but that was actually cladosporium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes folks will see that
there are just little splotches around the
[SPEAKER_03]: rim of the raspberry, which you're not
seeing on this one here, but what it is
[SPEAKER_03]: caused by is that sometimes the anthers
get infected by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you have moist conditions and
they lay on the fruit, you get these
[SPEAKER_03]: little splotches of cladosporium around
the rim of the berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are really just on the surface,
but they still affect the marketability.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the disease itself tends to be
just on the surface and it can be rubbed
[SPEAKER_03]: off actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so that's one that we do see in
tunnels occasionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a common fungus in the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one of those things that's sort
of around and it didn't normally cause
[SPEAKER_03]: problems in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of the reason we think we might
be seeing it now is that it is associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with spotted winged drosophila and it can
be in its digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be that when spotted winged
drosophila is moving around or feeding on
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit or ovipositing, it might be
introducing it through the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be multiple avenues where that
is affecting the fact that we're seeing it
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's worst under high humidity,
tends to be worse in the fall when we have
[SPEAKER_03]: short days and reduce light and less
drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this point, we just recommend trying
to ventilate more and keeping the fruit
[SPEAKER_03]: picked and then trying to control spotted
winged drosophila as much as you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: which we will talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, so now we're going to move into the
insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with spotted winged drosophila,
we typically don't think of it as being a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge problem in the Northeast on our June
bearing strawberries because generally by
[SPEAKER_03]: the time the populations build,
we don't see very much of it and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: through the strawberry season.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with day neutrals, either in the field
or in tunnels sometimes, or with very late
[SPEAKER_03]: season June bearing cultivars,
folks will notice that there are light
[SPEAKER_03]: soft spots on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that can be mistaken for sunscald,
but if you're seeing it on the shady side
[SPEAKER_03]: of the row, it's probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they will mention that it seems to them
that the fruit is melting and then this
[SPEAKER_03]: tends to become worse in the fall because
that's when the populations built the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when that happens, you can kind of
tell yourself that it must just have been
[SPEAKER_03]: the rain in the field or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you don't want to look too
close, but one thing I've learned over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years is that looking at what you're going
to eat under a microscope is always a bad
[SPEAKER_03]: idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so what we see here in this
picture on the left, and this was taken
[SPEAKER_03]: under microscope, is a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell that the color of the fruit
is a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little pinker than a normal right
berry would be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a soft area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at it, what you see is
actually an egg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are basically breathing
tubes on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right here is where the egg is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see that under the surface of
the fruit where it has been inserted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over on the right is a larvae in
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you see are basically how it
gets its air with this little appendage up
[SPEAKER_03]: here in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can kind of see right along here
the outline of the larvae itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it goes right through here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's just something we need to be
aware of, we can have issues with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then typically spotted whale be a
bigger problem than brambles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, under the microscope,
this is a blackberry where you can see a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of eggs have been laid in these
individual droplets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right over here is an egg that you can
see just underneath the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is where the fruit is
softened and the skin was rubbed off and
[SPEAKER_03]: you see the larvae right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then generally when the spotted whale
goes through pupatation, you will see a
[SPEAKER_03]: pupa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically these will drop to the ground,
but here's one that is in a raspberry
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so adults will tend to hide
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in a tunnel where they're on the
underside of the berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were hoping with part of a trial that
maybe we could find out whether we could
[SPEAKER_03]: use a plastic that would tend to make the
population, not want to move into the
[SPEAKER_03]: tunnel so much, which we did very much see
with Japanese beetle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with spotted wing, what we found was
if we had a ultraviolet light transmitting
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic, so something like tough light
four, we did see lower adult populations,
[SPEAKER_03]: but each adult lays so many eggs that it
just didn't make any difference in the
[SPEAKER_03]: larval numbers by the time it was all said
and done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that one didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so if you had to find a solution,
it can exclude with netting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have some issues where the tunnels
will tend to get pretty warm in
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania, and so the nights will apply
faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do recommend harvesting frequently,
using good sanitation, work at the
[SPEAKER_03]: University of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show that using landscape fabric can help
so that you don't miss fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust and Pyganic are a couple of
options.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is some movement towards some
upcoming parasitoid releases, so that may
[SPEAKER_03]: be a longer term solution for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm going to talk about mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So numbers can really explode under a
tunnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two spotted spider mites, which you see on
the left, are a common one, which tend to
[SPEAKER_03]: lay a lot of eggs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we've had some issues with broad
mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to point out with them,
you need high magnification.
[SPEAKER_03]: This florescence here is really complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a symptom of broad mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is what an egg looks like
down here at the bottom, where it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a speckled-looking egg.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you need a microscope to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen issues with cyclamen mites
yet, or carmen mites, which are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: just a color variation of two-spotted
spider mite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they brought in on our three stocks,
so we could see those as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would release predators,
and they always seem to work for
[SPEAKER_03]: two-spotted spider mite unless we
refrigerated them, which I'm talking to
[SPEAKER_03]: Carol Glenister.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, no, you're supposed to keep them
cool, not cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once we stopped doing that,
that solved that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sometimes we would try to hold
them overnight or for an extra day if we
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't release them right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a no-no also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what a predatory mite looks
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see right here, moving around,
looking for mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you've released predators,
you'll need to talk to your supplier and
[SPEAKER_03]: be prepared to finish information on the
size of the area you want to treat,
[SPEAKER_03]: how big your problem is, what your
temperature and humidity ranges are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can make a recommendation for
what you can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may recommend reducing the
populations first with spring plants with
[SPEAKER_03]: water or using insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a good website also at Cornell on
biocontrols and predators that has a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of great information on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we released early, we would use a
combination of Neosulis falasis in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that gives longer-term control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd release that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd just see a few leaves that were
looking like this with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: stippling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That worked well for longer-term control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we had a really big outbreak
when we weren't paying attention,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were able to get this one under
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every plant looked like this,
but we used phytosulis persimilis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that gets really expensive when you
try to release enough mites to clean
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thrips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a thrips feeding on a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see why it causes the
bronzing, because there is surface damage
[SPEAKER_03]: that it's causing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that bronzing is a problem on
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it can cause the seeds to lift
off if the fruit surface can't expand
[SPEAKER_03]: enough because of damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Powdery mildew can cause the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you notice the seeds falling off,
you can look for one of the two of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just the fact that they're around
on raspberries is an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then aphids is another concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just an aphid population.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually on a south isle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can also see a wasp here that was
paratetocytosing some of the aphids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a parasitized one right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what worked well?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really have issues at Rock
Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there we always had a population of
lacewings and hoverflies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larvae on them are predacious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've never used pesticides in like 20
years in our high tunnel environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we think we've just built up a good
population of these beneficials.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have issues in Landisville,
which is their southeast research station.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we did there was we knocked
them back with insecticidal soap with
[SPEAKER_03]: several sprays of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we moved some potted sweet
alyssum into the tunnel to attract
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that seemed to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So typically, our growers will keep these
products on hand to try to knock things
[SPEAKER_03]: back if they need to quickly and trust in
the right place.
And then we have a lot of other products
that we've built up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got these organic and
insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's we'll mention there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do just want to say, too,
to you know, we need to keep our
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinators in mind when we're applying
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do just want to mention this is a
black raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This hole in the end of the cane is
actually a solitary B egg chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are eggs in this in this came.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like a hollow, soft center to,
you know, to to cane or piece of wood or
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not a hole made by a bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted folks to be aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like we're right at 10 o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura, do we just want to do questions in
the chat or how do you want to handle
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we take a question or two if we
have them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was something about
sputtering drosophila fly an issue during
[SPEAKER_01]: August and September in high tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does anybody else have another question
regarding pest management or just general
[SPEAKER_01]: container issues right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: So so question, how can you tell the
difference between the B egg chamber and
[SPEAKER_03]: the border hole?
[SPEAKER_03]: So so these will always be in the very tip
of the cane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I would tell folks is to cut
that cane about six or eight inches down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't go any further than
that, then it's not a bore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most, you know, our pest borers will
tunnel further down in the cane and some
[SPEAKER_03]: of them will even get into the crown area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if if it, you know, if it doesn't
go any further than that, then,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it is just a B egg chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can just let that hang out
somewhere in your tunnel there that's safe
[SPEAKER_03]: so that they can hatch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't I quickly just introduce I'm
going to share my screen as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to introduce our next
speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kathy, so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to introduce our next speaker,
which Kathy also introduced me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is Mark McDonald.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started the Beetry Berry Farm in
Belafonte, Pennsylvania in 2012 with a
[SPEAKER_01]: small plot of strawberries, which has now
grown to 20 acres of sustainably
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated berries and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good morning and thanks for having
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little background about about Laura and
myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've only been farming now for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got started a little little later in
life that a lot of folks have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent 32 years growing golf turf and
Laura spent some time working in a
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse at a farm market in York
County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have a little bit of growing
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you said, we do have 20 acres
that we planted with mixed berries and
[SPEAKER_04]: some vegetable crops, a few fruit trees
and a couple of chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our sales, they all happen at two farmers
markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a small CSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also do you pick strawberries,
blueberries and elderberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that we noticed early on when we
were first starting our first couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years growing strawberries was the just
how everyone everyone wanted them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this couldn't get enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were looking for ways to extend that
season and we went into our first day
[SPEAKER_04]: neutral third of an acre planting on
plastic in 2014, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we tried to grow on plastic for about
four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with organic inputs, it made it very
difficult to control the anthracnose
[SPEAKER_04]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Found it very hard to have a a good
harvestable crop to take to market on a
[SPEAKER_04]: weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, we actually went to see
Cathy when I think it was October,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably of 2017, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went to look at her low tunnel
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while we were there, she showed us
what was going on in the high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that really intrigued us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started the next spring with some
high tunnel production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here that our first year
we were growing in bags on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also had some raspberries in the
background there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were growing albion in one gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just a two by four frame with
some fencing on it to support the bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those bags are 12 to 14 inches on
center.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also had 30 raspberries in the back
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were grown in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, with holes, drainage holes in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything was fed with a 2720 from
Nutriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this was due to our high
alkalinity water that we had to deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our growing mix was the two to one P2
perlite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see here, this is probably our
first week of planting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically we'll get our plants the first
week of April and try to get them in the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground within 10 days of receiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll stick them on our benches,
which you can see now are now raised.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can see we're growing strictly
strawberries in this tunnel now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The raspberries are out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually divided them up and put them
out in the field a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we used the pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: The raspberries were in and raised the
benches, which was a nice aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes picking a little easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're still bent over a little bit,
but you're not crawling on the ground,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you can also, you can see now
we're growing in pots in the one gallon
[SPEAKER_04]: trade pots, as opposed to the one gallon
bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our first two years we grew in the white
bags with the black, white on black bag,
[SPEAKER_04]: and didn't like the fact that we had to
throw everything away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gone to the black pots for two
years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems to be working out okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to split it again
this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go 50 50 with the,
with the white bags to the black pots and
[SPEAKER_04]: try and get dialed in as to what really
works best for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we're still, again, we're,
this will be our fifth season and we still
[SPEAKER_04]: have a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the biggest problem that we've had
other than, than crawling along the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: to pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we've eliminated that with
raising the pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did, we have had some powering building
issues and a little bit of threat problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing major, nothing really,
really crazy, but enough to have an impact
[SPEAKER_04]: on our harvest and fertility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our, our irrigation water is, is really
not up to the standards that we'd like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we do have to really pay attention to,
to how we're feeding our harvests,
[SPEAKER_04]: our, our, I guess our first year data,
we didn't really have any, any real
[SPEAKER_04]: information on our first year harvest in
2018, 2019, we had a, a thousand and 46
[SPEAKER_04]: marketable pints.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I need to mention that we do have,
we have 700 pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were getting, that was about 732
pounds our first year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an average of 0.7 pounds per,
per pint, which is how we measure our
[SPEAKER_04]: yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we do sell by the pint.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I see a question about plant runners.
[SPEAKER_04]: We basically when they get in my way,
going down the aisles, if they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're, if I'm tripping over them,
which will happen later in the season,
[SPEAKER_04]: I remove them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do go through once and pick the first
flowers and we do one major cutting of
[SPEAKER_04]: runners early on in the season.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after that, we pretty much let them
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, unless they're, they're in our
way, then we take care of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for our second, our second year on
these raised benches and in the black
[SPEAKER_04]: pots, we changed our mix away from the,
the Pete perlite mix that had been
[SPEAKER_04]: recommended.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went with a, a, a bag mix BK 25 and
a bag mix of the same fertility programs,
[SPEAKER_04]: the same planting programs, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our yield increased from a pound per
plant to 1.3 pounds per plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, again, we're getting,
I got 1,273 marketable pipes out of this
[SPEAKER_04]: little, this little thousand square feet,
1100 square feet of growing space,
[SPEAKER_04]: which, you know, it, it's not a lot of,
of, of, of poundage, but when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at the return on investment,
we were able to get $6 a pint at market
[SPEAKER_04]: for our day neutrals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's a pretty good return
for a little over 1,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_04]: growing space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, we had a little issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we went back to peat perlite.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we harvested 155 pounds last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually turned the water off in early
September because there was no flower
[SPEAKER_04]: production mid-season on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a little bit of fruit early and
some flower production early.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the season went on, our flower
production basically stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just couldn't see the need to
continue with it last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have ordered plants again for this
year, albion again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our thoughts are to go on back with the
BK25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I want to split it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the bags versus the pots,
keep up with the same fertility program
[SPEAKER_04]: and see where it takes us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something else we're thinking about doing
this year is putting up a small
[SPEAKER_04]: caterpillar tunnel and growing day
neutrals directly in soil under plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still debating what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I
[SPEAKER_04]: can answer any questions if you have any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some questions in the chat
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you guys are,
if I'm sharing everything or what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a question from Chuck Mead
about flavor and firmness comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and tunnel versus the field
fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any comments on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Neil was saying earlier, the early
berries in the tunnel really are not up to
[SPEAKER_04]: the field flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can continue to grow in the
field a little later, maybe with malwina
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that, it'll get you into
at least a time where the tunnel berries
[SPEAKER_04]: start to pick up in flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, mid-August, you really notice a
big change in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once mid-August, September,
get there, they're probably the best
[SPEAKER_04]: berries flavor-wise that we have all
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you talked about the plant
runners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Mike Knuckles, this is actually
close to what you were just saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The harvest season, start and stopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your average starting and average
stopping in the tunnel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, we'll start, when berries are
present, we'll harvest them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start harvesting in June,
third week, fourth week of June.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've gone as far as Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends on the year, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, obviously, the yields early and
later are small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our biggest, I'm trying to see,
August and September, typically,
[SPEAKER_04]: are our best months for harvest for the
biggest yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have berries available.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken them to farmer's market till
the middle of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim has a question about changes with the
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wondering if you've settled on
something that you really like or you're
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of still experimenting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're still trying to figure that
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually did a little work with Cathy
last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was doing a media study at
Landisville.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did a few pots here as well with
the same products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, our yields last year
just didn't work out because of our
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was a core product that our
plants look good growing in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to talk, I want to get some
information, hopefully, on how their
[SPEAKER_04]: yields were down at their research farm
and go from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I think we're going to
stick with BK25 unless we see some good
[SPEAKER_04]: information coming out of their study.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we answer the last two questions,
I'm wondering if Andy or Natasha could put
[SPEAKER_01]: the link to the DEC credit survey,
which folks have to do that at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the session in order to get the DEC
credits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can keep talking about some of
these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a question about any problem
with kinking of the fruit trusses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinking of the fruit trusses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not something we've experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that has been a problem for some
people that they will sit on that edge of
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can, just because of weight of
the fruit or the sharpness of the edge,
[SPEAKER_01]: provide a little kink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of shuts off everything to
that fruit as it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, we've seen that in
some of our greenhouse strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've ended up moving to this
trough that has a smooth kind of curved
[SPEAKER_00]: edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then otherwise, I've seen some growers
run tape, not sticky tape, but like raised
[SPEAKER_00]: up a little bit so they can position the
trusses kind of resting on that soft tape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laura, can I jump in with a few things
too?
[SPEAKER_03]: So first on the fruit trusses,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So helping keep the media a little higher
can help with that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that settles into the pots,
then the trusses are up and then they're
[SPEAKER_03]: bending over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing that can help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of the reason that we are
still with bags is just they just sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: fold down.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the low yields, I was having
some conversations with Marv Pritz and
[SPEAKER_03]: also Kim Lures at Beldsville.
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, they were seeing less
flowering last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't really have that problem at
Landisville.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have no idea what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed very hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't know what was going on
there with Marks because I think we had
[SPEAKER_03]: the same plant source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was really baffling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then out of our trial at Landisville,
so what worked really well, as far as the
[SPEAKER_03]: media goes, is it's called BC5 plus
plasma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the media they're using in
Ontario and the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very different mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one worked really well for us,
better than anything else we had tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 2 to 1 P per light was really at the
bottom in that trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other ones did better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried five other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that BC5 then was the sixth one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one did the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is that with
some, we're working with folks at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Hershey School.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've actually moved to using a petunia
feed, which provides a lot more iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also another new fertilizer out of
ICO, I think it is, that has a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: iron and micronutrients and informs that
are available at higher pHs if you get
[SPEAKER_03]: into issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next year, we're going to be looking at
some of our best media with our best
[SPEAKER_03]: fertilizers and try to get a better handle
on that so we can hopefully answer these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know William has a question that
doesn't look like a very quick question,
[SPEAKER_01]: but possibly, what is your fertility
program?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say while Mark is
formulating an answer for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to encourage people,
we don't have a formal evaluation,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is my oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we're going to try to put
something together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a thought while you're
sitting here thinking about these,
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, please put topics that you
would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, if you want to see more
in-depth information on container culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: now's the time to tell us so that we can
try to follow up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Mark, I don't know if you can do that
question justice in a minute or two about
[SPEAKER_01]: the fertility program.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ours is really simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we'll start the year with the
Plant Marvel 2720.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do volume for high
alkalinity soil or water and stick with
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have an issue, I'll add a little...
Something with a little manganese and iron
[SPEAKER_04]: in it to take care of some
chlorotic-looking issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, that's pretty much it
for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to cut this short,
but we're about seven minutes over our
[SPEAKER_01]: time to adjourn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to thank our speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that growers are always
asking me about, and I'm really happy we
[SPEAKER_01]: have expertise and a grower that's willing
to share what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
