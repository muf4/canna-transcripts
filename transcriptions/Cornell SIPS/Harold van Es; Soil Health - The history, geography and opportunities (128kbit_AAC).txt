[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Tim, for that extensive
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will not be talking about ADAPTEN
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be talking about soil health,
which is another very exciting topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to try to focus on sort of
bigger picture issues, because I believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that we need to understand that in order
to be able to think about how we can sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of address some of the current issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a quick introduction,
and we've talked about soil health in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past, so I'm not going to go down too far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it basically relates to functioning of
the soil, the capacity to function.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like with human health,
it's an equivalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of these functions include
supporting plant growth and thereby crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is being an excellent habitat
for organisms, being a hydrological and
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental buffer, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I often like to start out with this
diagram that sort of shows how we as
[SPEAKER_03]: humans are impacted by soil health through
maybe two major pathways.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is sort of the agriculture and
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other one is more the ecosystem
services and the environmental impacts
[SPEAKER_03]: issues like climate change or water
quality, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I want to explore a little bit more
how we as humans are also impacting soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health, so the arrow going the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing that's been really
exciting about soil health, and we started
[SPEAKER_03]: a major effort here at Cornell with
Georgia Bowie and Dave Wolf about 18 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it brought together is the three
major supporting disciplines in soil
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so ended up working with soil
chemists, worked with Murray McBride and
[SPEAKER_03]: Hannah and people like that with Janice
Tease and now Dan Buckley, Dave Wolf and
[SPEAKER_03]: George Bowie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really come out of the physical
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the ideas initially was to say,
well, we really did a very good job with
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and pH or the chemical aspects,
but the physical and biological aspects
[SPEAKER_03]: are not very well addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that brought us to developing a soil
health test, basically, sort of a standard
[SPEAKER_03]: test that's made up of chemical,
physical, and biological.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these were selected based on their
general utility cost and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're now in the soil health lab in
this building.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now processing several thousands of
samples annually from basically all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has sort of become one of the
standards for soil health assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've tweaked it a little bit over the
years, but they've largely held up as
[SPEAKER_03]: being really good indicators, and I'll
show you some results later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to start at a very foundational
level first, and that's really what soils
[SPEAKER_03]: made up, what makes up soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's really a few very basic
ingredients that make soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is the minerals, typically
weathered geological material,
[SPEAKER_03]: biological material, and then water,
air and sun as the other major
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that basically the water dissolves the
mineral, the crystals, and dissolves the
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals, makes nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of those nutrients are biologically
hydrogen normally derived.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need water, air, and sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need water to grow plants and to have
the plants to feed other organisms,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's sort of what on earth,
at least, makes the soils very special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we end up with this sort of
accumulation of carbon and minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the natural soil formation,
this is really a very efficient system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the minerals that are being
dissolved by chemical weathering are being
[SPEAKER_03]: absorbed through roots by plants and then
feed other organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the minerals dissolved end up
actually in some type of organic material
[SPEAKER_03]: if they're not being absorbed by the soil,
but very low loss rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the organics, the carbon, either builds
up in the soil, especially here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see that in the forest-derived soil,
or they're being recycled, either directly
[SPEAKER_03]: plant material being recycled or recycled
through some other organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in natural system, you basically have
an accumulation over time of minerals and
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon in the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sort of creates a, you might say,
a bank account of stored energy and
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an example of a highly successful type
of soil health formation are these
[SPEAKER_03]: periglacial lost soils under grassland
vegetation, which you find in sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's now most of the Corn Belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost soils are wind-derived, very fresh
material from recent glaciation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grassland soils are very efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get these very deep mollusks that
are really fantastic, a success story in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of soil health formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And around the world, we have a lot of
similar soils like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the soils here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think of Iowa and places like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But China and Ukraine, Central Europe,
even in South America, you have a lot of
similar soils like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have similar soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe me, a lot of wars have been
fought over controlling those kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: lands because they are the most productive
soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at, so this accumulation of
minerals and carbon, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here, the carbon is organic sea,
and the minerals, I just show the
[SPEAKER_03]: phosphorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are five soils in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a relatively old publication.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to do some back of the envelope
calculations of what does this really
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in those soils?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's about 3,000 kilograms of
phosphorous per hectare in the top foot of
[SPEAKER_03]: those soils in terms of phosphorous that's
either in organic form or some other
[SPEAKER_03]: non-crystalline-absorbed form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for the entire root zone,
that may be about double that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you think of a corn, a seasonal
corn plant requires about 40 to 50
[SPEAKER_03]: kilograms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of think about this being a
bank of minerals that you can draw out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have a good 100 years,
maybe, that you could draw out of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that we necessarily want to do that,
but it's there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why these soils are productive
and have been relatively productive for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as opposed to those soils, we also have
what we might call marginally successful
[SPEAKER_03]: soil health formation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is a Cecil soil from the
Southeast in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the minerals have already been
leached out because these are old soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: The remaining minerals are a lot of iron
and aluminum oxides.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're forest-derived, so not that much
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, a lot of it has been lost through
erosion and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a not-so-good soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can map that, and you look at a
picture like that, and you see,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, you see that most of these soils
that have a lot of phosphorous tend to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in these periglacial, more northern areas
where there's more organic matter in the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and much poorer in the southern areas
with the exception of the Mississippi
[SPEAKER_03]: River Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, that's the good stuff that
comes down the river, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll come back to that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this, of course, you can upscale
that to a global level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tend to be blessed with very good soils
in this part of the world and most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the world has soils more like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some soils from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so not a lot of useful nutrients,
relatively low organic matter content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when you have a situation where
you can maybe get a couple of years of
[SPEAKER_03]: crop production out of them, and then you
have to abandon the land, which kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulated this whole idea of shifting
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, three years of crops, 30,
40 years of putting it back and letting
[SPEAKER_03]: the natural soil forming processes build a
little bit of fertility, and then you have
[SPEAKER_03]: another two or three years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very different than the situation
in, say, the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we started to develop these
soils, agricultural development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we removed the surface vegetation,
so that's some of the carbon, but then
[SPEAKER_03]: also, of course, we till the soil,
we stimulate organic matter decomposition,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great because it releases the
nutrients, but it's not so great because
[SPEAKER_03]: you're basically drawing out of your bank
account, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in addition, we have this physical
degradation of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so erosion and all that, so not only
are you kind of burning up the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter and using the nutrients,
some of them are actually physically
[SPEAKER_03]: removed off your field and goes elsewhere,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is much more of a problem in
hotter climates or forest-derived soils
[SPEAKER_03]: that basically aren't that good to start
out with, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And these soils, because we're growing
plants, typically when we're growing
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, a lot of times it's annual plants,
and so for a large part of the year,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no active plant growth,
and the soil forming processes are not
[SPEAKER_03]: that efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, we're not using the basic
resources of water, sun, and minerals as
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiently, and we have a lot more
losses, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Much of the minerals and energy because of
agriculture, we remove them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We typically harvest 50 to 60% of the
biomass and even more of the minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're recycling a little bit through
residues or maybe manures, but a lot of it
[SPEAKER_03]: gets lost, and so we're effectively mining
these soils, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what agriculture has done,
and it's results in nutrient and carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: depletion, and like I said, basically the
need for discontinuous production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's some data from Kirsten Kurtz,
and many of you know her.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: She manages the Soil Health Lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's also working on a master's program
with Rebecca Snyder and Steve Moriale,
[SPEAKER_03]: her minor advisor, and what she has done
is sampled some soils, natural soils as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as possible, prairie soils in the
western Corn Belt, and then sampling,
[SPEAKER_03]: co-sampling at agricultural sites that
were right nearby, kind of a site-by-site
[SPEAKER_03]: comparison, and this is some very
preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's doing a lot of soil health analyses.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is organic matter, and it shows how
much loss of organic matter there's been
[SPEAKER_03]: in an area that's been in production maybe
for less than 150 years, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So often, you know, two, three,
four percent organic matter losses,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this project is in the context of some
work in China that Rebecca and Steve
[SPEAKER_03]: started in an area in northwestern China
where we, in a way, have a similar
[SPEAKER_03]: ecological, agroecological environment,
but many more years of intensive land
[SPEAKER_03]: degradation that's really quite extreme
and dustball-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that brings me to this issue of
the geography and the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of my thinking started a few years
ago when Aubrey Fine, who got her master's
[SPEAKER_03]: degree with Anita Martinez and then worked
for me for a year or two or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so Aubrey's a very, very smart lady,
and so I asked her to do some statistical
[SPEAKER_03]: analysis, so she did some multivariate
work and all that, but I also asked her to
[SPEAKER_03]: do a regional comparison of the soils in
our soil health database from the many
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of samples that we had analyzed
and compare those three regions,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic,
and the Northeast, and so based on what I
[SPEAKER_03]: just said about soil development and why
some soils are better than others,
[SPEAKER_03]: and other ones, which one would you expect
to have the best results in terms of soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you would say, yeah,
these periglacial mollisols.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, it's good I didn't bet any
money on that because it turned out to be
[SPEAKER_03]: not the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is here, these are four
physical indicators, agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: agri-stability, available water capacity,
and penetration resistance is a hardness
[SPEAKER_03]: indicator, and four biological indicators,
organic matter, active carbon,
[SPEAKER_03]: protein, and respiration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So organic matter is a standard indicator,
active carbon, something that we worked on
[SPEAKER_03]: with Dave Wolf, is a labile carbon
indicator, protein, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: is protein, work with Janice Teese on
that, and then respiration as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so what you see, so where it's green,
it means that that region has
[SPEAKER_03]: statistically higher or more favorable
numbers, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see that the Northeast and the
Mid-Atlantic tended to have the best
[SPEAKER_03]: physical and biological conditions,
better than the Midwest, the only one that
[SPEAKER_03]: was good in the Midwest was available
water capacity, which has more to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: the dominant textural class, which is more
silt loam and silty clay loam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is surprising, you look at organic
matter, the Midwest had about 3%,
[SPEAKER_03]: and along the East Coast had about 4%,
that's 1% difference in organic matter,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a lot, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The protein content was about double along
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really surprising, so why is
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you have that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because conventional theory says it should
be much better, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So but when you think about this,
now these were just samples that came into
[SPEAKER_03]: our lab, so not a stratified sampling
scheme or whatever, just whatever came.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you think about it, what comes
into a lab from the Midwest is associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with corn and soybean row crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: What comes into our lab from the East
Coast is more livestock, more perennial
[SPEAKER_03]: crops like alfalfa, more organic farms,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is definitely surprising that
soil health is basically better along the
[SPEAKER_03]: East Coast than in the central part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really kind of brought me to think
about the spatial dimension of soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tend to think of soil health and
soil farming factors as something that
[SPEAKER_03]: happens in situ, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But as it turns out, there's a huge
spatial dimension to that, and that's both
[SPEAKER_03]: natural and anthropogenic processes,
and we're gonna explore those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically what it means is that there's
areas of convergence where the basic soil
[SPEAKER_03]: health resources, which is primarily
carbon and minerals, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: are coming together in some area,
but they're being lost in an area of
[SPEAKER_03]: divergence, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we think about historically,
where are the areas where crop domestic
[SPEAKER_03]: investigation occurred and we have had
long and sustained food supplies,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would basically come up with this
list, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that from our introductory
agronomy courses and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the areas where we had millennia
of population growth and increased food
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is that possible if we only have a
limited bank of carbon and minerals,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do these areas have in common,
you might ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did ask that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, these areas are what we might call
hydro, bio, geochemical convergence areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really exploiting the dictionary of
the Greek language here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water, bio, life, and then geochemical,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are areas in a larger
geographic region, a catchment,
[SPEAKER_03]: where these resources come together
through natural processes, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Water and whatever comes with water,
what's dissolved in it, either coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: the surface or subsurface, ends up
converging in streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: These streams converge into rivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: These rivers have floodplains and deltas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where some of this material gets
deposited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sediment, the carbon, the minerals
that comes with that are all being
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrated in a relatively small area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the health of the soil in
that area would then be more much more
[SPEAKER_03]: favorable than what the areas where it's
being lost, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about an erosional process even
under natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's at the surface is the best part of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that gets lost and you concentrate
it somewhere else, that's very favorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you look at descriptions of carbon
and nitrogen profiles of these degrading
[SPEAKER_03]: soils that are on the receiving end of
this, they have very favorable properties,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes, they're also physically very
favorable because they tend to be silty
[SPEAKER_03]: type material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one example of that is, of course,
is the lower Nile Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the history of that millennia of
cultures and population growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the catchment of the Nile really goes
from the Mediterranean all the way down to
[SPEAKER_03]: East Central Africa on the White Nile and
Northeast Africa on the Blue Nile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so basically, the resources that come
from that gigantic catchment end up really
[SPEAKER_03]: all concentrating in the lower Nile
Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the water, you get the carbon,
you get the minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have that in an area that's
otherwise an extreme desert, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have this localized area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know from history, even from
scriptures and all that, what went on
[SPEAKER_03]: there in that lower Nile Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So millennia of sustained populations,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So gradient soils, continuous mineral and
organic matter additions, food surpluses
[SPEAKER_03]: that developed, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you kind of figured out how to use
certain plants to make crops out of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: they used emmer, wheat, and all that,
that allowed you then for trade
[SPEAKER_03]: specialization, administrative
hierarchies, armies, art, you name it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course, slavery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture has a very ugly history with
slavery.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you think about if you bring in slaves
from other areas, you also need to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to feed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to have a pretty good food
surplus to be able to say, we're bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: in other people and we're gonna make them
do the work so that we don't have to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we feed them, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really a great part of our history,
but it is always facilitated by the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that you had the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: You create food, not withstanding the fact
that there were famines, there were past
[SPEAKER_03]: problems, things like that, in part
related to climate fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another interesting example is the Valley
of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in central Mexico, there is a basin and
there used to be a lake there that is in a
[SPEAKER_03]: volcanic region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now volcanic areas have naturally very
fertile soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, mafic rock material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a geological basin,
so it doesn't drain to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have a convergence there of
mineral resources that in this case came
[SPEAKER_03]: to a very large lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that, you then had the
development of these organic soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the minerals fed the crop, the
production of marsh plants, which then
[SPEAKER_03]: build up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, you have a huge bank
account.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of minerals that were developed over the
millennia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this area is no longer a lake and it's
one of the largest cities in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Mexico City, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been drained now, but naturally
in the earlier years, this was the center
[SPEAKER_03]: of not only crop production, but of a very
high civilization, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an impression of what the city of
Mexico Tenochtitlan would have looked like
[SPEAKER_03]: right in the lake, the pyramids and all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically the population was fed from
the marshes from this area, which we refer
[SPEAKER_03]: to as the Chinampas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have marsh land and you want to
put it in production, so you have this
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful rich soil full of organic matter
and minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only problem is you can't grow many of
the crops because you have water logging.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You dig canals and you take the soil out
of one area and you heap it up in another
[SPEAKER_03]: area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you mineralize that organic matter
because you oxidize it now and you have
[SPEAKER_03]: the most productive soil you could ever
imagine, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: But because these were marsh areas,
there was this tremendous bank of carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: energy and mineral resources that went
with that, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sort of got some of the early
crop domestication going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maize bean, squash, you know that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several large cities, not only
Tenochtitlan, but also Teotihuacan,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you can now visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still it's a beautiful site.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't been there, put the
pyramids there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tenochtitlan is now downtown Mexico City.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like one little ruin left of that,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as an aside, of course, the indigenous
population there, the Mexicas,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are part of the Aztecs, were no-till
farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have any draft animals or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they used planting sticks and they
didn't really do any tillage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were way ahead of our time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, when the conquerors came,
they said to the indigenous population,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing it all wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to till the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they said, well, we don't have
any draft animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a beautiful mural by Diego Rivera
at the Palacio Nacional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a place to visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it shows, again, this story,
the human factor around agriculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: how that interrelates with the natural
resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a number of other
biogeochemical convergence zones that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think are notable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is Mesopotamia, of course,
where the source of the water and the
[SPEAKER_03]: biogeochemical material is primarily from
Turkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Indo-Gangetic Plain, right next to the
orographically most active region in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Constant supply of fresh minerals and
carbon coming out of the mountains into
[SPEAKER_03]: the Gangetic Plain here and the Indus over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the North China Plain and the
Yangtze River Delta very similarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So North China Plain is the Yellow River
estuary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these areas were continuously
flooded, linear supply of minerals and
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon that came from the upper areas of
the catchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these areas became highly populated
because there was the opportunity for high
[SPEAKER_03]: food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another interesting example is the country
of Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Japan is a very mountainous country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly volcanic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have earthquakes all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just had one two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have relatively limited areas
here where you have these biogeochemical
[SPEAKER_03]: convergence areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are flood plains or coastal plains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the country is very
mountainous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can't really grow any crops
there, except in maybe some tiny little
[SPEAKER_03]: valleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the land that can produce crops
is very intensively used.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a corn belt or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, these are biogeochemical
convergence zones and they allow for very
[SPEAKER_03]: intensive crop production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming back home, we have that here in
New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our best soils here in New York are in
places like the Genesee Valley or the
[SPEAKER_03]: Schoharie Valley or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are floodplain soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: They derive the resources from the entire
catchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of our best soils are in the
Genesee Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can compete with any soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Iowa or any other place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eel, Genesee, Hamelin, these are the soils
that are the best in the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is happening to these ancient
biogeochemical conversion zones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we look at the cities that I'm
listing here that are now in these highly
[SPEAKER_03]: priced agricultural areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've become very densely populated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rivers have been channelized,
so there's no more natural flooding
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flooding is terrible for the humans,
but it was good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Oswan Dam was built here, so the whole
idea of what happened to the lower Nile
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley that's out now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Russians built that in the 1960s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still very intensive crop production,
now based on synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the worst soil health
degradation you might imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see now in these areas that were
naturally highly productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we talked about biogeochemical
convergence, but us humans also have a big
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might call it anthropogenic
biogeochemical concentration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one very interesting example of that
is if you go to Northwestern Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: not too far from where I grew up,
and you see these heath areas with heath
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting because heath is a
pioneer species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this area was glaciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so about 10,000 years ago,
there's an opportunity for the invasion of
[SPEAKER_03]: various species.
[SPEAKER_03]: So heath is one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these soils in most of these areas are
very poor, very sandy, maybe more rain,
[SPEAKER_03]: outwash, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of them are pot soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very low, low inherent fertility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are these areas in the
landscape, typically around some kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: settlement, maybe a sheep barn or
farmhouse, where you have these fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: soils, or deep organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's maybe initially somewhat
puzzling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we call these soils plug-in soils,
or in Germany, plug-in ash soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a plug-in is really kind of like
cutting a sod.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that word means.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's happening there is that,
so first of all, it's somewhat surprising
[SPEAKER_03]: that you still have heath vegetation when
it's a pioneer species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been taken over by trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what the farmers did in that area,
they concentrated the resources from a
[SPEAKER_03]: large area around their own farmstead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the heath.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would cut the sod, maybe let's say 10
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a full of dense roots and a little
bit of soil material.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would bring that to the farmstead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, they used it as bedding in
the sheep barns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had a lot of sheep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the sheep, of course, would be grazing
all over the place in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would be eating the vegetation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sheep actually eat heath OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, at night,
you have to protect the sheep from the
[SPEAKER_03]: wolves and the foxes and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring them into the holding pen,
the sheep barn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had the heath sod, the plug-in,
as the bedding material.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sheep are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do at night?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the things that they do is
they defecate and they urinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've got this nice mixture of a
sort of composted material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mix it with some of the ash and maybe
char.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you deposit that onto the soils
around the farmstead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you had a very productive area
around the farmstead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was basically the mining of resources
from a much larger area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of the same idea,
this biogeochemical convergence into a
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just human ingenuity to create
this system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that there's other examples of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you are familiar with the terra
preta, the Indio soils, because Johannes
[SPEAKER_03]: Lehmann and his lab team have done a lot
of work on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a very interesting paper called
the paper that just came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually it's 2019 officially.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just only available online that
compares these soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the terra preta in Brazil,
it's more the char that seems to be
[SPEAKER_03]: providing some stabilization with the
plug-in soils.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more the fact that they are in a more
temperate climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the organic matter decomposition is
lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But throughout history, there are these
examples because the terra preta soils are
[SPEAKER_03]: also basically an example where people
took resources from a larger area in the
[SPEAKER_03]: forest in this particular case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they brought them into a smaller
area where they were able to concentrate
[SPEAKER_03]: those resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm talking about biogeochemical
convergence and gain areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, there are also loss areas,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the areas in the catchment
that do not benefit from having carbon and
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals coming from other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the areas that are subject to
erosion and leaching of these minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are much more fragile areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now know that it's very difficult
to sustain crop production unless you
[SPEAKER_03]: start out with a fabulously naturally
fertile soil like the Mollusk soils in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's another pattern that has
occurred over the past years, past
[SPEAKER_03]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_03]: In early agriculture, we had a strong
integration of crops, primary producers,
[SPEAKER_03]: animals, the primary consumers,
and humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: They lived all in the same area,
typically on the same farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw with urbanization, we saw a
separation of the crops and the animals
[SPEAKER_03]: from the humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the minerals and the carbon
did not get fully recycled, but most of
[SPEAKER_03]: them did get cycled around on a farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with the commodification, good term,
by the way, Peter, I like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: of agriculture, we've had a separation,
increasing separation of the crops,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the animals, from the humans,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, from a biogeochemical
perspective, creates some challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now we have these concentrated
livestock areas in this country,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are in one right now, or right
here, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Central and Western New York are an
epicenter for the dairy production,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of the supplemental grains that
come out of the Midwest that are being fed
[SPEAKER_03]: to these animals means that there's a
surplus of carbon and minerals in these
[SPEAKER_03]: areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, Idaho, California, Delmarva
Peninsula, poultry, Northwest Arkansas,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then Eastern Carolina and Virginia for
hogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are areas where there's a lot more
animals than would normally be fed by the
[SPEAKER_03]: surrounding areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what we have is a flow of
minerals and carbon from the central crop
[SPEAKER_03]: production area in the country to these
primary livestock producing areas,
[SPEAKER_03]: including upstate New York, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Through these crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you think of corn and soybean,
think of biogeochemical material,
[SPEAKER_03]: think of soil health, because these are
the materials that are fed to the animals
[SPEAKER_03]: and then come out the other end and are
being used to improve the quality of the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, we know from our agronomy
history and soil science history that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've had some technological developments
over the past couple hundred years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Von Liebig laws, Haber and Bosch,
and the industrial capacity after World
[SPEAKER_03]: War II where we now basically use
synthetic minerals to kind of resupply the
[SPEAKER_03]: losses that come from the soil,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we hadn't done this, we would have
really run out of minerals, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically that's what this map shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're now, the major loss of minerals
and carbon is from the central crop
[SPEAKER_03]: production area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're shipping phosphorus fertilizer from
Florida to Carolinas, Tennessee,
[SPEAKER_03]: Idaho, places like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the potassium comes from
Saskatchewan and a lot of the nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's associated with natural gas,
comes from the Gulf area, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're resupplying the lost minerals by
using artificial fertilizer, but what we
[SPEAKER_03]: are not resupplying is the carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no biological component to
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just resupplying the inorganic
materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you end up with a situation like
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are just two soil health test
reports that Bob Shinlobek gave me,
[SPEAKER_03]: one from a Midwest grain farm and one from
a Northeast dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here are the physical indicators,
biological indicators, and chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: indicators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's ignore the chemical because it's all
basically fertilizer and lime.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can see that the physical and
biological indicators of the Midwestern
[SPEAKER_03]: farm score pretty low.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a lot of red and yellow,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see that the Northeast dairy farm
is mostly dark green, which means that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for these soil health indicators,
we're getting very good numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, of course, because there's a
lot of manure in the system and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's interesting is the one that's red
is phosphorus on the dairy farm because we
[SPEAKER_03]: down score when this phosphorus levels are
excessive, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a problem of excess here with
the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you have seen this map?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this map should be taught in every
introductory agronomy sustainable
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture course in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: This map shows you the flows of grain and
oil seed crops around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you see an arrow here,
I want you to imagine that it's a flow of
[SPEAKER_03]: soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a flow of the basic resources of
mineral and carbon that goes from one
[SPEAKER_03]: place to another, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's most of that coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Americas, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are most of it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: China, Japan, maybe some of the Korea,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at the blue arrows, which is
soybeans, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you follow the news, you know that
with all the trade wars, the Chinese are
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, well, maybe we don't want to buy
your soybeans anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're probably gonna source it from
the Brazilians, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we export two thirds of our soybeans
and half of that goes to China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every third row of soybeans that you
might see in a field in Iowa, is gonna go
[SPEAKER_03]: down the Mississippi River and to Iowa.
[SPEAKER_03]: But think of that as exporting soil health
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of it as the basic resources that
maintains the health of the soil are being
[SPEAKER_03]: exported.
[SPEAKER_03]: Note Japan here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually export a lot of corn to Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is in support of their dairy
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a picture from Hokkaido.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonam, where are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna probably see this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I visited Rintaro Kinoshita, my former
student there this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you look at these dairy farms and
there's three barns.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably 120 cows or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you look at the amount of land
that's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, wow, how can they possibly feed
this many cows from this little land?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of it gets imported from the
United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're building soil health in Japan,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Hokkaido is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where that picture was taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep in mind, again, Japan,
very mountainous country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these areas that are these
naturally productive areas, it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: urban.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Tokyo, Yokohama.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Nagoya.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Osaka.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all urbanized.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Japanese rely very heavily on the few
remaining agricultural lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one way they can kind of facilitate is
by importing a lot of those grains and
[SPEAKER_03]: thereby importing soil health,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Japan is not the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's Korea, my former home country.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Netherlands also import a lot of
grain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in some of these countries,
it's actually a big problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have problems with eutrophication in
the estuaries, in their freshwater
[SPEAKER_03]: resources, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now similarly, a typical organic farm here
in upstate New York is also a
[SPEAKER_03]: biogeochemical convergence zone because
they very heavily rely on compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: The compost is derived from whatever
leaves and leaf clippings or whatever from
[SPEAKER_03]: the surrounding region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're basically accumulating that
onto a relatively small area, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these organic farms are
actually starting to have some problems
[SPEAKER_03]: with high phosphorus levels as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an interesting example of
biogeochemical convergence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's right here on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the plant science building.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the manned library.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Nina Bassack in the horticulture
department every year with her class,
[SPEAKER_03]: she does kind of a renovation project,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the landscaping is just
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the soil here on campus is not
naturally that fertile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what Nina does is she calls a scoop
and dump.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come in, you put a lot of compost on
the soil and you kind of mix it in with a
[SPEAKER_03]: small excavator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have this wonderful soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the source of the compost that's
being applied?
[SPEAKER_03]: The dining halls here at Cornell,
other sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the food residues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where does that food come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe California, Idaho,
Florida, Texas, whatever, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So think about that, that when you look at
these little plants there in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: manned library, part of that came from
California or Idaho or Texas or places
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of bringing together these
basic resources of minerals and carbon and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting them in a place where we would
like them to be, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of interesting to ponder
that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're now talking about peak
phosphorus, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea of peak phosphorus,
like peak oil, it's like we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: running out of phosphorus fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The phosphorus mines in Florida and Idaho
are starting to run out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, oh, this is a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, is it really a problem?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we losing a lot of phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot is just a reallocation problem,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've now, we're accumulating
phosphorus on farms like here in central
[SPEAKER_03]: New York or in Eastern Carolina,
places like that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're exporting them from places like
Iowa and Illinois, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the peak phosphorus problem is
partially the structure of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what creates this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that we're running out of
phosphorus, it's just that we're putting
[SPEAKER_03]: it in places where it's not of great use
to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: While at the same time, having problems
like here, algae growth in Owasco Lake,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is just north of here, because we
have excess phosphorus, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that I think we need
to think about is like, in a way in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York, we are on the receiving end of a lot
of great mineral resources and carbon and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, we just pack it all into these
livestock-based farms, mostly dairy farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to spread that around a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I just want to show you a few data
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've done a lot of research and
published a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to show you, to give you a
little bit of an upbeat sort of end to
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a study from North Carolina where
we collaborated with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the cash test on a study that
involves different tillage practices from
[SPEAKER_03]: very intensive tillage to minimum till.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this shows you here, this is
protein and yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had 16 years of yield data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great data set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it shows you two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that as you reduce tillage,
you increase the protein levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of makes sense because protein is a
very labile form of carbon and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you till the soil, it will get very
easily decomposed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you don't till the soil,
you really kind of build it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you also see that it has a very good
relationship with yield, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good news.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the other indicators that has
significant correlations with yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ranked them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Protein was highest, organic matter was
the lowest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you look at these R-squared values.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for mean yield, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see the protein active carbon
manganese respiration had the highest
[SPEAKER_03]: correlations with yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Organic matter was only eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So total organic matter does not have as
good of a correlation with yield as these
[SPEAKER_03]: labile sources of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manganese, by the way, is involved with
organic matter decomposition through a
[SPEAKER_03]: redox reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are all associated with
biological processes and labile sources of
[SPEAKER_03]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agri-stability is a physical indicator
that we know is strongly related to
[SPEAKER_03]: biological processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to learn a lot about
soil health and what are important
[SPEAKER_03]: attributes of soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to skip this because we're
running out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to show this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Roli's slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're starting to work with Dan Buckley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are experts on microbial community
analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Roli, I think you've analyzed about
500, 700 samples or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming to our lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we take a little bit and we divert it
to Dan Buckley's lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Roli's been working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very exciting new area.
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Dan, you can do these
analyses for less than $20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is going to be an
important part of the future.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Conclusions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Natural forces spatially impact soil
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lower Nile Valley, Indo-Gangetic Plain,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anthropogenic forces are increasingly
affecting the flow of carbon, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: energy, and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost becoming the dominant
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have localized concentrations,
maybe with a small organic farm or dairy
[SPEAKER_03]: farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have these regional,
national, and even global flows of the
[SPEAKER_03]: basic resources around soil health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the concept of regenerative
agriculture or regenerative soil health
[SPEAKER_03]: management basically needs to recognize
that situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing that, what are some of the
opportunities?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the challenges?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of them is to use good agronomic
practices like reduced tillage,
[SPEAKER_03]: better rotations, cover crops,
geographically reintegrating livestock and
[SPEAKER_03]: crops, and also to think more deeply about
harvesting these nutrients in the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea that we have such a problem with
excess nutrients and carbon on these dairy
[SPEAKER_03]: farms here, and that we have other parts
of the state where the soils are starving
[SPEAKER_03]: for carbon and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we be a little bit more creative about
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that means processing some of
that manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Johannes is very interested in
pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very interested in pyrolyzing,
or maybe torrefaction, which is drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe other ways to process that manure
and make it logistically feasible to
[SPEAKER_03]: spread these resources around a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of wanted to stimulate that kind
of thinking, because I think in New York,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have that opportunity to solve some of
these problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, you need to understand the
source of that problem, which is very
[SPEAKER_03]: structural, very economically driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, with that, I already went a little bit
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is whether anaerobic
digestion impacts for all these processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not an expert in that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, what you're trying to do
there is capture some of the energy as
[SPEAKER_03]: methane, which you could also capture in
other ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could capture it through pyrolysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could capture it through direct
combustion.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it doesn't necessarily solve
this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a processing of the manure that
still retains the excess nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You reduce the carbon a little bit,
but it doesn't necessarily in a structural
[SPEAKER_03]: way, unless you take the residual material
and you take it off the dairy farm or off
[SPEAKER_03]: the livestock farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of this bigger picture
problem, it's not necessarily a solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm saying we need to maybe
think about a big part of the problem with
[SPEAKER_03]: manure is the bulkiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult to transport.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another issue is pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can address some of these
constraints and we can find ways to spread
[SPEAKER_03]: it around, for example, dried manure would
be much easier to transport over somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: longer distances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if you can get the manure 10 miles
out on the farm, it would do a tremendous
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both in terms of reducing the problem on
the livestock farm and helping the land
[SPEAKER_03]: off the livestock farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Woodbury is a real expert on this
idea of processing of manure, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: digestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he would be able to answer that better
than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of comparing or contrasting these
dairy farms and Midwest dairy farms,
you seem to focus on the difference in
animals in New York.
But I was wondering why you didn't
really...
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, these are very gross
generalizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are lots of livestock farms in the
Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of hog farms, also egg
farms, etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a gross generalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here in the Northeast, when we use
perennials, especially perennial legumes
[SPEAKER_03]: or maybe even cover crops are a relatively
small solution to this bigger problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're potentially useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, but the legumes primarily relate
to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it doesn't necessarily relate to
the other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But your point is well taken in that we
can grow some of that carbon here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can grow some of that carbon in
places like Iowa by using better
[SPEAKER_03]: rotations, bringing in cover crops and all
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can use those basic minerals
resource, even if they're synthetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can still build up the soils if
you use better rotations and better
[SPEAKER_03]: cropping systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's one part of that solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to chime in on that, I mean,
Harold mentioned the legume is getting
[SPEAKER_01]: exported around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that there aren't any legumes in
Iowa, it's just we're shifting into China,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there really is a mass balance
issue here that's pretty good enough.
Yes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for your talk and also for
discussing the part of Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a question that doesn't
necessarily get mentioned in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important that we don't
think of it as a path of being at history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still very much ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of people that have labor
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the effects of slavery that
happened in the past and the current
[SPEAKER_03]: structure of agriculture that is maybe not
labeled a slavery, but it's still a very
[SPEAKER_03]: unequal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's no, and I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I bring it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to have, it's something
that we tend to sort of sweep under the
[SPEAKER_03]: rug a little bit, but agriculture has been
the primary economic activity associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with slavery or sort of unequal treatment
of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's good for us to sort of
talk about what were sort of some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: underlying driving factors that were
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people had slaves basically
because they could in the ancient world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, this is a sequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have ample food production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about an expeditionary force.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can read about it in the historical
document in the scriptures where armies
[SPEAKER_03]: would go out and they would capture other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, you need to be able to
sustain an army, which is a logistical
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge even today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you need to bring those people
back and you need to defeat them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And enslave them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was a very sort of devious sort
of set of actions that sort of created
[SPEAKER_03]: that situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many millennia later, we actually
transported people across the ocean for
[SPEAKER_03]: the same purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we, you might argue that there's
some issues around the labor that we use
[SPEAKER_03]: in agriculture these days, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has also to do with the structure
of agriculture, that everything has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an expert in that area,
but I think it is important that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: honest about that's part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, if there are no more questions,
let's thank Geraldine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
