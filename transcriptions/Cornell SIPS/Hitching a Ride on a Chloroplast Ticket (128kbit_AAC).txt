[SPEAKER_04]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk to you about
today is kind of title doesn't say much,
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this research grew out of my PhD work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a chance discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to give you an idea of how I ended up
working on this and why we ended up going
[SPEAKER_00]: down this, I'm going to give a little bit
of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my PhD was on natural genetic variation
in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the rationale behind it was
to look at what variation is there to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can find where we're doing GWAS and
a couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes relevant for this variation,
which potentially could be used for
[SPEAKER_00]: improving crops and the likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do that, we had to come up
with a way of phenotyping photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an elusive phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed this system which could
measure 1,440 plants in less than an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could also measure a couple of
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as well as photosynthesis, which we
measured using chlorophyll fluorescence,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives us these kind of images here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also measured growth rate, which for
rabidopsis is pretty easy because it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: this flat architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just get an idea of plant size
by measuring projected leaf area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from this, we got other information,
such as leaf movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because, as you can see here,
more or less with the pointer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are getting bigger and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not because they're actually
getting bigger and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because their leaves are going up and
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot of other information from
these plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we had a spectral filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to measure its specific
wavelengths of light, which gave us an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of different pigment content in the
leaves and the cyanine, chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today, I'm going to focus on
photosynthesis, not on what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: primary research, but one of the spin-offs
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I measured this population of plants or
rabidopsis collected from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had 700 excessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We genotyped with 214,000 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took quite some time even to
measure that number because we did a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of replicates and to have good robust
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the phenotypic distribution
that came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see here, we have this nice
normal distribution here of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on the x-axis, we have
photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the y-axis, we have the number of
individuals in each bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have these guys down here,
which were really different from everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that these plants were
all of one particular genotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: which had considerably reduced
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty excited when I first came
across this because I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I looked into it,
I discovered somebody had already
[SPEAKER_00]: published on this, except it had a
different accession name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't know it was in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it was was a genotype which was
herbicide resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was resistant to triazine herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant had been collected in the
1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a railway track in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it had been in the stock
center since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this herbicide does is it targets the
photosystem II unit of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hits this protein here, this
photosystem protein D1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens normally with this D1
protein is that plastequinol binds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the primary electron acceptor,
which moves electrons down into the linear
[SPEAKER_00]: electron transport pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important for binding is this
serine here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see there's a hydrogen bonding site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And atrazine gets in there as well,
or any of these triazines, and blocks this
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket so that the electron transport flow
can no longer work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has an energy crisis,
and it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the herbicide is very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mutation, which has evolved
actually in 72 different species,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a great example of convergent
evolution, results in this serine being
[SPEAKER_00]: substituted with a glycine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The atrazine no longer bonds efficiently,
and the plant becomes resistant to this
[SPEAKER_00]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a consequence, of course, is that the
plastequinol also doesn't bond as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photosynthetic efficiency is
greatly lowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was that, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this plant which was herbicide
resistant, and basically it had already
[SPEAKER_00]: been described.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the problems was, and I think I
actually took this slide out, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a big reduction in growth rate
efficiency as well, which basically I come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a way of swapping the chloroplasts
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have here is we have the normal
wild type, which has this reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic efficiency of 16%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we then gave it a wild type
chloroplast, and we get this increased
[SPEAKER_00]: growth rate of 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it's photosystem II efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good proxy for carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not exactly the same, but it's
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes up to units of the maximum
possible efficiency for dark adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves is 0.83.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes from 0 to 0.83.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot go any higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually plants under steady state
conditions, so adapted to light growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: are operating between 0.6 and 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are down, in most cases,
depending on the light intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: around 0.4, 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a considerable drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at very low light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at 100 micromoles of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the actual efficiency in photosynthesis
drop is only 16%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a big impact on growth rates,
because the plants are, when they have
[SPEAKER_00]: this reduced chloroplast efficiency,
effectively working at probably their
[SPEAKER_00]: light compensation point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point at which the energy input is
only just about enough to keep the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its growth rate is very much so
compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the problem with this was that I
wanted to use this data for genome-wide
[SPEAKER_00]: association mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And genome-wide association mapping works
fine when you're loci on the nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had these 214,000 SNPs all located on
the nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this mutation is in the PSBA
protein, which is chloroplast encoded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I included this genotype in my
GWAS approach, it completely messed up the
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got lots of false positives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what was keeping this genotype
in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did some other research to overcome
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a thing that was bugging
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I discovered this at the beginning of
my PhD, found out it had already been
[SPEAKER_00]: published on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was still fresh in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I happened to be in Norwich,
here in England, giving a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ely is nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the wrong time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is August.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the time of the year that you
go collecting Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a spare couple of hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed the train.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went down to Ely railway station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people had thought, people that
originally published this knew it was
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1988, it was collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the herbicides, triazines,
were banned or discontinued in Europe in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1992.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody assumed this thing had died
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of curious to see whether,
indeed, it had died out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was still there, what was the
frequency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be a nice example,
I thought, of studying photosynthesis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have a mutant which occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, with a reduced photosynthetic
efficiency, how does it interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with higher photosynthesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of debate in the
world of photosynthesis, whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is limiting for plants or is it
something that the wild plants really need
[SPEAKER_00]: at a high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought we could answer a lot of
interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went there to Ely railway station.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the wrong time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found these little skeletons of dead
plants with a couple of seeds still stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pretty excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought them back to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a picture of the railway
station here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the station here, the railway
tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going into the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found plants here in the car park.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tested them to see if they were
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, most people had thought
that it probably would have died out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the assumption at this point was that
it had originated in Ely railway station,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's where it was first
discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was first collected in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no reason to think
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had these grand ideas of doing
transects away from the railway station,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how far it spread and what was the
interaction between resistant and
[SPEAKER_00]: non-resistant genotypes now that the
selective advantage was removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herbicide was no longer in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much of a cost is this reduced
photosynthesis in nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went back then in May 2013,
because I basically convinced my
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors that this was something we had
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were willing to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Arabidopsis growing in the
railway ballast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is just some sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went back again to Ely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the railway station,
which I showed you a picture of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started sampling all over the town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we tried to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't find any Arabidopsis outside
the railway station.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we found a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were like walking around this town
for two days, looking at every corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really couldn't find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, where is all the
Arabidopsis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a little bit of research
into the history of Ely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out Ely is actually a clay
island, which was surrounded by fen,
[SPEAKER_00]: or bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Arabidopsis doesn't really like clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly doesn't grow on bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these fens had already been drained in
the past 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not prime Arabidopsis territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice down here, so this is
the railway track coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one plant collected also along the
railway track, just a bit further away,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we walked down this road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that plant was also resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we started thinking, so Ely
Arabidopsis is probably not native to Ely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably came in on the railway tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And railway tracks are good Arabidopsis
habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're relatively free of
competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, it didn't originate
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it must have come from somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's sample along the railway tracks
and see if we can track out where it came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back a month later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically just took lots of trains
all over this part of England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sampled all these railway stations,
which I regretted that in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have rented a car, because trains
don't go out very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you spend two or three hours
in some dump somewhere, no way out,
[SPEAKER_00]: which happened in this place, Kennet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope nobody's from Kennet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stuck there for ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so went around collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found the Arabidopsis pretty much in
all the railway stations, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of these places, there were
resistant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this resistance had spread quite far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had no idea actually how far it
spread, because we didn't go beyond,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it hadn't stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got really interested in this and
thought, well, this must have spread all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to be able to track it
down, because we don't know which
[SPEAKER_00]: direction to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough information from this
where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, let's have a look at
what's available in the genotype databases
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what's related to this resistant
individual that we have genetic markers
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 214,000 markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this RegMap panel available
of 1,307 plants, all of which had been
[SPEAKER_00]: genotyped with these 214,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did basically a relatedness assay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had this one genotype, which was
much more closely related than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else to this resistant individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, OK, that's a good starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is this genotype from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this genotype was from here,
Ledbury, basically near the Welsh border
[SPEAKER_00]: in England.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ely is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're quite far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, maybe it really has spread
very far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we thought, well, what else can
we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What other information can we use to get
enough information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought, well, there's another
genotype data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot more plants, almost 6,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got a lot less markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, we might be able to get some
information from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically plotted the possible
origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these yellow dots are where
genotypes were collected from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this color, so dark, means less likely
to be from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And white means more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had this hope that we would get a
nice idea of these purple lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way, the railway tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's not very obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few locations where we're pretty
sure it's not from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it could be from anywhere
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even it looks like it could be from
northern France, which I don't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this didn't work as well as one would
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this set of 6,000 lines,
there were four that were identical for
[SPEAKER_00]: all 149 markers to the Ely genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I checked them, and I genotyped
them for the mutation, every single one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them was resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were the same plant from the same
mutation event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they were from was even further
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was down in Cornwall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about 400 kilometers, as the crow
flies between these two locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, well, we want to
investigate this a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: see how far it's really spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do a sampling strategy around
this area of southwest England,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had these two data points
pointing us in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot more sampling along railway
tracks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually a herbicide, not
triazines, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't spray them anymore,
probably glyphosate or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: or abidopsis along the railway tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went to Leadbury as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were a bit disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in total, including the sampling in the
east of England, we had 573 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in total, we got 52 resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the southwest, apart from the place
where they had originally been collected
[SPEAKER_00]: from, or these four individuals in this
panel of six thousand, we didn't find it
[SPEAKER_00]: back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may have gone extinct, although that
railway station was being renovated at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the place was completely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't find much in the way of our
abidopsis in the actual station.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did find it out here in Worchester
independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do know that it has spread quite
considerable distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all these brownish lines are
railway tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the original area that we
sampled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's quite a lot of
plants from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was interesting about it
was that it was completely associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: railway tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we sampled, we sampled on railway
tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always went away into the town and
tried to get non railway track samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And never did we find the resistance away
from the railways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 100 percent association with the
railways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was something that evolved on our
new railway track and then spread all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question was, well,
was this a single event?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had these 52 plants collected from
different parts of England.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it one mutation event or did it evolve
multiple times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because bear in mind, this mutation has
evolved on 72 separate occasions in
[SPEAKER_00]: different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that seems to evolve
relatively regularly in response to
[SPEAKER_00]: triazine application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just did a simple, we didn't use a
lot of markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we needed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 32 snips spread across the genome
and we genotyped all of the 500 plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: get an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single resistant individual was
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all completely identical for
all 32 snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, this was pretty convincing that
it was one mutation event which then
[SPEAKER_00]: spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the hitchhiking comes
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we started thinking about
this and what does this actually mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to explain genetic
hitchhiking just as a refresher for those
[SPEAKER_00]: of you who are not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is genetic hitchhiking in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have basically a piece of DNA
and each of these lines represents
[SPEAKER_00]: different individuals in a population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colorful blocks represent snips or
polymorphisms with reference to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of these individuals gets a
mutation which is beneficial in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it starts rising in frequency,
you get what's known as a selective sweep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be the post selective sweep
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see that obviously this is much
more common because it adds a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the interesting thing to pay attention
to is that these polymorphisms which
[SPEAKER_00]: provide no direct fitness advantage have
also raised in frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because of this physical
linkage to the selected locus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're literally linked physically on the
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is classical genetic sweep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does depend on physical linkage and
the classical understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all occurs in the nucleus because
you've got these big chromosomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got recombination there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our mutation is on the
chloroplast which is obviously not
[SPEAKER_00]: physically linked to any loci in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet we had complete fixation of these
nuclear genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these nuclear genomes had arisen to
this frequency purely on the back of this
[SPEAKER_00]: chloroplast mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had basically, as I said,
hitched the ride on this chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, genetic linkage is something
which is generally assumed to occur only
[SPEAKER_00]: when things are physically linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's restricted by recombination.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important phenomena and it's
recently been shown to resolve Lewontin's
[SPEAKER_00]: paradox which is this, basically according
to neutral theory in evolution,
[SPEAKER_00]: there should be a linear relationship
between population size and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the population, the lower the
genetic diversity is compared to what we
[SPEAKER_00]: would expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has been recently, I mean,
it's been often considered that selection
[SPEAKER_00]: is the cause of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection will operate more efficiently in
large populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of this physical linkage,
when you get selection, you get a region
[SPEAKER_00]: around it which is reduced in diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what you're happening,
it's called genetic draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, when hitchhiking occurs across the
whole genome, the phenomena is genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dragging the diversity down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does happen in larger populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very important phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always assumed exclusively to
occur within the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no literature considering how
selection on organelles could affect
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there's no physical
linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think people don't really think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're showing that there has been
very strong selection on an organelle
[SPEAKER_00]: which has resulted in a complete change in
the diversity of the nuclear genomes in
[SPEAKER_00]: these populations of Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is probably because Arabidopsis
is highly inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have a physical linkage,
but you have a statistical linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how important the level of inbreeding
is compared to the intensity of selection
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that we don't know but we're
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what I'm showing is something
very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting about it is that it
hasn't been observed before, and it hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really been considered in the literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does selection on organelles
indirectly affect nuclear genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I think, is particularly
interesting because it's becoming more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more obvious that there is indeed a lot of
selection on organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at southern hemisphere
beech trees, Nothophagus, basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of the organelles doesn't match
up with the diversity of the nuclear
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity of organelles shows a
latitudinal gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some organelles are better adapted to
different temperatures, and these move
[SPEAKER_00]: actually between species.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear genetic diversities don't
match.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got strong selection on these
organelles for adaptation to these
[SPEAKER_00]: different climatic zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have such kind of selection,
you potentially, as we show here,
[SPEAKER_00]: can have linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: These processes could cause distortions in
nuclear gene frequencies, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, does it require
inbreeding or any level of inbreeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will require modeling to go
forward with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, the main point I'm getting
at is that selection on organelles can
[SPEAKER_00]: affect nuclear genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people that I've tried to
explain this to found it a bit confusing
[SPEAKER_00]: and wanted me to illustrate it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought about it quite long and hard
as how to show this in a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated and clear way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came up with basically this figure,
which I think aptly shows how the
[SPEAKER_00]: organelles can distort nuclear gene
frequencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is basically what I wanted to
show to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through it a little bit fast,
I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some remaining questions,
things that need to be addressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how common is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is a particularly
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we stumbled upon this, which is what I
was trying to get at the way I told the
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not looking for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came across this phenomena.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew the selective agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew the locus which was providing
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had all this prior information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had this nice system of railway
tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had the region where the selective
agent was applied and where it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very clear that selection was
occurring on the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were able to see that the
nuclear genome had hitchhiked along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you actually know that the
chloroplast is under selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: the selective agent and the site of
selection is pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have the prior knowledge
we have, how would you be able to find
[SPEAKER_00]: these phenomena, which I think is an
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because almost all of the population
genetic studies looking at the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of selective sweeps is
exclusively looking at diversity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pretty much ignore what's going
on in the organelles, even though they can
[SPEAKER_00]: be under selection a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, how do we detect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the evolutionary consequences
of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it distort nuclear genetic diversity
as much as we now realize genetic draft
[SPEAKER_00]: operating within the nucleus can distort
nuclear genetic diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big an impact can it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, it's becoming more
and more clear that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: selection operating on organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this selection is also distorting
nuclear gene frequencies, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences could this have for
evolution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it can lead to a loss of,
and another thing is the intergenome
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these organelles have to communicate
with the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very tight relationship to regulate
all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got one organelle increasing
rapidly in frequency due to selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the associated nuclear genomes,
if any of them are less well adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, then you can have also distortions
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone faster than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably skipped something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do this alone, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was stuff, like I said, that grew out
of my PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my two supervisors, Mark and Jeremy,
promoter Martin Corniff, who basically
[SPEAKER_00]: made sure that I graduated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then help in the lab from Frank and
from Bas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two guys helped me out with just
basic stuff in the lab, helping along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of the analysis I did with
a guy called Joost van Heverden,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, with that, I thank you for your
attention, and I hope that maybe you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some questions or comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit more of the molecular
mechanisms on how the environment and the
[SPEAKER_04]: gene of the organelle interact that drives
the selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the interaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: In brief, there's like trains that spray
herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the environmental pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these special trains that they
designed that drive along railway tracks
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying herbicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the selective pressure,
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it knocks out polysynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a simple amino acid substitution,
which provides resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this plant is occurring on a
railway track, which has these trains
[SPEAKER_00]: moving, non-railway herbicide spraying
trains, moving up and down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been quite a lot of evidence
to show that they produce these wind
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, which distributes seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get them stuck in their shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of way for it to disperse
along railways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's how it actually spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a nice example of
congruency between human-induced chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: changes and human-created infrastructure
providing avenues for changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: geneticized plant populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that one is clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was more interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The molecular and cellular, where this
gene has interacted with the pressure,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was in the organelle that was driving
the selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are there other examples in mammals or
other plants that essentially are
[SPEAKER_04]: organelles?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is plenty of evidence of selection
occurring in organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the first time anybody's ever
miswired telling this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody's ever considered that the
selection of the organelle can distort
[SPEAKER_00]: nuclear gene frequencies through this
effective linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a statistical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a physical or a biological
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just by chance, it's a stochastic
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This organelle occurred in this nuclear
genetic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nuclear genetic background got a free
ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I answering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this what you're looking for?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is evidence of organelles
being important for lots of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: In plants, they're important for water use
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been really nice studies done
using reciprocal plants of sunflowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they've been progressed,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made reciprocal real populations,
so reciprocal segregating populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been able to show that the
cytoplasmic background, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: whether they were able to show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's difficult to disentangle the
nucleolus peri-related chloroplasts in my
[SPEAKER_00]: country, because they're always inherited
together, at least in most organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were able to show that these had
a big impact on, for example, survival of
[SPEAKER_00]: the drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an example of local adaptation
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really nice empirical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you also see, like I mentioned
with the southern hemisphere beach,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see these really nice latitudinal
stratification of different chloroplasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not of the nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they cause the chloroplast
mitochondrial genome duplication as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in the evolution of genomes,
sometimes you have these two-plugin
[SPEAKER_04]: particle of genomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see any duplication of the
mitochondrial genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a plant species with this massive
mitochondrial genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's Saline, which just expands
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you wondering about when
polyploidy happens, or I'm not really
[SPEAKER_00]: following?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, polyploidy is just something that
happens in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because mitochondria and chloroplasts
already are effectively polyploid,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's many copies of them in
every cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if I fully understood you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about heteroplasmy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine a situation where you have
both the wild type and the mutated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be advantageous for a plant
to have both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I checked for heteroplasmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never found it in Arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was a nice science paper published
in, I think it was the late 80s or early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget exactly when, which has almost
never been cited, interestingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they showed that, what was the
species?
[SPEAKER_00]: Synesio had heteroplasmy for resistant and
non-resistant chloroplasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a way of maintaining this
heteroplasmy, which is most interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people studied
heteroplasmy in tissue culture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1990s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they did these protoplast
fusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a mixed bag of
organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost always, it segregates out
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get one branch which has one
particular chloroplast, another branch
[SPEAKER_00]: which has another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitochondria are a bit more promiscuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, they actually mix their genomes,
and you get this hybrid mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chloroplasts don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, the original literature I've
read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually, the assumption is that
heteroplasmy is never really maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lost out during mitosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this organism was able to maintain
heteroplasmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, interestingly, when they subjected
its selection, so for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: strong herbicide application, it went to
homoplasmy of resistant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never went back after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the non-resistant ones have
gone extinct somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the absence of the herbicide
application, somehow it was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain heteroplasmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's ever really followed that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only known example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't go into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the beginning, you showed a plot
with a photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems to be a complex trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that you wanted to do GWAS,
but you never really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually wanted to look at nuclear
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would have been a different
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, to answer your question,
yes, indeed, I did GWAS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found some loci.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I don't know, has anybody
here done GWAS on complex traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you happy with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, my answer would be,
for me, I thought it was a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointing, probably because it was
oversold to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was very gullible and believed all
of the stories I was told.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, most of the large effect
loci, the large effect loci we found had
[SPEAKER_00]: already been found for disease resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it affects photosynthesis because it
gives an autoimmune.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the plants start killing their
leaves before other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see this coming off as a massive
reduction in photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find other loci, but I didn't
manage in the time I had to follow them
[SPEAKER_00]: and characterize them fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they made sense in certain genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did find stuff, if that's what you were
wondering about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you what I've done later,
but I can't remember all of the stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm completely on board with your concept
that nuclear genes can hitchhike with the
[SPEAKER_05]: organelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm skeptical as to whether you really
have an example of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason I'm skeptical is that
triazine spraying hasn't been used that
[SPEAKER_05]: long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this plant could have arisen perhaps on
your birthday, the day you were born.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these plants are actually fairly
young, like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do we know they've had enough time
for the nuclear variation to occur rather
[SPEAKER_05]: than it simply being that they haven't had
enough time to get old and change?
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you have a way to refute my
skepticism?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what you mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's my theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason you're finding all the nuclear
genomes the same is they simply haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: had enough time to change, especially
since you've got an inbreeding species.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an out-crossing species,
then I would agree there must be some
[SPEAKER_05]: reason that they're staying the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have an inbreeding species,
these plants could be at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that they're the same is not a
problem for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that the hitchhiking
hasn't occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that the hitchhiking was
extremely tight linkage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what is interesting is why did we
never see out-crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did we never see a individual which
had the resistant chloroplast,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was of a mixed nuclear genotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the answer to that is we don't
have to do enough sampling, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably out there,
but it occurs at a low frequency because,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you say, our paradoxes is highly
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that we see no differences is a
combination of the fact that we've only
[SPEAKER_00]: got 32 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we did all genome sequencing,
we'd see more polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: 32 SNPs is not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hasn't been a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that hitchhiking has
not occurred, unless I misunderstood.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my point is you haven't proven
that it has occurred because you simply
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have enough time, and Arabidopsis
has a fairly low out-crossing frequency.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: In England, I imagine somebody's measured
how much out-crossing happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got an out-crossing frequency between
0.95 inbreeding to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost completely inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely believe that the nuclear
genome is probably dragged along with the
[SPEAKER_05]: organelle genome under many circumstances,
since there are protein complexes in the
[SPEAKER_05]: chloroplast that are from both nuclear and
organelle genes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would imagine that there is some
reason that you would want to have those
[SPEAKER_05]: nuclear genes that fit best with the
organelle genome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just don't think you have shown it
yet with the amount of data that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not suggesting that there is a
co-adaptation between this nucleus and
[SPEAKER_00]: this chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not suggesting that either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that unless you have more
time and more plants and more
[SPEAKER_05]: out-crossing, I think it's hard to say
that the reason that those nuclear genomes
[SPEAKER_05]: are all the same is because of dragging
along the nuclear genome with the
[SPEAKER_05]: organelle genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the alternative hypothesis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How else would they be all the same?
[SPEAKER_05]: That there simply hasn't been enough
out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you haven't collected enough plants to
see the ones that are out-crossed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could be right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would want more proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you can accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really get it, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that they're all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that your evidence isn't
strong enough yet, because you need more
[SPEAKER_05]: plants and more markers to look for
whether they really are all the same,
[SPEAKER_05]: or whether they just haven't had enough
time to out-cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these plants could have arisen in
1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they were collected in 1988.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, 1988.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they originated, as I said,
on your birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tritonsines were sprayed in England since
1960.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most evidence regarding the rate of
evolution of resistance is that it happens
[SPEAKER_00]: within 10 years, in most instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably it was around since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still not a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that they're all identical is
like we know it was one event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this nuclear genome has nothing to do
with resistance yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that much higher frequency as a
consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, per definition, at least how I
understand it, genetic hitchhiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if another population spawned from a
single ancestor in 1970, and you tracked
[SPEAKER_01]: that population and looked at the
variation, they both started at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time and diverged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that have as many differences
either?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would that have many differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would all of the genomes formed by that
population, or seen in those populations,
[SPEAKER_01]: look the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another way of looking at this is that the
triazine essentially extinguished all
[SPEAKER_02]: other competitive nuclear genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really nothing left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they're out-crossing, they're
still the same nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have inbreeding going on in an
incredibly intense way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably occurred when it spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we go back and sample,
these plants occur in mixed stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: With other species?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, with other resistant individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the possibility for out-crossing is
certainly there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there was not a possibility of
out-crossing for as long as the active
[SPEAKER_02]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to find the opportunity
for out-crossing within the genetically
[SPEAKER_02]: different genomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1992.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you basically have at most 25 years for
something to explore other nuclear genomes
[SPEAKER_02]: as a host.
[SPEAKER_02]: The evidence is not that strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is that the nuclear genome
has already increased massively in
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even as it out-crosses and this nuclear
genome gets into other organelle
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds and vice versa, it has
massively increased in frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rare genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we showed with the relatedness,
apart from the resistant individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't find many plants close to
relatedness in the whole of England or in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwestern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an odd one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's at a much higher frequency than
it ever was before, which is hitchhiking,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could also be seen as a founder effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially what you have is like an
island that is a long railway,
[SPEAKER_03]: and no one else can live in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is there any residual herbicide
right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herbicide's definitely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also because there's species of bacteria
which evolved to eat it as a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can also see it as a founder
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you that it's hitchhiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the founder effect and hitchhiking are
two sides at the same point, as I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a look of association with a
particular locus that gives you a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency or the look of getting on the
island first.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hitchhiking occurs with more
individuals that are competing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'll just take the founder
effect as a small sample size that goes to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around the region where the selection
occurs in the genome, it's effectively
[SPEAKER_00]: like a founder effect, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, another way to really go into the
data and really time this out would be to
[SPEAKER_03]: just draw up what that simulation and just
time exactly when that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could answer the- Well,
I would need sequence data to be able to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since you have a couple of SNPs,
you have an expectation number of nuclear
[SPEAKER_03]: polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they're completely identical for
all 32 SNPs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the nuclear?
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: 32?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, spread across the genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's completely inbreeding,
like you were suggesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the reason we haven't found
any outbreedings is because we haven't had
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a lot more sampling to be able to
find at the rate of outbreeding that would
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have an experiment for you to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You showed in your little map that you had
some railway stations where there were
[SPEAKER_05]: non-triazine resistant and triazine
resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not collect seeds and then see if
there's any outcrossing?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're saying that the reason those
plants are all one nuclear genome is
[SPEAKER_05]: because there's been selection for them,
why don't you measure the rate of
[SPEAKER_05]: outcrossing in those regions where the
plants are located?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did find some outcrossing in the
non-resistant genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is outcrossing occurring in these
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just never lucky enough to find one
which outcrossed with a resistant plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a resistant plant which had any degree
of outcrossing plants around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make it one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is perfectly cross-pollinatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no physiological barrier there to
prevent this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe there is in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for some reason that plant is less
likely to outcross in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flower at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no sort of making in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all flowering more or less at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot rule it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never found any evidence to suggest
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my feeling is I just didn't have
enough samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if I went back and sampled even
more intensively with hundreds of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from each population, I would find
eventually an outcrossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember answering your question
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was tapped on as an example of
what Murray was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a different question about
something slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that this is what happens
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But could you ever imagine a case where
you have a chloroplast gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not physically linked,
of course, to the nuclear gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a genetic interaction,
like proteins interact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get genetic draft from not
the chloroplast gene, but nuclear genes
[SPEAKER_01]: that work well with that chloroplast gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you kind of have this chloroplast
having an indirect genetic draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have something as complex as
photosynthetic machines, could you imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: that happening, like engaging in multiple
sites throughout the nuclear genome?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can't distinguish chloroplast
genetic hitchhiking from indirect nuclear
[SPEAKER_01]: draft?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the best example of that is
cytoplasmic male sterility, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, and this occurs in the mitochondria
usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one example of the journey of
chloroplast, where you have some usually
[SPEAKER_00]: PPR proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the mitochondria evolves to
kill the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mitochondria doesn't want plants to
have pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rationale behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's not thinking like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a selective advantage if it's
in a mother plant, because there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the male sterile plants usually
produce more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get more out-crossing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, you get advantages of hybrid
vigor and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, as it rises in frequency,
more and more of the plants are no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: able to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there becomes an advantage to be able
to produce pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this cytoplasmic background has also
increased in frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you get the evolution of restore
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically have an arms race
between a nuclear genome and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these PPR proteins, or the proteins
that often are restore factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: show a very similar evolutionary pattern
to pathogen resistance genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They occur in these kind of cassettes of
duplicates and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really looks like almost an immune
interaction between the nucleus and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of proteins working together,
and in our particular example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't go into it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because this genotype worried me so
much, as it messed up my GWAS results,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with a way, along with another
PhD student, of using a myotic mutant,
[SPEAKER_00]: a genome-eliminator line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may have heard of this
chemistry line from Simon Chan,
[SPEAKER_00]: to eliminate the nuclear genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I introgressed this mutation into
multiple cytoplasmic backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a di allele of nuclear
cytoplasmic combinations, complete
[SPEAKER_00]: reciprocal di allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I included this resistant genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works perfectly fine with all other
cytoplasms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is no physiological basis,
or at least no evidence for physiological
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, for this association between the
chloroplast and the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're looking at, what I argue we're
looking at, is a statistical association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look that this genotype occurred,
this nuclear genotype occurred,
[SPEAKER_00]: with this chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which got resistant to the herbicide,
arose in frequency due to the selective
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage, and perhaps the clear habitat
along the railway tracks, got to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: high frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The selective pressure is no longer there
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's occurring in mixed stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the damage, so to speak, is already
being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has done the hitchhiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now at a very high frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has had the benefit of being close to
being associated with this chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why I argue it is genetic
hitchhiking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that they're identical,
the nuclear genomes are identical,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least for pretty good reason,
which occur with this chloroplast,
[SPEAKER_00]: is evidence for that happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, please join me in thanking for
everything.

University on the web at cornell.edu.
