[SPEAKER_03]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real joy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually feel like I'm coming home,
at least to my scientific home,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to sort of begin with sort of
a tribute to my inspirations in science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings a tear to my eyes to have the
gentleman here today in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was an Ithaca College student.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I would want to be a physical
therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went there, but I was working in the
biology department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of my job was actually to clean
test tubes and clean fly traps and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that I really loved
chemistry more than I loved biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I really mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why physical therapy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why biology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met Rich Wazinski.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he really sort of inspired me to think
about biochemistry and think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: cells were working in a biochemical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started doing research really
early on in his lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a tough guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me think really critically and was
very attention to detail and make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: can communicate your science well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to hang out with this guy who
I learned a lot about, Steve Beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to walk across the hill and
come through the gorge and come to the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and meet up with scientists and go out to
lunch and learn about Chinese cuisine as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Rich and Steve share this vision of
Chinese food and also getting together to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember over many hot and sour soups
that we would be talking about what
[SPEAKER_00]: Irwinio was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't understand that at all at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really sort of my research spark
was really studying fire of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was me back in 1988 in Rich's lab
when we were hanging out with another
[SPEAKER_00]: student and really taught me the
essentials of microbiology and
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, what we were most interested
in was not necessarily how Irwinio was
[SPEAKER_00]: causing disease of fire of light,
but really what were the antibiotics
[SPEAKER_00]: produced by another closely related
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my research project was actually how
are antibiotics inhibiting the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: Irwinio in a lot of our pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so doing simple biochemistry,
we were able to actually show that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting amino acid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, that was a real spark to
walk away with an answer that was so
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfying at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really gave me the inspiration to think
bigger, to go on and do biochemistry in
[SPEAKER_00]: some other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really came back to after
graduate school was thinking about really
[SPEAKER_00]: then how are the pathogens manipulating
these hosts to cause disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have a plant pathology card,
but I do have a great inspiration and a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathology background in biochemistry
that kind of launched me to my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I went to Brian Staskowitz's lab,
I was working on type three secretion and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to come up with the biochemical
evidence that they were secreting
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules into plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a lot of time as a postdoc trying
to come up with that evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I left his lab, there was still
sort of the uncertainty of really what are
[SPEAKER_00]: those molecules doing and how are they
causing disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I chose to use a system that he was
using in the lab and essentially because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was the genetics on both the pathogen
side and the plant side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at Xanthomonas eubesicatoria,
I will just use the strain name mostly in
[SPEAKER_00]: my talk was 8510.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the time the genome sequence
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some information about what was
going on, but we didn't know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectors were or how the virulence
factors were controlling what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial spot disease in tomato where you
see these nice lesions and the chlorotic
[SPEAKER_00]: outgrowth of that which is mostly due to
ethylene production and salicylic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: production in these infected leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought this would be a good
launch pad to start thinking about what is
[SPEAKER_00]: effector biology and I think you all are
aware of type 3 secretion and that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are pumping proteins into plant
cells by the type 3 secretion system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I started my lab, there was a
great enthusiasm about doing genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: screens to find this whole repertoire of
proteins that are being injected into
[SPEAKER_00]: plant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we used some cool genetic screens
using type 3 signal peptides which I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: go into, but also the work here of Alan
Colmer and Greg Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have also used whole genome
sequencing bioinformatics and more
[SPEAKER_00]: recently from Guido Sessa's lab using
machine learning approaches to find some
[SPEAKER_00]: new effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using this information we kind of have
a nice collection of Xanthomonas proteins
[SPEAKER_00]: that we call Zops and we essentially have
about 40 plus or minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't look at a lot of different
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in trying to get at
specific host targets and understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms of action, but also how those
targets are playing out in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they really doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they sensitive nodes of the
pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've been focusing on are
those Xanthomonas proteins that we call
[SPEAKER_00]: the core group that seem to be highly
conserved among strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also, because I'm interested
in signaling and how properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: virulence can be shared amongst many
diverse pathogens, try to focus on a few
[SPEAKER_00]: of these that have effectors that are in
both animal and plant pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look out in the field for
tomato and we find isolates through Jeff
[SPEAKER_00]: Jones' work in Florida as well as Brian
Staskiewicz and you look at the collection
[SPEAKER_00]: of these strains and you sequence what the
effect or what repertoires are,
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I just wanted to say was that
even if you're looking at some that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have known about for a while and collected
or ones that are emerging as being real
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic in the field, they seem to
have a conserved set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a subset of them that I'm
just highlighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names are kind of irrelevant,
but the ones that are shown in orange here
[SPEAKER_00]: are ones that my laboratory has been
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primarily because when you make gene
deletions, they have significant effects
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ability of the bacteria to grow in
the leaves, but also their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: either produce symptoms or suppress
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they gave us a good handle of a
starting point of those that seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: quite important in the genomes of these
pathogens, irregardless where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: being isolated from in California or
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to put this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is used a lot in many talks,
but I wanted to kind of give it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation of where I started out and the
types of things that I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about the evolution of
post-pathogen interactions, we know that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more recently about what are the
receptors that are recognizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: conserved features on microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a bit about the signaling pathways
for these basal immune responses or we
[SPEAKER_00]: call these camp trigger immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that the effectors now,
some 20 years later, many of these are
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing these pathways, but we still
don't have a good understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: are all the targets and what are the
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's plenty of recognition by
resistance genes or NLRs that are
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing these molecules and turning on
a more robust immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I wanted to sort of add my
contribution to the field was I was not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily interested in identifying
initially these R genes I kind of wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask what were sort of those
susceptibility nodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was really the pathogen doing with
this effector at this layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially how is it inhibiting those
initial signaling events for camp
[SPEAKER_00]: triggered immunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an overview of a snapshot
in case people are interested in talking
[SPEAKER_00]: more deeply about these in future talks
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my group has been working on a number
of these different effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you about two here today,
but I also talked up at Geneva about the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural product discovery pathway that
we've been working on with a collaborator
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been really good at trying to find
antimicrobial compounds in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm not going to talk about
AVRVST, which is one that appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: separating many proteins within the
cytoplasm and triggering a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: an ETI or effector trigger response that I
still can't figure out what the R gene is
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd love to figure out how I can
find that in tomato and pepper,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can find some new collaborators to do
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one is a molecule that I
still can't figure out what its enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: function is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Alan Comer wrote a really nice,
and Magdalene, I think I saw her
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, yes, in this default defense
idea where many times you're hitting it
[SPEAKER_00]: with a sledgehammer of an effector and if
you have too many in there, essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a defaulted defense and maybe it's a
highly conserved process within the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cell that's under attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some ideas that we think is
probably hitting translation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're trying to explore that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I want to tell you a couple
stories today about two proteins that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been working on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motivation here was to give the
students an idea of how we get to these
[SPEAKER_00]: targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have the host targets,
how are we thinking about studying them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at the time course of
infection for this, we can either dip
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves or we can infiltrate them with our
bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking at is sort of
what's happening over a two week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at symptom development
to the point where we can see spots about
[SPEAKER_00]: in between day A and day 11, we start to
see the leaves becoming chlorotic and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to fall apart, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is correlating with high
bacterial load.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were missing early on,
because a lot of the work was being done
[SPEAKER_00]: in Arabidopsis, looking within a few days
to see how effectors were working,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually had to stretch that out a
little bit to see our phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I point out, we're actually
looking in this day one to day eight
[SPEAKER_00]: window to get the readout of what the
signaling effect was of each molecule that
[SPEAKER_00]: we were testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to point out is that
Zop-D, although I'm not showing you the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth curve, it's working early at about
day four to day six, where we can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of its effects in symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zop-D works a little bit later
downstream in this symptom development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of signaling, if we go back to
that overview, if we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanthomonas turning on hand-triggered
immunity, we were essentially thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that Zop-N was probably working early,
at the early stages of infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Zop-D is working a bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to tell you about today is
that we think that Zop-N has a protein
[SPEAKER_00]: scaffolding activity that is suppressing
PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zop-D is a really interesting enzyme
mimic that works in the nucleus to repress
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to show you those data and
then the projects that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with Zop-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started working on this with my first
graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an unusual protein,
highly conserved in almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanthomonas strain that we've looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be a core effector molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to crystallize this protein
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to have a very unstructured
motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it forms alkyl helical
coils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our predictions, and so we predict
that maybe it was a scaffold anchoring
[SPEAKER_00]: onto two proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it suppresses PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you those data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we found is it forms a complex
with two proteins in the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's schematically shown here as
this receptor-like kinase, although this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a dead kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have an active cytoplasmic
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very short LLR region that's
extracellular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zop-N seems to be binding to it very
tightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's binding to one region of this protein
at one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other region of this effector is
binding to a 14-3-3 molecule called TFT-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in tomato, the 14-3-3s are called
tomato 14-3-3s or TFTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know that from Greg Martin's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we really noticed was that both
of these players, if we knock them out of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, they're more susceptible to
Xanthomonas infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see that this is suppressing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably by trapping it in an inactive
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually want to test this more
carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I won't go into preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to give an overview of the
project that we have, a new project in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab for the graduate student, Andrew
Guzman, which is to actually find this
[SPEAKER_00]: complex at the plant plasma membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the prediction is that if the
protein is trapping this receptor complex,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is it normally interacting with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't believe that this is a
receptor that's recognizing Xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe it's working with a pattern
recognition receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some phosphatases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 14-3-3s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some other scaffolds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Zoe had pulled out a protein
that had a very interesting schematic like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were tantalizing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a PRR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have yet to determine if that's
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, essentially, we want to
understand what this complex is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also opened up the door to thinking
why is it trapping 14-3-3s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 14-3-3s are really important
signaling molecules in organizing protein
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes, also for organizing and
activating or repressing enzyme activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 14-3-3 proteins are actually
dimers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be homodimers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see two molecules here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're binding phosphate groups
generally on proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll find that these, in many data
sets that people have been publishing,
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be nodes or targets of effector
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we got really inspired by this to
thinking, one, we don't know very much
[SPEAKER_00]: about 14-3-3s in plant biology or
eukaryotic signaling in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really understand why
effector molecules would bond to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think about how normal proteins
bond to 14-3-3s in cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you take a look at this
schematic, you have 14-3-3 diners here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a client, essentially,
who can come in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often, the clients get phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get phosphorylated by kinases.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14-3-3s like to bind to phosphorylated
residues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see they'll anchor in here
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what can have different outcomes
of these interactions?
[SPEAKER_00]: One, they can bring proteins together and
assemble them for signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they can turn off an enzymatic
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought, hmm, this could be very
powerful for a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can rewire how these guys are
talking to those proteins, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: affect immune responses or other
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked the simple question,
are effectors clients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they actually being bound into these
14-3-3 complexes to become activated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they antagonists by trying to
disrupt their function?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see from the literature is
that, at least in animal pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there's evidence
that they are actually clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's an example for the effector
called PexoS.
[SPEAKER_00]: This protein actually has ADP,
right, fossil transferase activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The detail of that is not important,
but it's very important for having
[SPEAKER_00]: cytotoxic effects in mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it needs to bind to
this complex to become enzymatically
[SPEAKER_00]: active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, it's a client.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a chaperone or a scaffold
for activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our work, it seems that Zop-M seems to
be the antagonist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interfering with its activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've shown that TFT1,
one of the isoforms in tomato,
[SPEAKER_00]: is required for PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at conflict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which way to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are these 14-3-3s being co-opted?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we then looked into the literature,
and I brought up some of the nice work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been done in Greg Martenslau,
because he's been actually looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: 14-3-3s in PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my group was focusing a lot trying to
understand how PTI signaling was being
[SPEAKER_00]: abrogated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you take a look at the
pseudomonas tomato model, Greg's nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: shown that AVRPTO and PTO-PRF signaling
actually requires TFT7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's requiring the scaffolding
protein to organize that kinase signaling,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is leading to programmed cell death
or resistance activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also showed that that was required
for other effector R protein combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they seem to be important molecules in
signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we see from other arabidopsis,
tobacco, and rice systems, that you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find other R genes, like RPWA,
needs to form a scaffold with a 14-3-3.
[SPEAKER_00]: TMV, the virus, is also requiring 14-3-3
interactions for signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jamlich's group showed that
another isoform actually is required to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was shown in rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of different ways
that these molecules could be contributing
[SPEAKER_00]: to immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set out to try to figure this
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a collaboration that we
actually did with Greg Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's at the Tel Aviv University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's Zoe, so on graduation day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know she's embarrassed, but I'm like her
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to embarrass her a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did I say Greg Martin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it was Greg's lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a connection.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll also talk about the work
that Jung and Kim had contributed to this
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we simply set out for really just
simple aims, which was to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: elucidating the roles of these 14-3-3s in
both pattern-triggered immunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also effector-triggered immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had the hypothesis that out of
Xanthomonas, if you had 40 effector genes,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many of those all, a few, are
targeting 14-3-3s as a node?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a brute force screen to
actually determine if it's just a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this an exception, or is this actually
a hotspot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we look at the phosphorylation
state of these effector complexes to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if a phosphorylation required for binding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, what is the requirement of
these complexes during infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll just highlight some of this
work moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that we're getting ready
to submit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that we asked,
because there's 12 isoforms of 14-3-3s in
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato, and they're listed here,
TFT1 through 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we simply wanted to ask, when are
these TFTs expressed during infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some of them induced and turned on
only during immune responses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we knock them down either using
viruses or stable knockdowns and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: their phenotypes are during the
Xanthomonas-tomato interaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also monitored ETI and
ethylene responses to see how this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important in the pathogen interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I should note we use a particular
strain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different than 8510.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a T3 race of Xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this effector gene, AVRXV3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we use this strain is
because we have strains with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: without.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to study the ability to turn on
resistance in an XV3 Hawaii-tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: background, so turning on our gene
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have strains that lack this
effector, so we can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see here is that if you look
at, we looked at 11 isoforms shown at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom, TFT1 through 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking simply at the induction of
the mRNA abundance for these isoforms over
[SPEAKER_00]: time in tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to show you that if you
look at mock in gray, I'll just use this
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example for TFT1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have XCV that's turning on PTI,
you see that TFT expression increases
[SPEAKER_00]: twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see now you have a larger
induction when you have ETI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see that where I have it
starred, these are showing that we can see
[SPEAKER_00]: significant increase or induction of these
TFT gene expression in response to ETI and
[SPEAKER_00]: PTI, but more robust during the ETI
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a little bit happy with this
because it kind of suggested that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: only some of these isoforms were involved
in the immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, when we went and silenced
them or stably knocked them down,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all seemed to be contributing at some
level to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we were looking at, if you focus
at day eight, this was a viral knockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the TRV vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is vector control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the pathogen is not
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing very well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of the isoforms that we had
silenced actually had at least a log or
[SPEAKER_00]: almost two logs increase the bacterial
titer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that they're more
susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were as susceptible as other
mutants that we know are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to knockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a little bit surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means they're all contributing at
some level to resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you take a look at the
phenotypes in terms of the pathology,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see in the vector control over
time and these are over several days,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see no symptom development here or a
few symptoms at this time point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was like day four or six.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you then see with TFT1, now you see
when you knock down this gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to see spot coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see various disease symptoms
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the take home so far for this is really
that all of these TFT isoforms seem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to ETI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not showing you the PTI data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've decided to do is actually
try to construct stable lines where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually knock out a subset of these and
really say, can we figure out which
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of these genes are really
critical for immunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that we're interested
in doing is we have many taglines of these
[SPEAKER_00]: TFTs because we want to actually purify
the complexes and not do a candidate
[SPEAKER_00]: approach, but actually let the plant tell
you who they're interacting with and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how the pathogen are targeting
these TFT protein complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's future work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question that we tried to get
at was which Xanthomonas effectors are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being targeted or targeting TFTs
within the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did a simple experiment,
which was just a complete profile of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 effectors that we had in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took the 11 isoforms of TFTs and we did
protein-protein interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked who comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found was it was only a
subset, but a significant subset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found eight effectors that
seemed to bind to many different 14-3-3
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought I'd just give you an example
of what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to us, it was kind of surprising
because, for example, this one protein
[SPEAKER_00]: called E1, if you look at the different
isoforms in a two-hybrid, you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for either growth or turning on the blue
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that, actually, it seems to
have significant binding to many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really good specificity,
but that might also tell us why many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these isoforms are required for the
infection condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back and we looked at this
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these are names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what was important was our initial
candidate that interacts with 14-3-3s came
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a positive control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found another protein that we have
been working on, ZopQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Guido has also found this other
protein called ZopAU.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep your eyes peeled for that because
this is the first identification he's
[SPEAKER_00]: shown that this is a kinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first bacterial effector kinase
that we've seen that's working in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to be targeting 14-3-3
complexes that are required, we think,
[SPEAKER_00]: for ETI and PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has a very nice story on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we actually then wanted to do is say,
do these things actually interact in
[SPEAKER_00]: planta?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of yeast interaction
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's where Zoe came in on the project
where she actually was testing how these
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins were interacting with TFTs in
planta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we added one more to the list because
this auto activates the yeast system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very similar in sequence to
ZopE1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we included that in our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be the focus of the rest of
the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Zoe did is she started out doing a
bifluorescence complementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took the effector with a half of a GFP
tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took the TFTs, all of them,
and with a half a GFP tag and asked if
[SPEAKER_00]: they come together to get fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did that with all of the effectors
we had identified and all of the 11
[SPEAKER_00]: isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think she's a super
graduate student.
[SPEAKER_00]: She actually went through root force and
did all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is that with the
positive control, when you have ZopM and
[SPEAKER_00]: TFT1, you see in these mesophil cells,
epidermal layers, you can see the nice
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic localization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that ZopM is actually interacting
near the membrane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that pattern looks what we would
expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a negative control for ZopE2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually see some fluorescence,
but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's one isoform, TFT10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she could see nicely that it also
looked like it was more membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasmic localized, but not necessarily
in the nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had AVRBS2, which is a protein that
Brian Saskitz has been working on a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of our screen, but actually it
didn't actually show up, the validated
[SPEAKER_00]: implanta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Zoe, being a good student,
said, I don't really buy this bifact data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that maybe we should try something
else to actually confirm these
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so went about it doing another assay,
which is doing affinity purification
[SPEAKER_00]: assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of this screen, we started dropping
out AVRBS2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's a false positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that these three are definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, these proteins were not
being very well expressed in our bifact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a complication of the
assay, but also probably because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unstable proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't figured out a way to get
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried a little bit harder to do the
pulldowns and see if we could purify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is taking the effector,
putting a his tag on it, doing nickel
[SPEAKER_00]: affinity purification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pulling out the effector and
asking, does it come along with a TFT?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just focus your eyes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can walk you through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use a negative controlled dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can purify dust really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that there's no TFT that
is copurifying with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: AVRBS2 was the one that we could purify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out of our screen, but we still
don't have any evidence that it interacts
[SPEAKER_00]: with TFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, false positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: ZopE1, we can enrich for it a bit,
but we can also pull out that TFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a positive case.
[SPEAKER_00]: E2, actually could purify that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of complements the bifact
analysis where we can detect it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's purifying TFT10 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ZopO also, poorly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can purify some of it and then see its
interactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were quite satisfied that we
could at least see in these pulldowns good
[SPEAKER_00]: purification and co-precipitation with
TFTs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only showing one isoform, but we have
others that she's also looked at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing you can note is every
time she was doing these pulldowns,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd see these high molecular weight
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was quite suspicious that maybe
these could be ubiquitinated molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: that might lead to their instability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were trying to sort through what
they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she showed was that if you
actually take a look at these and you
[SPEAKER_00]: probe with anti-ubiquitin, you can see
that these TFT molecules are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitinated in the presence of these
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she set up the model thinking about
perhaps interaction with the effectors is
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting them to be ubiquitinated or to
stay ubiquitinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that leads eventually to their
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one way to shut off the system is
just to get rid of that molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what she then went on to do is then
ask well, can we come up with any evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: for why these are, are they
phosphorylated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is phosphorylation really the mechanism
for them to come together?
[SPEAKER_00]: So she purified his tag, proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: She digested them up and looked for
phosphopectides, did mass spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually did site directed
eutogenesis to show whether or not it
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the schematic for ZopE2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we nicely mapped using some software
what might be potential 14 through 3
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylation sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are called UO1 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because they have a
putative serine residue that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what actually she showed in her mass
spec profile was that she had a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorylated residues, serine here,
acrine here, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the major hotspots that seemed to be
coming out of the majority of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: this site as well as this site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So time was running out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wanted to do all the combinations,
but she just said, I'll just make a double
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant before I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she was probably interviewing at
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she made this mutation and this
mutation and asked, does it still bind?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she found was it reduced binding
significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't completely prevent it from
binding to the TFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's wild type effector binding to
this TFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the nice biofluorescence
complementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see here the double
mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not completely gone, but you can see
the reduced fluorescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it appears that phosphorylation is
important to get this complex together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're left with this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some ideas about the enzymatic
activity of E2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm waiting for a student to try
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least from Zoe's work, what she was
able to show is that when ZopE2 gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant cell, it's phosphorylated on a
number of sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows physical association with at
least one or two isoforms of TFTs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and particularly TFT10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we see ubiquination of this molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads to what we believe is
proteasomal degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still what we're left in, what are the
substrates, the natural substrates for
[SPEAKER_00]: these 1433s?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the plants in tow where
we're actually purifying these TFT
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes to get at the other signaling
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end of the day, what's the
role of these 1433s in the interaction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had a little bit of trouble with
this because it seems like deleting one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these 1433s doesn't really just seem to
inhibit bacterial growth or enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial growth significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did see is a change in symptom
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make hole punches to sample our
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here, hopefully
through these hole punches of sampling,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this wild type gives you this nice
chlorosis of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the bacteria are growing
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we see is when we start taking
out combinations of these factor
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules, especially in E2, we see that
the symptom development comes much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's within maybe a day sometimes,
and we see the leaves become very
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sign of ethylene that we observed
or salicylic acid building up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're now looking at how perhaps
these effectors are suppressing the
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone signaling in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not affecting titer so much,
but definitely disease symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's ongoing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so just to summarize this part,
what I showed you is that we have a handle
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit on some of the host proteins,
the TFT isoforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're required for both PTI and ETI.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small group, so not every
effector is targeting this node.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can then see commonalities of these
and other pathogens that have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: morphologs or homologs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that phosphorylation is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to anchor into these
scaffolding proteins is a key prerequisite
[SPEAKER_00]: to suppress their function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're looking at how they're being
turned over within the host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of a foray into looking at
the early steps of how this protein is
[SPEAKER_00]: working.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's by being a scaffold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also discovered that ZopD,
working very late, is an enzyme mimic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I became super fascinated with this
molecule because of the fact when you take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at its structure, it has what
appears to be eukaryotic features.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the early days,
in the early 2000s, we really didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what effectors were doing at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we realized right away was that
if you take a look at from N-terminus to
[SPEAKER_00]: C-terminus, the C-terminus of this
molecule is this sumo protease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a protease that's working on
the ubiquitin pathway, specifically the
[SPEAKER_00]: small ubiquitin-like modifier called sumo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this modification is often on
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets them dragged into the nucleus or
on transcription factors that control
[SPEAKER_00]: their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we thought right away, hm,
this pathogen molecule is not even clear
[SPEAKER_00]: of how it got that domain because bacteria
don't have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow, it's really using that domain
to manipulate signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we could see that it was
localized in plant nuclear foci using
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventimiana assays or stable transgenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we determined the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was worked on in Kim Morse's group to
show that we predicted it to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in fact, here's the true
crystal structure of the cysteine
[SPEAKER_00]: protease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that fold is really highly
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we also realized is that they had
an internal DNA binding domain and also an
[SPEAKER_00]: ear repressor motif.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a repressor motif that you
only find in plant transcriptional
[SPEAKER_00]: repressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find it in other bacterial
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are ethylene-associated
repressor motifs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought perhaps this had all the
equipment to get into the nucleus,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bind DNA, either specifically or
non-specifically, maybe interfere with
[SPEAKER_00]: some repressor complexes, and then maybe
work on transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we set up was really the idea
that it's going into manipulate host
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription, getting into the nucleus,
cutting off these modifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: and turning over transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, that was our dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took us a long time to find those
transcription factors and to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one way we did it was actually going
back to the pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The timing and the symptoms were really
critical for getting us there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we found early on when we
deleted this molecule from xanthanol was
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was a very interesting
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at wild-type infection,
I told you that ELC xanthomonas will grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to high titers, form these spots in the
chlorosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just take out this one protein
by day eight or so, you see that bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: are not growing to high titers,
but the leaves really look like they are
[SPEAKER_00]: symptomatic, but in a sense, are dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were confused by that for a
while, because this is not disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trying to fight off the pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is resistance at some level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the PTI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we know from our work,
we could think, well, perhaps that was
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene or hormone signaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quantified ethylene in these leaves
to see if there was higher concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: here than there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you quantify over a time course,
and what you're looking at here is just
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves that are infected with magnesium
chloride, wild-type pathogen, or Zop-D
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're looking for is over time,
remember in that six to eight hour window,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see is that the wild-type pathogen
is growing, but it's suppressing ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it continues to keep those ethylene
levels down, and then they start to creep
[SPEAKER_00]: up around day 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the Zop-D mutant, you start to see
the occurrence or the accumulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: ethylene much earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really seems that that symptom
development, the pathogen is just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep this down so that it can maintain
replication and spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But which transcription factors are
controlling this ethylene response?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not much known about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went to the leaves, and we said,
let's see if we can profile for RNAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would give us an indicator of which
transcription factors might be a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't go through all the detail of
this, but we looked at some of that Greg
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin's group who was looking at,
and we looked for things that were either
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced by xanthomonas or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here was one in particular that
I'll point out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is called IRF4.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that wounding will induce the
accumulation of this transcript.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that xanthomonas highly
induces it, and so does Zop-D mutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really matter if you have
this effect or not, but this is responding
[SPEAKER_00]: to infection or to wounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went on to show that that was,
in fact, a direct target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't walk through this because this
is a few years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea was we actually had a new
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does clip off SUMO off a particular
lysine, lysine 53.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that simple removal of this molecule
leads to destabilization of this
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not complete loss, but a reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough of a reduction that it dampens
ethylene synthesis, and then ethylene
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis of ethylene-mediated defense
gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were quite excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, there were lots of
other people that were interested in other
[SPEAKER_00]: host targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we weren't the only one that was
finding transcription factors that were
[SPEAKER_00]: being regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could see that there was a MIB in
arabidopsis that was under the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: control of xanthomonas compestris
compestris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also see that there was a
DELLA transcription factor involved in GA
[SPEAKER_00]: hormone signaling in arabidopsis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for me to put my head around
which ones are the key targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those other systems, they didn't
show that SUMO-blation was really tied to
[SPEAKER_00]: the destabilization or the altering of
these transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible that ZopD has multiple
activities and multiple targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least in the tomato interaction,
it seems to be quite important for
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressing ethylene and suppressing SAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then how do plants respond to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're putting something in the
nucleus to alter gene expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were thinking we really want to
find resistance to ZopD to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: loads of actions of how to prepare against
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also thought perhaps even though
it's repressing transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might also be activating some modules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could essentially activate
things to promote infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen this in other xanthomonas
pepper interactions where TALF factors are
[SPEAKER_00]: really important for cell expansion and
forming pustules in the symptom
[SPEAKER_00]: development in pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've started to think about how to
profile for transcription factors,
[SPEAKER_00]: novel ones that no one had studied before
that might be dynamically regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a subset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we call these DH, for ZopD,
post-induced genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these turn out to be a particular
class of transcription factors called
[SPEAKER_00]: BHLHs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basic helic transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we realized, these types of
transcription factors are mostly linked to
[SPEAKER_00]: development and developmental regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were fascinated by that because
when you take a look at this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that this one has increased a
thousand fold during infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happening within hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to 12 hours we're seeing this ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for wild type strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get rid of all the effectors,
you see that it is not induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is effector dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see another example of the
opposite where wild type is keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of this gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that this one is without
effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is highly expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't talk about this one today,
but when you knock this one out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see that it's a negative regulator of
immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when plants lacking DH4 are actually
more resistant to xanthomonas infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got really interested in studying
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to tell you a little bit about
our early work on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still lots of work ahead,
but getting at host targets and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what they do in the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why BHLHs?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the literature, what we realized more
and more that there's crosstalk between
[SPEAKER_00]: different pathways, whether you're looking
at multiple hormone pathways, how they
[SPEAKER_00]: control each other, or if you're looking
at post-pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last few years, a hot topic was
really looking at how flagellin signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: through FLS2 crosstalks with the
brassinosteroid pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point of showing you is that part
of the crosstalk is down here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nucleus, and that's being mediated by BHLH
transcription factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was one question that was
left open, is xanthomonas is inducing
[SPEAKER_00]: these differentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could these be regulators mediating
crosstalk between growth and development?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we explored that idea, and what we
found was that we were going to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: this one that is highly induced and highly
regulated in the direction of upregulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what happens when we knock it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see here, and I wanted to point
out the importance of ZopD in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process, is that if you actually look
early at three hours, we see that this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene is not turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at six hours, notice this is
mock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is magnesium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcript is highly induced by
xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get rid of ZopD, you reduce
that almost down to 300 units.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This relative expression still is an
induced gene, but most of that inducing
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction is due to ZopD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you actually get rid of the
factors, you see almost about the same
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this looks like it's a PTI-induced
gene, but also ZopD-induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have developed antibodies
to be able to recognize this protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that this transcript
abundance actually correlates with protein
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually want to be able to study
this protein and look where and what
[SPEAKER_00]: transcripts it's being regulating within
the host cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is relieved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see as much induction of this
protein when you get rid of ZopD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the plants use this DH1-VHLA
transcription factor for a defense program
[SPEAKER_00]: or a growth program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they at odds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here is we can
silence either stably with VIGs or,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, we've done VIGs, we've done
hairpins, we've done CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the phenotypes are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you knock out this gene, what you can
see, and not a closely related one that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not affected by that knockout,
you can see that the pathogen is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal gets up to 10 to the eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see increased growth of the
pathogen when we get rid of this
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can also see increased growth of
Xanthomonas ZopD, also a log increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth when you get rid of this VHLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be involved in immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also seems to be involved in symptom
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at nine days before we
can see the differential of the symptoms,
[SPEAKER_00]: the RNAi line is showing more symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were intrigued by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be involved in immunity,
but it's also seemingly involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's at odds, because usually
these are trade-offs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't sure how to think about it,
but actually if you look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: wild-type plants are growing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are definitely stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see shorter internodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see increased branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see broader leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see as much serration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the symptom development is quite
different on some of these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also thought, well, what about below
ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could the below ground structure of the
roots be impacting the above ground
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see is really that's where
this transcription factor seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: working potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really expressed in leaves,
not that much in stems, but highly induced
[SPEAKER_00]: in roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or highly expressed in the roots,
and can be induced further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were thinking about is maybe
this is a root-specific transcription
[SPEAKER_00]: factor playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pathogen is reprogramming this in
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are really interested in
understanding how is it being reprogrammed
[SPEAKER_00]: in the leaves, and what is that benefit to
the host-pathogen interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one insight when we were looking at
this root phenomenon is that, Ying Sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: a new graduate student in my lab,
has been actually looking below.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she has seen is that if you just sort
of quickly put tomato on filter paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she does the mass of these roots
versus the mass here, shown for the
[SPEAKER_00]: silence line, she can see really a
significant reduction in dry weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: these roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she did an interesting sort of
experiment where she wasn't, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was an experiment, but she forgot to
fertilize her plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you had healthily fertilized
plants, you could see a really good growth
[SPEAKER_00]: differential between the silence lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they were not fertilized,
you lost that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it suggested is perhaps maybe if
there is root acquisition of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see it too much if, let's say it
was a nutrient transporter, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If nutrients are plentiful, wild type will
beat out the silence line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's not much nutrients around,
the growth differential would not be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're exploring the idea that maybe
there could be some sort of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisition difference between these
silence lines and those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how that is impacted in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an overview of this is we kind of have
this new transcription factor family we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pretty good data that shows that
this is triggered in response to chitin,
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if you use xanthomonas or
pseudomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be a PTI-induced gene in
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that ZopD seems to be turning this
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it's because it's in the
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's messing up the transcription of
DH1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to explore the mechanisms of
how.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want a couple more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I brought this up might
be useful to the tomato community here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was we really wanted to understand
really how these genes are being
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found in the promoter of DH1
was that there's some interesting boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these cis-regulatory elements,
G-boxes, are more linked to developmental
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription binding sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: W-boxes are worky boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you find the worky transcription
factors are sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed to be a hot spot potentially
where ZopD could be altering those
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription complexes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what Jung and Kim did in the lab
was he made transgenic plants with
[SPEAKER_00]: different regions of this promoter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he nicely showed that this 1.5 region
is really important for xanthomonas and
[SPEAKER_00]: ZopD induction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really looks like these
cis-regulatory elements are really the
[SPEAKER_00]: link to activation of this gene in a
ZopD-dependent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And importantly, we can show that this is
also protease-dependent, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important, the simulation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a protease-dead
mutant, you can no longer induce this
[SPEAKER_00]: gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be that whatever
transcription factors or co-regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: that are at this promoter are most likely
going to be simulated and the targets of
[SPEAKER_00]: ZopD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we set out to actually do a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of a new NSF proposal is
actually to look at all the workies in
[SPEAKER_00]: TOMATO, to clone them out, to provide
resources so that you can then use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 150 or 80 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jung then has pretty much got all
of them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going through and testing in a
screen to see which ones are sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hot spots in these promoters and to
see if they're the target of our effectors
[SPEAKER_00]: or multiple effectors that we're using in
the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those could be resources to anybody
in the lab, please contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be happy to share those with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just like to finish with this part,
which is that we initially got into
[SPEAKER_00]: studying ZopD because it was a potent
suppressor of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had an interesting eukaryotic feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mimicking host enzymes that
normally regulate processes that control
[SPEAKER_00]: transcription factor stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then used that as a tool to ask,
what other things could ZopD be regulating
[SPEAKER_00]: during the infection?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brought us to some developmental
genes that we think are playing a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the plant, some that
are being controlled by the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some that are normally being
controlled simply by development that
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'll go through that since I
just said the conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd just like to finish by just saying
that our contribution thus far was really
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to understand how xanthomonas
effectors like ZopD use different folds or
[SPEAKER_00]: endometrial enzymatic mimics to regulate
the initial immune responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're very interested in
identifying resistance to both xanthomonas
[SPEAKER_00]: and ZopD in different tomato lines or tepa
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to acknowledge my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of this work was done in
collaboration with a number of folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jeong-Gun Kim is a senior research
associate in my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs pretty much all of the projects
but has worked well with many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: students.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Zoe did all the effectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ying-Sung is working on the DH1 in the
root story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you for your attention.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone want to turn it again?
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant you're using towards the end
here, you were knocking out the 1G and the
[SPEAKER_02]: big, you know, the stunting plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fresh market tomato, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: DF36?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a processing tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that control is DF36, that's
interesting because processing tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have the apical commas of fresh
market tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like a fresh market tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time it gets that tall,
it should have laterals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean lateral roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you find when you grow like an N82 or
something like that, if the plant is this
[SPEAKER_02]: big out of a pot, the side branches will
be this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're seeing in your stunting plants
is actually more of the typical processing
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato growth habit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't consider it so much a stunting
as a different form of development,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a processing tomato standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: N82 is one of these tomato backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some of that and grow it and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most processing tomatoes are like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a lot that's known about the
regulation of apical dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you get that, I wouldn't be
surprised if there was a timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a fresh market tomato, most of the
standard ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's a great suggestion because what
we've seen when we make transgenic or
[SPEAKER_00]: rabidopsis is that we see an impact on the
stem formation and also the emergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lateral buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also quite a few genes that are
known that affect the length of the
[SPEAKER_02]: interoes, like sp5 and things like that,
into tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to the degree that what you're
doing is affecting development,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can tie into a fairly large amount of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an area that I don't know
much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a lot of ZopD questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good ones, I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like the DH family hypothesis
you have now is that ZopD is interacting
[SPEAKER_03]: with the transcriptional factors that are
driving this DH family.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an alternative hypothesis that
it's repressing a repressor that has all
[SPEAKER_03]: these in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's secondary.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all secondary genes that are
coming up as you repress that repressor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is sort of which is the
target and which is a consequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: action, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least for the timing of this,
this gene comes up very quickly within
[SPEAKER_00]: three to six hours in terms of at least
that's the earliest transcript that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see coming up 1,000 fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't say that that's a primary
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I can tell you is
that we've looked for the alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothesis, which is oftentimes you'll see
upregulation of the transcript if it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if DH1 is a target of ZopD,
right, and you remove that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you essentially could positively
activate transcription of DH1 to get more
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're exploring that possibility,
right, that it is the target, a target
[SPEAKER_00]: where DH1 is functioning at multiple
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's a likely scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of deals with this idea that
maybe that, you know, it's just a reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: for us telling us which genes are being
dynamically regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is what's happening to the
tighter of Xanthomonas when you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: wild type versus ZopD?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look in the early stages,
with Xanthomonas we see a rapid increase
[SPEAKER_00]: two to four days, and then it kind of
comes up to eight and then it levels off
[SPEAKER_00]: where you get saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at ZopD, it kind of,
two to four days, it's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we start to see things where
ethylene is being produced in salicylic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, that's when we start to see ZopD
can't grow anymore and wild type keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that phenotype correlates with
reporters that we are seeing at the four
[SPEAKER_00]: day stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen bacterial growth
differences for Xanthomonas effector
[SPEAKER_00]: mutants earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually it's something that I'm highly
interested in because I can't find a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant that breaks that down to say day
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks like when you delete one or
more of those, we see chlorosis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf occurring, but bacterial titer stays
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't done those experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could certainly do that, just putting
them in a more induced promoter in
[SPEAKER_00]: Xanthomonas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't done those experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea to thinking about how that
might suppress symptom development more
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively during infection, is that what
you're thinking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: If we mutate more than one, it's more
faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than one ZopD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question is that, ZopD1 have a
marriage formation, but ZopD2,
no.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: A question is that, is that the ZopD1 have
defect on the folic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is really who's
manipulating whom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you brought up a nice point that some
of these effector molecules have lipids on
[SPEAKER_00]: them and tether them to different
compartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two that I had talked about,
one seems to tether to the membrane and
[SPEAKER_00]: one is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both seem to be interacting with
1433s in the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know at this stage who's
controlling who.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say is that the 1433s are
required to signal for PTI and ETI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it suggests that the effectors are
trying to interfere with the complexes
[SPEAKER_00]: that those molecules are interacting with.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
