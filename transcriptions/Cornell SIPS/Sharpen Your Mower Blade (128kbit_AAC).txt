[SPEAKER_00]: Your mower blade needs to be sharp so that
you're getting a clean slice of the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: blade which then minimizes stress to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant uses less water but more
importantly a dull blade increases your
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel consumption 20 to 30 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have access to a workbench
a small table will work fine and your
[SPEAKER_01]: basic seat clamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I'm sharpening the blade won't
move around on me it'll make it a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to keep the same edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you want to check for when
you're inspecting these blades are large
[SPEAKER_01]: dings or major scratching pitting on the
front of the blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to look for when a blade is
pretty much on its last legs you'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: crack starting to form right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that happens that means you have a
compromised blade it's beyond the point of
[SPEAKER_01]: sharpening it you should replace it so
nothing bad happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use two hands when I'm using a
file not to apply pressure you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: using a lot of pressure when you're
operating file you're just letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: tool do its work you're just guiding it
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that I'm really not pushing
this down at all other than to keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: flat on the blade.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a single edge file meaning it only
has grooves in one direction so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: only move in one direction which is always
away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing you want to stay away from is
rolling your hands when you're running a
[SPEAKER_01]: file you're going to round the edge of
this blade and that's not going to do you
[SPEAKER_01]: any good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to make it worse so
try to stay keep it flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have major dings in the blade on
the front edge it may not be a wasted
[SPEAKER_01]: blade you can still use it but you are
going to want to file that edge down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to wear a glove just in case I
slide off when I'm filing that I don't cut
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that I'm always moving away
from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a small balance it's under ten
dollars it's something you can find at
[SPEAKER_01]: your basic hardware store lawn and garden
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our mounting hole your center
screw that holds the blade in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use this hole to set on top of the
balancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The balancer has ridges on it to
accommodate for multiple sizes of main
[SPEAKER_01]: center holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually lightened up this side we
haven't lightened up this side yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not balanced it's going to wobble
when it spins that's going to add to wear
[SPEAKER_01]: and tear to your blades.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to add to streaking and
your cutting it's going to give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: uneven cut when your blades aren't
balanced properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the blade comes out of balance where
you take more metal off of one end than
[SPEAKER_00]: the other that can also affect fuel
consumption and the quality of cut you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're putting them back in you can
essentially tighten it up by hand almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to over tighten it because you got
to get it off at some point.
