[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope here to lightly touch on a number
of areas where animals and soils interact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a comprehensive thing that has
to go from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's areas that are of interest,
then stop the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think seminars ought to be more
interactive than they usually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will throw some things out,
some ideas for a few minutes, to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get the juices rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always liked standing on soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wash a lot out of the clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took soil science from Dr. Muns and
Delwich at UC Davis years and years ago in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoagland Hall, named after the man who had
a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delwich, interesting, Dr. Delwich's twin
was a professor of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also learned about soils and range
management and pasture management,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing, courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'll mention here, I've run into
working with soils off and on over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years, often brought home to me by just
dumb mistakes I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the lessons you remember the
best and most important to pass along.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make things relevant, I always like to
look in the papers, see if there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: stories out there related to, in this
case, to plant nutrition or animals or
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't disappointed this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was an incident further up the lake
where a large dairy, which stores a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: manure in the winter, they're trying to
get away from spreading manure on snow and
[SPEAKER_00]: then having it all wash away into the
creeks in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very large dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they built a second storage and
containment unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they transfer to the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some kind of structure
that transfers to the second, which
[SPEAKER_00]: failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to fall back on spreading on the
snow, which is not a great way to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, after a few months on the
snow, some of the nutrients work down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it rained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all ran away from them and wound up
in Cayuga Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, these are clowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people who are making
conscientious effort to do nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come up against, as you get bigger
and bigger and more and more concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, it becomes a very difficult
problem to address it at any cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to worry about algal blooms in
Lake Erie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cleared up for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the last five years or so,
they've popped back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limiting nutrients from Ohio farms and
probably some other farms upstream as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, Indiana and so on, made its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's restarted the eutrophication
issues that you have out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of you are familiar with that
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if an oversupply of some limiting
nutrients, sometimes it's nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is limiting the growth of algae
in a body of water will allow algae to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow faster and more fully than otherwise,
which is nasty enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these algaes are also release
toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the southeast coast, we've had cases
with manure spills that have resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in organisms that release toxic
materials that affect the life there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody lives forever, including algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they die and decay, they deplete
the oxygen, which makes the fish sad
[SPEAKER_00]: because they call their gills for oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they get is a busy signal,
and then they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something to look out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also is happening in China as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in California, after years and years,
this is specifically, these reports are
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinas Valley to Larry Basin,
which looks like it's in the San Joaquin
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the map, it's kind of over
a rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in San Joaquin Valley proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other places in California
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years and years of nutrient depletion
management or mismanagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these soils are very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of sand in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the warm weather and the
irrigation and the small amount of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter to begin with, which disappears
pretty quickly, farming in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soils in California is more like
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting in the amendments and it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has really come back to haunt
people in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like these nitrate problems
in the groundwater and the aquifers are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to worsen in several decades,
no matter what we do, because some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates hitting the water supply,
the drinking water supply now,
[SPEAKER_00]: started on their way down there 10 or 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we need to do something,
but it's quite an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that other regions would do well
to get ahead of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agricultural fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In animal waste and a lot of those
agricultural fertilizers are going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, which are used for animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other sources that can be locally
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have processing plants
that process massive amounts of milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of whey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you do with the whey?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go put on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you put on enough land,
then it can be incorporated back properly
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's all fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the number of years ago,
about 10 years ago, they found some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that were dumping their entire whey stream
on eight acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't work out too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other things that can be
locally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to do remediation once all
this stuff is in the groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that they suggested is just pump
that wonderful water, call it fertigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't apply any nitrogen except with
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least it's not out of the soil,
but at least it's circulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's circulating back near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are issues that we'll have to
solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very often, the people solving them
may not be the ones that put the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of other things that
they suggest doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in terms of sustainability,
you've probably heard all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use the term through here,
I might be using it in any of three
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the one that came up from many
committees in the 20th century that
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable agriculture is environmentally
sound, economically feasible, socially
[SPEAKER_00]: just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that sound like it was from a
committee?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: In each one of those, we can deconstruct.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our courses, since I'm a nutritional
toxicologist, we say the sustainable ag
[SPEAKER_00]: conserves nutrients without concentrating
toxicants by procedures robust enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: withstand social and economic change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So systems of management that are setting
up a sustainable system need to be useful
[SPEAKER_00]: in a number of different economic,
sociological, political settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you switch from democracy to fascism
for a while, it shouldn't have any impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on the groundwater if you've chosen your
management methods carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Liberty High Bailey was much more
proactive, much more activist,
[SPEAKER_00]: and much more forward looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, heck with the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: His famous quote on the subject is,
the productiveness of the earth must
[SPEAKER_00]: increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: From generation to generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I teach a number of courses,
we talk about many things the animals
[SPEAKER_00]: provide us and things we provide for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to stick to some most
relevant to soils today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lateral vertical transfer of nutrients
is incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a number of people in the
department that have worked on that over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of nutrients being moved
vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They provide draft transport for
distribution of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital accumulation, in case you've got a
soil related project.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banks aren't usually worth much,
but you can go sell some animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversion of human and edible resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the land with soil that we use for
our agricultural systems are not tilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're grazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than half of the earth's land
surface, at one time or another,
[SPEAKER_00]: gets used that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great alternative to
composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few other things here we could
talk about if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of lateral vertical transfer of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals graze and browse a lot more area
than can be cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the comparisons you may have read
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better, confinement animal or
grazing animal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on how you do it,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of silly exercises.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very often, there's an implicit
assumption underlying the comparisons that
[SPEAKER_00]: the grazing and the grazing of row crops
that are going to the animals are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to do that comparison only on
steep hillsides or rocky areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: places poorly drained, there'd be no
comparison because there'd be no corn or
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you tried it, it would wreck the
resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, that's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as a number of you probably learned
in soil science classes, I only took the
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the browse and perennial forage
species, even some of the herbaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: species, especially if it's been
established for years and years and years
[SPEAKER_00]: and years, they have deep and extensive
root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dense, very deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this area, we don't think of Ithaca as
a tropical area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good because it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go out there in the woods and
so on or places that have been cleared,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the soils are fairly well
developed near the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: They certainly don't have the full
complement of cations and useful trace
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals that the parent rock did or you
find in other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this can be handy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, for millennia, trees were
bringing up nutrients from underground and
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early farmers here used a lot of that
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this broad range of nutrients can be
brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals will browse on either woody
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very deep roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been there a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or on pastures or long tap-rooted legume
species, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can actually deliver and
distribute those trace minerals to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is night folding or bringing
them into a boma, a crawl, or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring the animals in at night,
collect that manure, and then you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: it locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some different examples I can think of of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 80s and 90s, I was involved in
what's called a small ruminant criss
[SPEAKER_00]: program that did research on llamas and
sheep and goats and all that sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in an international setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you remember the criss programs,
and I call them the PMIL programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are funded by USAID and usually
involve American universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was my point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, went to a meeting in about 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a sociology division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grad students that go out and
actually do the work for this program went
[SPEAKER_00]: out thinking, well, if we just get rid of
the animals, they wouldn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: starvation here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the first questions they asked
when they got to the Antipano and
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of Peru was, why do you
raise sheep?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, why raise sheep?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can grow food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go to the market,
and there's people running around with
[SPEAKER_00]: little bags of sheep pellets selling to
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even some of those famous raised bed
little places where they grow potatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of things, those were fertilized
historically by llamas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alpacas and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the Spanish wiped those out or
reduced them greatly and replaced them
[SPEAKER_00]: with sheep, they continue with sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this lateral transfer, the ability
to bring nutrients horizontally across
[SPEAKER_00]: land has been part of sustaining the soils
and sustaining the productivity in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some others, you can goof that up
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But East Africa during the colonial
period, remember this is before Haber
[SPEAKER_00]: process, nitrogen is readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we had these huge globalist
transfers of nutrients from continent to
[SPEAKER_00]: continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some, but mostly people worked
with what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people from East Africa,
including colonists, would send livestock
[SPEAKER_00]: out pretty wide, bring them back home,
and build the soils locally with
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and so on to make them more
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, two mistakes done and soil
lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked in Western Kenya for a while and
we were working with dual purpose goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had goats which would give milk and the
young would provide meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was thought to be a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, eventually it's discovered that the
most important contribution to the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: food chain, the whole food system was not
necessarily the meat or the milk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did help and there are children
alive because they got some milk from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest contribution to the whole
deal was through the manure onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the soils in our area were about
4.6 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanted to run out with a copper
rod and a zinc rod and see if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: light something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were some legumes you really
weren't going to do too well with,
[SPEAKER_00]: like alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Rift Valley, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over there in Navajo, they had a great
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every expert that came to talk to us
said, you should be planting alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_00]: all from the Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should plant alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agronomist on the project finally got
tired of it and she grew a little plot of
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa and it would get about that tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it her alfalfa bonsai plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when somebody came and says,
why aren't you growing alfalfa?
[SPEAKER_00]: She could grab them by the collar,
drag them over and go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cheap education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the mistake I made there was we were
doing digestion trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing a lot of feeding trials and
really wanted to know how the animals were
[SPEAKER_00]: handling and transferring nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process of that, we had to
train the animals to get on the milking
[SPEAKER_00]: stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, we were using East African
goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had some cross-breds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought a load of Togaber goats up
from the coast from an old colonial
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got them going and milking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to train them, I didn't want to put a
bunch of grain on there because it would
[SPEAKER_00]: goof up our calculations for digestibility
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, I know why they'll train and come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just take a little pinch to trace
mineral salt up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that were milking milked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they decided they would keep doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did the experiments with the manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a year, it seems like the manure
didn't help the crops at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what we were planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't until we left and they quit
putting the mineral salt for training the
[SPEAKER_00]: animals that all of a sudden, the Kenyans
who took over, good researchers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they found tremendous impact of the
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What had happened, as you all know,
is that it didn't do my math too well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is a pinch?
[SPEAKER_00]: It added up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the manure went out to the
field, it had enough salt to really foul
[SPEAKER_00]: up its agronomic value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, the Kenyans figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the greatest things
that goat project provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: The milk was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good in tea, meat once in a while
for a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by streaming those nutrients,
the organic matter, the micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything through without the salt,
it had a great and positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indonesia, they'll keep sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe sometimes goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Finet, you may have seen these with the
bamboo or eucalyptus sticks kind of in an
[SPEAKER_00]: elevated cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the manure drops down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can pick that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can put it where they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's dropping down into a pond
where they're raising fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're fertilizing the pond to grow
plant materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever their fish are that they're
eating it can take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens in the US as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, there was such an awareness on
animal farms through the 19th century into
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 20th century of what exactly the
animals needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they really were providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when they shifted from a system where
they were separating the cream on the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, making butter, you're sending out
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buttermilk and the skim milk was
slopped to hogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manure went back on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just put on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they said, hey, we'll buy your
milk, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to do stuff with it over
here in this factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of farmers says, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is before you could buy a
lot of nitrate fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were depending upon nitrogen from
rains, maybe a little tiny bit of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a thunder, snow, they go out and
plow it down to try to keep the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very, plus all the other
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very concerned that over
time that they would lose these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: as milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would compromise what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the level of awareness as you
develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't have a lot of alternatives
for fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk about another one in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of draft, the animals also
interact with the soil in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People use draft for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cost much in capital outlay
relative to tractors, especially on
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the local fuel, feed, and
byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make the equipment, make the
harnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lump of metal or a little
foundry out back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bang a plowshare, maresha,
wherever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing with spare parts and
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: In contrast to tractors, which require
large capital outlay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're often made overseas if you're in
some countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment, the maintenance can be
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The parts can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess some of the tractor companies
now are not letting you maintain your own
[SPEAKER_00]: tractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's become a thing in
Africa yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly has here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing with the horses,
is that if you've ever, how many of you
[SPEAKER_00]: have been on the farm that only used
horses?
[SPEAKER_00]: You walked around the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it feel like when you're walking
around on the soil relative to a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that's plowed with tractors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you notice the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Softer, a little more springy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has what, it has tilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has loft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're converting a lot of those
higher carbon compounds into higher
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen carbon ratio or lower carbon
nitrogen ratio compounds as they defecate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it increases the amount of acreage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tillable relative to hand labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use the animal for a number of
different purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a interaction that we've
studied some, but mostly in the teaching
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transport, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need soil amendments, if you need
to get your market more than walking
[SPEAKER_00]: distance, from where you are, very often
animals are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There aren't roads to everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a place like Ethiopia, if you
visit, you're probably spending most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your time on roads or maybe dirt tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is the skin of the onion with
regard to where people are, where things
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown, where animals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it in these countries is going by
beasts of burden, both inputs in and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to have an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have an impact on the
environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this is just for soils,
but also animals represent capital
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get ahead and you don't need to
sell the animal the right way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep them to a different season or
a different year and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So banking services historically have not
been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess with the cell phones now,
they're coming up with new ways of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very often, the bank wouldn't let
small farmers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a guy thrown out of a Barclays bank
in 1982, because he just wasn't of the
[SPEAKER_00]: class that was allowed to have banking
services.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's an alternative to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go ask them, hey, do this
improvement in soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a composting system here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll invest in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not going to go to the bank,
because they wouldn't let them in,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if they went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inflation is such that sometimes a decimal
point on the exchange rate is just a blur
[SPEAKER_00]: going by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go to their bank of animals in
many of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the animals convert massive
amounts of human and edible resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: both to food and to manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rangeland pasture and both marginal
non-arable land are out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they can convert byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've never really got my
head around, is why when the prices of
[SPEAKER_00]: soybeans and corn go so high, people keep
feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're all cornered and under
entrust or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing up in Northern California,
there were feedlots there that didn't feed
[SPEAKER_00]: any grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I moved here in 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody fed any soybean to anything but a
chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was brought in, because they
don't grow soybeans in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be a lot more of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So animals are going to be critical to the
delivery of nutrients to human population,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you don't eat them or eat their
eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in these systems, eating the
animals is the least imaginative and
[SPEAKER_00]: useful thing that you can do, because they
have all these other services involving
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving and delivering nutrients to the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another issue that I think is
important especially with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, especially in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a disaggregation of the
nutrient cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where there's a geographical
separation of nutrient sources and where
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, dairy operations by massive
quantities of alfalfa hay from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Imperial Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds and hundreds of miles north feed
it to the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they take the manure back to the
Imperial Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they have a surplus there to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of dairy farmers that just
grow corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it is a forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it in silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of their other feeds are
purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not grow anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a significant number of
animals and you don't have enough land to
[SPEAKER_00]: reincorporate those nutrients and then use
those, you can have fudge factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have allowable efficiency margins
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no matter how you do the math,
slice it or dice it, you're piling a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients into a small area,
partially because of disaggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a net transfer of nutrients and
accumulation of nutrients or pollution
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen this go the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People dependent upon importing nutrients
can get in the bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came here in 94, 95,
somewhere in there, I went to visit a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: because they wanted me to go out and look
for poison plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're a bunch of cattle from the farm
had shown up at the vet school with bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: jaw, which is edema of the jaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually an indication of a protein
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you're taught to memorize in vet
school that it's also an indication of
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitism that's taken away the protein
and albumin and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they thought it was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, well, maybe it's a poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went on every inch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found no poison in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found no poisonous plants, which is
weird, because there's tons of poisonous
[SPEAKER_00]: plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I didn't find was
anything on the farm, no hay, no forage,
[SPEAKER_00]: no silage, nothing that had more than
about 9% or 10% crude protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were big whole scenes being
milked like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, well, couldn't get some
cottonseed meal because I just came from
[SPEAKER_00]: California, or soybean meal because I was
starting to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, no, no, our suppliers ran out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran out of soybeans in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, the rules on organic
changed for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, he would have had to just
given up the premium entirely if he were
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring in non-organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you can get a nutrient
deficit with mismanagement as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just excess and pollution.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting papers in this was
written in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was published in Science that looked at
disaggregation on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil was starting to produce a lot of
soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these solved the aluminum problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just exporting tons to
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what did they do with that nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some parts of China that
use too much nitrogen as fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together with this, there was no way
to make that round trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: My one soil science experiment,
I got to talk about it because it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only thing I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the term science loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was at UC Davis, I had a student
want to do an undergraduate project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at the impact of farming on
land, he said, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we found a field that had been in
Sugar Beets, for years and years and
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was divided into three parts in
1956.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part was a crop field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grew crops in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part was a pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a small sheep facility nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would pasture the sheep there,
all irrigated, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in between was a laneway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was from the original soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was capped with decomposed granite and
sealed pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we go, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got three treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a permanent pasture that's been
continuously used for 37 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a field that's been cropped for 37
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can drill soil tube down through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can find out what was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shouldn't have changed much in all
of those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found out how it was managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no manure spread on this land
the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the department had a manure spreader.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had never put manure in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used it as a wagon to carry things
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'd paint it green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd have it in the picnic day
parade, which is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they never used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because manure is yucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, you know, you don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what were they doing with the manure
for 37 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: This really blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd been there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my grandfather went there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I knew the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taking all the manure from the
animal units and burying it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: landfill over gravel next to Pewter Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to me, that wasn't real good nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd only taken the one in the soil
science class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also found that for the field,
there was actually records of every crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much was harvested, what its nutrient
composition was, everything, in sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the archives in the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go, oh, boy, we can do this two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can measure what's left relative to the
laneway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can estimate how many tons
they took out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally, they put nitrogen on it,
inorganic nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to help them plant and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went out there and took soil samples
at three deaths, 21 sites, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these beginner soil science things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that from the crop field over
the years, this was a control,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of calcium in there had gone
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of magnesium had gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus has gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is per thousand grams or per liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're used to per hundred,
then it's going to look weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pasture, on the other hand,
maintained most of their calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their magnesium, and pretty much
all of their phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was all irrigated.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were all sandy loams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium wasn't hanging around for
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was, that just happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did it on the basis of what they
were taken out, these are metric tons from
[SPEAKER_00]: a seven-hectare field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they were, they'd exported
over that 37 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I mean by disaggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we buy nutrients from the Midwest and
bring it here, not only do they carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gas burden of their production
there with inorganic paper process
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen made from natural gas with the
tendons, losses of methane and CO2 and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the burden from transfers, not only
does it have all of that, between those
[SPEAKER_00]: four levels, fertilizers, feed brought in
and such, we end up with a situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: we have too much nutrients on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, integrated systems, a little less
degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If animals are fed feeds that are grown
right near them, where they're used feed
[SPEAKER_00]: and bedding, as we call manure,
are efficiently incorporated into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some soil and feed supplements will
probably need to be imported.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chronic and just outstanding
micronutrient deficiencies here in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York, especially up along the ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't, you don't have to bring in
much more than you put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's inefficiencies we'll talk
about in a second, but systems often
[SPEAKER_00]: include grazing, which is the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low, very low fossil fuel content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals pick up the feed, they
distribute nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, there's some nitrogen loss of
volatilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the carbon loss tends to be
the CO2, not so much the methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these are some,
these are things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's New York dairy farms that do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With high disaggregation, you have a large
number of animals that are fed entirely on
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of a chicken house.
[SPEAKER_00]: From sources that are way too far away
from incorporation of manure or nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holdings that they have, the land may
or may not be inadequate to cycle it back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then where does the nutrients come
with the crop that comes up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going into the chickens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going someplace else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you end up doing things like
shipping soybeans and other feeds across
[SPEAKER_00]: continents and across oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The panhandle southeastern swine feeding
operations in the Texas and Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: panhandles, grown a lot of that stuff
nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being imported in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may spread it on the land,
but most of it's going in the air or over
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast happens as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poultry operations, and we mentioned
processing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of dairy farms that do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lament that they don't have enough
land to, you know, to score a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interpretation of that that's less
popular in my department is, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe you have too many animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't go over big at meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did this happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we've promoted purchase
ingredients a lot for animals to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: burdens on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, way back when it says,
you know, be modern, feed formula feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep trying to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has become a big deal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if you're looking at the
confinement feeding, being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: formulate, modify and formulate feeds to
minimize the amount of surplus nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: going through the animals makes a lot of
sense if that's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them, they get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can actually get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sunnyside up here, they invested
heavily to make sure that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: containing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we've lost, we have price
differentials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very often, homegrown feeds in terms of
your time and the money and the investment
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and all of this may be more
expensive than stuff that's trucked in out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Ohio or Iowa.
[SPEAKER_00]: To you, the price, not the cost to the
whole system, but the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although sometimes that's reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an organic farm and you're
getting, you know, $42 per hundred weight
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than whatever the heck it is now,
18 for conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to have, you want to either
grow your stuff organically or purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most organic farmers, the supply
of organic feeds can be unreliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, they can grow the feeds and it
may cost them more to grow their own feeds
[SPEAKER_00]: than if they bought it from cargo or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may cost them more to grow those feeds
than if they were growing conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds, but not that much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmers still have the skills to
grow a lot of these concentrate feeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can use those and their input is
cheaper than trying to go out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market and buy organically grown stuff
from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of, I have a lot of, you know,
problems with organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is they're not really explicit about
nutrient balance on the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But accidentally, through this,
the nutrient balance in organic farms
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be closer to zero than it is on
conventional ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for anything to do with organic
itself, but the fact that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: heck, they can grow their feeds cheaper
than what they can buy, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reverse situation for a lot of
conventional farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I take a lot more time than I
thought I was with my few ideas here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things we can do is co-locate more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would help the soil sciences are
trying to help the farmers sort out what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use more sustainable sources of organic
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by organic, I don't mean organic in
the legal sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean things with carbon, carbon-carbon,
carbon-hydrogen bond type of inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be stuck bringing in selenium and
cobalt and a few things in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not a big deal, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grazing can be more prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This state and many states have a lot more
grazing capabilities than we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one time or another, about 61% of the
dry land surface in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has been grazed or browsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's pretty thin soup,
you know, out there in the desert and so
[SPEAKER_00]: on, but it's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are the edges of very productive
fields here or maybe the hillside above
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which you can put all the,
you know, fertilize everything you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your yields and that won't be that great,
and they're more erodible soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas you can sustain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pastoral systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grazing, as I teach a section in grazing,
I would love to teach a grazing range
[SPEAKER_00]: management pasture management class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think one exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about grazing is potentially
the most sustainable of all food systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: more sustainable than any cropping system
you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially it is the least
sustainable of all food systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the moonscapes that you see in
the Aegean Sea, some of the islands there
[SPEAKER_00]: in Greece, you can see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it in different parts of the
world, some of the upper slopes in Haiti,
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can screw that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so much in production systems,
it's how you do it is more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important than what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I say historical record in
case mixed success, that is really an
[SPEAKER_00]: understatement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have destroyed a lot of our food
producing capability in this world by not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing grazing correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can straighten me out where I've
screwed up here, I'd appreciate that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm going to try to teach this to
my class in a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a lot of our farmers, young and
not so young, don't remember the skills to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant to bring this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got tons more slides than I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from Morrison's Feeds and Feeding,
1948.
[SPEAKER_00]: Written by the character they named our
building after, Morrison Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about this sense of nutrient
management that was just intuitive in
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they put it in dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like you said with your computer
program, he had tables where depending
[SPEAKER_00]: upon what concentrates, refuges,
animal products you got, they would,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is $19.48.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you went and bought the feed,
we think about, OK, it's going to meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those farmers also thought exactly how
many nutrient, how much fertilizer am I
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing if I import feed to my farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there were tables to calculate
that, which I guess is like you guys did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they calculated the fertility
value per ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the fertility value was
pretty substantial per ton purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was fertility, again,
in the environment where farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: there weren't as many inputs available as
there are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: The general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call him the general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he'd been a general in the
National Guard or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just did the labs when I took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other story in terms of nutrient
management in animals, you've probably
[SPEAKER_00]: read this if you know the local history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ithaca area in general, Danby in
particular, was a place where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: escaped slaves ran to or walked or rolled
or however they got here into this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them took up farming in Danby
near where my house is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where he learned to
practice or if he invented it or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by that point, late 1850s,
the trace mineral micronutrient content of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soils had been pretty well beat up out
of this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had cleared the trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they weren't getting that pump of
nutrients coming up anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were depleting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had burned all of the oaks for the
potash and shipped it out on the Erie
[SPEAKER_00]: Canal because potassium was a very
valuable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually burned it not just to
clear the land, but to have this valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: soil amendment that they could package and
send off.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the rest of New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people were having trouble with
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had the practice that somewhere he
got it where he would go and pick up every
[SPEAKER_00]: dead animal, every dead animal everywhere
in the county that he could get on his
[SPEAKER_00]: wagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would take it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd render it with lye, like the vet
school does when they digest all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: dead animals in hydroxides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he took that and he put it on the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It corrected the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brought micronutrients and nitrogen
and other things on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his crops were much better than his
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually had a more sustainable
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even dead animals can help the soil be
productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if people do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say something about losing skills
for grazing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, grazing is a complicated system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're managing mixtures of plants in
place, changing over time, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole one that if I got into the
grazing thing, not only do people need to
[SPEAKER_00]: change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, animal nutritionists are scared of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have a feed resource that changes
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes depending on how much they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silo's don't do that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, it can be very
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the animals need to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animals, that is a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes in their adult life,
they don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to eat as they were eating when
they were six to eight months of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way we raise calves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more conducive to TMR feed and that
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the animals need to learn to graze.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people need to learn to do the
grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where infrastructure for animal
nutrition needs to get their head around
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of universities have range
management, pasture management things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's here, too, in natural resources
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't run across it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'd love to do a grazing class.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if this disaggregation in these
decoupled nutrient cycles are the problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, part of it is the cost, as people
pointed out, of doing it disaggregated for
[SPEAKER_00]: the person who actually makes a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to grow fava beans for winter
crop, or do I want to just buy some
[SPEAKER_00]: cottons?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a California question, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the people making the decision,
just like you said, it depends upon the
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly are for up until recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were such direct subsidies for
growing certain crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really a big pasture subsidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, promotion that by, there isn't a lot
of profit margin that isn't available to
[SPEAKER_00]: companies who sell inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gone and you've really learned
how to do a pasture, it's going to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the solomons by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to reduce the concentrate feeds
that you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to reduce a lot of other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have not been too happy about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they funded white papers from people
to say, oh, pasture, it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's environmentally, it would be better
off doing confinement feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've read some of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do, as we said in one
slide, is to look at the farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the land somebody owns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, OK, how can I make some money
off of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I make it so I can keep doing it
for generations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of, a lot of people have just
been panicked into being essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding stations for feed companies,
where you buy in the stuff and you feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: to your animals, your chickens,
your pigs, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may not even ever have had the
land base they needed to produce the feed
[SPEAKER_00]: or to be able to incorporate what goes
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them are trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This state is so much better than other
states on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to infer because they had a
little accident up the lake that were a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of screwballs in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people were busting their financial
metaphorical derrières trying to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are states that are much worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're familiar with the Chesapeake Bay
or the Chesapeake Watershed Authority,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're trying to control the amount
of sediments and nutrients going down,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania and Maryland shed a lot more
nutrients than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, they depend on our
clean water coming from our forests and
[SPEAKER_00]: farms into the Susquehanna to go down into
Delaware.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go down and rinse out the rest of the
watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was an early recognition of
these issues because in Delaware County
[SPEAKER_00]: and other places there were watersheds for
New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used surface water without treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started filling with that years
and years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it became more important generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York was way ahead of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had in place, not that everybody does
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember driving by a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while there was a subsidy for
fencing to fence off riparian habitats
[SPEAKER_00]: along the creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one side of the road was one farm
and they'd fence off the riparian habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a pipe going from the creek
to a water trough that was out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: animal field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't have to go down to the
creek to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other person built the same fence and
used it to confine the animals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: riparian habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a moonscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like...
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this depends on how you go
about it, even with the same policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to answer your question, I think more
co-location and more integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get both sides of controversy here
thinking about, oh, I don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe I have too many animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can think both sides of that and
make adjustments there, I think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: make the...
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't make the problem easy,
but you make the problem simpler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of policies, including federal
policies, have run against this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was here in the 70s as a grad
student, farmers were able to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they got it free or they
got it so subsidized because you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, phosphorus is good and we need it to
support legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they had this tremendous subsidy
for phosphates for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, it's cheap,
it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a little response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people just buy it, put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy it, put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still draining the phosphorus off of
those lands that probably didn't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be put there in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, seemed like a good policy on
some level, but didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can, you know, I think co-location
would be a good start and improving
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm not a
grazing fanatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it can be done well, it can be
done wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could also establish policies that
make it worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the phosphate subsidy wasn't too
bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe someplace in country it was,
but farms long abandoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're gone back to forest and
brush over in Tompkins Schuyler County
[SPEAKER_00]: over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still draining.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still got a lot of phosphorus here
because it seemed like a good idea at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've run out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's thank Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at Cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
