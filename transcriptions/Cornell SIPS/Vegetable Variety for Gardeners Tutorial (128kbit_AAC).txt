[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get to the Vegetable Varieties for
Gardeners website, you go to gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: .cornell.edu or gardening.cals.cornell
.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the main page of
garden-based learning at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Citizen Science, I'm going to
scroll down on this page, you see we have
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable Varieties for Gardeners linked
to that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the Vegetable Variety
Trial Garden link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is this selective list of
Vegetable Varieties for Gardeners in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to open that one right
there and we get this PDF document.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this document has been produced long
before I arrived, 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a long time it's been coming out
yearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in around 2006, the information we
were getting from commercial researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: who were doing commercial variety trials,
that really declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were trying to identify a
different way to get recommended variety
[SPEAKER_00]: lists for gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to start asking gardeners to
share with us varieties that were working
[SPEAKER_00]: well for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really how we initiated the
Vegetable Varieties for Gardeners Citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: Science Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we created this website with some
additional funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have since not had additional funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been functioning on
essentially no resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little challenging at times,
but it still gets the job done to rate
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that are grown in New York and
come up with options to add to that
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended variety list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go, we're going to come back to
this Vegetable Varieties for Gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let me go to 2017 design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the design for 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I want to go here because I
want to identify a specific variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try Black Seeded Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a variety that you're
going to, we're going to want you to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: us how it did in your particular garden,
trial garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually, I'm not even going to log
into this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just punch in Simpson in the
find box and hit search and see what I
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Black Seeded Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a map of where ratings have
been added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mouse is a little sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can see these are ratings that were
provided in previous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if Patty B from Seneca,
New York is somebody we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that this, I'm pretty sure we
know who that is in St. Lawrence as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see CCE,
[SPEAKER_00]: CCE Onondaga there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Debbie L who's from
Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have CCE Oneida County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Claudia, Claudia from,
that looks like Courtland, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Roger, I think these are a lot of
people we know because we had Black Seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson in our variety trials for many
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want, even if you're already listed
here or if you're not listed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to keep adding to the reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are already listed here and you
know how to get back to this account,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can add to your review of Black Seeded
Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overall cumulative review over
multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't add a review by the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us too much data for us to
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a cumulative review of Black
Seeded Simpson over the life of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to actually look at how you
add a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can certainly add detail about
what happened in any given year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't do year to year a different
review for each year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just give us too much
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go back to, if you do not have
an account, how do you set up an account?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's though not registered with our
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to add a garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you simply fill out this information
and there is a required, you can see which
[SPEAKER_00]: items are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like some of those counties
did, I would choose, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstration garden for your county,
I would choose the demonstration garden
[SPEAKER_00]: for that particular county.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to do, if you have
multiple demonstration gardens and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have multiple garden profiles,
you're welcome to create multiple garden
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you another option if you want
to keep all those profiles linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some limitations to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't gather a lot of
information about the garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make it easy and not too
complicated, not more information than we
[SPEAKER_00]: can really manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me go back to the login.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is my garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here, you can add multiple
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can add an additional garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to have more than one
profile for your county, you can put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, I mean, if you have more than
one garden, you can put it in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: garden profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limitation on that, as I said,
there is one, you would only be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: write one review per variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't quite have that level of
complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I'm actually in there as me,
if we return to Black Seed and Simpson,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you ever run into a problem,
the best thing, because as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: this website was created a while ago,
the best thing to do is just log out and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get in again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that corrects the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just make the best we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: For being a pretty old website,
it functions pretty darn well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we don't have anybody to help
us if we run into a problem where we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit troubled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to Black Seed and Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, you can share your review once
you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, the review is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we have these very simple
questions is because we consulted with
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they ask, they do field trials
with growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the very basic questions that
they ask growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to make it any more
complicated or collect too much data that
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes overwhelming for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much noise when you go into
field trials that collecting very detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the practices people are
using isn't helpful to see how the variety
[SPEAKER_00]: does overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes too specific to be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we focus on these very limited ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just for these below ones,
you just give stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the review, you have a lot of space
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can elaborate on how you're caring for
these, whatever you want to go into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using conventional practices,
organic practices, integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have raised beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you're growing them in containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those details, you can put in your
review as a way to help people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: reading your review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at some of the reviews
in Yelp, oh man, they have novels written
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're free to write a novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can also upload a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to upload one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get this little separate box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you choose a file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I purposely grabbed a file,
grabbed an image that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you get an error, it's usually
that the image is too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to open the photo in some
Photoshop thing and make it small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if you don't get this thing
that says whatever your image is called
[SPEAKER_00]: has been uploaded, then your image is too
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to close that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's my image in there,
which has nothing to do with Black Sea to
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know it was going to fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can always remove my image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to add a photo,
give that a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you upload one and it doesn't work,
and then you keep making it smaller and it
[SPEAKER_00]: still doesn't work, just save and then get
out of the whole program and then go back
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see under manage my reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can always go in and edit my review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if I grow provider bush
beans again this year, I can edit my
[SPEAKER_00]: review of provider bush beans because I've
grown them this year and maybe I'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different overall review of them than I
had when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think part of the problem here is
I'm an administrator, so we're not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what you see when you can edit a
review.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can just click on manage my
reviews, manage my profiles once you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go over to one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These top rated varieties show how many
people have rated those reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most reviewed, not surprising,
we have 101 reviews of SunGold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fabulous if we had hundreds of
reviews of all of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really informs our selected list of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me also go back to this special
variety trial site.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't been there, if you go
there, you'll see that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: while Fiona has uploaded much of the
material for this project there,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things she did not upload was
the signage you can use in the trial
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That signage is available through the
Cornell box folder, which at least one
[SPEAKER_00]: person in each county, typically the
county educator, has access to that
[SPEAKER_00]: account which you can download those signs
and manipulate them locally to suit your
[SPEAKER_00]: needs and print them for yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putnam County has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you want the ratings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how often do we want the ratings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a cumulative rating,
I would say you could go in there any time
[SPEAKER_00]: and put in a rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I think I would go in when I
had something to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here on provider bush bean,
I found out that this bean is not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not terminating well or I'm finding
that seedlings are dying, so I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: having much success rate with seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might go in there and just start the
provider bush bean review because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: always go in there later at Harvest or at
some other juncture and add to the review
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, oh actually, even though they were
slow to get started, in the end they did
[SPEAKER_00]: quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep adding to your review.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the very least, I would hope that you
could go in there at Harvest and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: that review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however it works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might find just taking this review,
you know the things that you have to give
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe you do a paper version that
several people maybe contribute to and
[SPEAKER_00]: then one person goes in and writes the
reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe an intermediate paper version is
helpful and just having one person go in
[SPEAKER_00]: and write the review at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our hope is that once you have
your profile in there from your county,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will continue to add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Nida County, look at them,
they're like super stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, can any of you beat Oneida
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have reviewed 42 varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be fabulous if each county
had 42 varieties, 50 counties had 42
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties in there, you really would be
the ones who are helping us establish that
[SPEAKER_00]: list of recommended varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need your help to do that because our
researchers no longer have interest nor
[SPEAKER_00]: funding to review varieties, how the
performance of varieties, unless they're
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding varieties for a specific purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant breeders might rate the
varieties that they're trying to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question from Patty Batley,
since I already have a username which was
[SPEAKER_00]: used for a demo garden in the past,
should we keep using that or should I
[SPEAKER_00]: create one that says CCE Senator County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, excellent question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to go back to you,
Patty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can go in there and even
change your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my profile, I can actually change my
name from Lori to LJB7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think I can update that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can get in, if you remember
your, the hard part is remembering,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh no, if you can get in there once,
I think you can change your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I've changed my name there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go in and change your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, I'm hoping that the password
recovery works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main part is trying to remember
which email you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you forgot your password, you can go to
recover your password and then it says
[SPEAKER_00]: your email that you use and then it will
send to that account, hopefully still
[SPEAKER_00]: active account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only problem we run into is if
people used an email that they don't no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer use, we can't recover your password
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have access to passwords.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully email address, recover your
account and then change the name to
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you think is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's okay to use the same,
I feel like if you had variety trials in
[SPEAKER_00]: your general vicinity previously,
obviously to use that same account would
[SPEAKER_00]: be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not precisely the exact same
location, but it's pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're not really that fine details
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any trouble trying to get
information in, and just shoot me a note
[SPEAKER_00]: or Fiona and Shabari sent it to me and you
can we'll set you up because this special
[SPEAKER_00]: variety trial garden is really extremely
important that you provide us with this
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in turn, when we go, when a gardener
comes here and it's nice to have more than
[SPEAKER_00]: six ratings about something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and look at this one, this rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody actually successfully uploaded a
picture of this on goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for when pictures are uploaded,
we actually is more than one picture was
[SPEAKER_00]: uploaded, it will show up multiple
pictures will show up across there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see, it would be nice if this
was all just loaded up with reviews from
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states also like to provide reviews,
but we care mostly about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a pretty exciting tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me show you a few other things
about this tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are logged in while we're here and
you're not logged in, you're not asking me
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I could be here for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you a couple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta log back in to do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, once I've logged in and
established account, I can filter my
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews by my state, my frost free zone or
my soil texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do my frost free zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I forgot to tell you about the frost
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the setting up your
profile, and there's a link to like see
[SPEAKER_00]: that frost free map, that link is broken,
we have to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I told you that it's hard to
get things fixed when we don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: programmer but bear with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm seeing the varieties based by
only varieties that are reviewed and in my
[SPEAKER_00]: frost free zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can limit my search that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I typed in something like some
variety or crop, it would limit it even
[SPEAKER_00]: further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can also limit it to my frost
free season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that will get me people outside my
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I just do my state, and this is the
way I go in when I'm updating that variety
[SPEAKER_00]: list, is I limit it to New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I look at what's been rated in
New York state and how many reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I can order it also by not the
highest overall rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it by most reviews and my state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can get this to search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know by my state and the most
number of reviews, oh, look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexi and Simpson, top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we've been having you grow
it for a long time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 21 reviews just for New York
state and really should be twice as many,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe three times, four times as many,
100 reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're encouraging you to follow through
to the end and put in the review of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
