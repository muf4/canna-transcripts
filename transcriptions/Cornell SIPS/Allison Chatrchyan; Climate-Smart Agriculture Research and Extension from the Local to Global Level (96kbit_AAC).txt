[SPEAKER_05]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you so much, Louis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for that very nice
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk to you today about
something a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a social scientist and trained in
environmental political science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this concept of polycentric governance
is really important for addressing climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used it in my work from the local
level to the global level looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have been fortunate to work at
many different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this feeds into my interest in
polycentric governance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I studied at Colby College in Maine and
then went to work on national
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental policy issues in Washington,
DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an environmental consultant,
I then worked at the United Nations
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment Program on the Montreal
Protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finished my PhD at Maryland,
went to work for extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first I worked for Bard College.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I went to work for extension in
the Hudson Valley, working on climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change and environmental issues in that
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a regional level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in between there, I've worked on
issues in Armenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focused my dissertation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came to Cornell, where I've been
here for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved to this department last fall,
or last mid-year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, I was with Art DeGatano in
the Earth and Atmospheric Science
[SPEAKER_00]: Department.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so what I want to talk to you about
today, has anyone heard of polycentric
[SPEAKER_00]: governance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, how cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introducing this to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to talk about this idea,
this concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to introduce climate
smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to focus on my stakeholder
engaged research, the work that I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: with Debbie over the past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be wrapping up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the impacts of climate change
to agriculture in New York state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at my extension work from a
local to national and global level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about climate change,
I just asked my students this on Tuesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many of you would say it is a global
problem, or a national problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a local problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Global?
[SPEAKER_00]: Local?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the above?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a trans-boundary environmental
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that the emissions that we in
every country emit through many sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: including agriculture, once those
greenhouse gases go up in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't stay over the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trans-boundary issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to have a mechanism for
addressing that with many countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: all countries involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this idea of climate governance is the
diplomacy mechanisms and response measures
[SPEAKER_00]: aimed at steering social systems towards
preventing, mitigating, and adapting to
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this idea of polycentric governance
came about in the 40s and 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a system of governance with many
centers of decision-making authority that
[SPEAKER_00]: are needed to cover the full range of
governance tasks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you all said that climate change is a
global and a national and a local issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will it be effective if just the United
Nations and UNFCCC is addressing this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have every national government
addressing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have to have many actors involved
at all levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the political scientist who really
brought this idea to the forefront was
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleanor Ostrom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was trained in political science but
received a Nobel Prize in 2009 for her
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She won the prize in economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she researched how do communities that
manage common pool resources manage them
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And her work really debunked the tragedy
of the commons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she developed these principles of
institutional design, and she really
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on smaller common pool resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, for example, a commons that is a
fishery in Italy or Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do those fishermen work together or
fisherwomen work together to manage that
[SPEAKER_00]: resource?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said that in order to be
effective, you have to have several things
[SPEAKER_00]: in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear group identity, rules that match
local needs, rules that are developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: advised by those that are managing the
resource, sanctions that are known and
[SPEAKER_00]: graduated, and then a responsibility to
link up that management with different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of different interconnected
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's a common pool resource in
Italy, it has to be managed within that
[SPEAKER_00]: small area, but then Italy and then up to
the UN level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ostrom then later in her life thought
about this idea of climate change as a
[SPEAKER_00]: global commons issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she then did some work and published a
really famous report with the World Bank
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing that we can manage, the best way
to manage climate change as a global issue
[SPEAKER_00]: is through polycentric governance.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said that single policies adopted by
one agency like a top-down approach is not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be effective and that leaving
just a United Nations or even thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the United States to solve the
problem will result in free rider issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some countries aren't going to do
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead a polycentric approach is
needed, which has oversight at the local,
[SPEAKER_00]: national, regional level, with many
actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this idea is that you can think
about a ripple going out or interconnected
[SPEAKER_00]: circles, concentric circles of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say many modes and domains of
action, if you think about who is
[SPEAKER_00]: addressing climate change globally,
it's not just national governments or the
[SPEAKER_00]: United Nations, businesses are involved,
NGOs are involved, research institutions
[SPEAKER_00]: like Cornell are involved and we're trying
to work with farmers on the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals to get them involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: She Ostrom said this approach is more
diverse with greater emphasis on a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom-up approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It emphasizes self-organization,
site-specific work, experimentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning and trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a greater number of actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this burgeoning number of
actors involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the opportunity to take Cornell to
the COP 28 meeting in Dubai.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 80,000 people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how many people are working
on climate change, some opposed to it who
[SPEAKER_00]: were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also leads to greater complexity
and innovation, but also the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: coordination and information sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a good metaphor and a
good theory for thinking about the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do here at Cornell when we're
doing research and we're, as I am doing
[SPEAKER_00]: extension work, we are getting individuals
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to focus on site-specific needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have experimentation working
with our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm gonna now turn to how I've used
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to show you that this was an
initiative from the UN climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agency to start to track all of this
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go to their website and look
for their global climate action tracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual countries, cities, companies,
investors, organizations are encouraged to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to tell the UN about their actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have incorporated this into my
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a report that I worked on that
looked at global food security and
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-level governance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the idea that we were gonna
address global food insecurity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these international agreements,
the Paris agreement, we have trade
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements that are setting these goals,
but then they need to be implemented at a
[SPEAKER_00]: national level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they need to be implemented on a
local level with farmers or agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: producers have to be able to make change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just an example of some of the
work that I've done with interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues here at Cornell that have used
these ideas and looked at non-state
[SPEAKER_00]: actors, looked at sub-national
governments, looked at how politicians are
[SPEAKER_00]: tweeting about climate change,
not a government agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll turn now to a little bit more
about my stakeholder engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stakeholder is a term that's thrown out
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Decker taught at Cornell for many
years in natural resources department.
[SPEAKER_00]: He defined it as a stakeholder as any
citizen or group potentially affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: or with a vested interest in an issue,
a program, an action, or a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know through research from many
social scientists that if we are designing
[SPEAKER_00]: an extension program or we're developing
decision tools, they're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective unless we know what stakeholders
understand, what they need, how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna use the tools or the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is summarized well by this quote
by Bartels who says, any process to engage
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders around the issue of climate
change that fails to systematically
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and incorporate their views
their values, beliefs, and identities is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to not be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first came to Cornell 10 years
ago and worked with many colleagues,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Art DeGatano and others here,
we thought about the fact that we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand what stakeholders knew about
climate change, what farmers understood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then develop our decision support
tools and our extension programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not just a one way process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want input, a two way process
from those that are gonna use our
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll explain how I've used this with
this concept of climate smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have heard of the term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say this term was developed by
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10, 12 years ago, it's come to much
greater prominence now, both globally,
[SPEAKER_00]: many countries that have developed their
nationally determined contributions to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Paris Agreement have included climate
smart agriculture for mitigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the United States, two years ago,
Biden administration announced they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have a climate smart commodities program
to funnel billions of dollars through
[SPEAKER_00]: grants, including one at Cornell with New
York State to farmers to adopt climate
[SPEAKER_00]: smart agriculture practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you've heard of the term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a three pronged approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It focuses on mitigation, sustainably
increasing food productivity and income,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then strengthening resilience or
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adaptation, mitigation, and increasing
food production sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the work that I've done at Cornell over
the past 10 years has used that framework
[SPEAKER_00]: as a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came in 2017, I worked on a
meta analysis looking at US agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholder views and decisions on climate
change that was published in Wires Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with a postdoc, David Lane,
and others, including colleagues from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast Climate Hub, we did conducted
focus groups with farmers in Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State, and Wisconsin to
understand what are they experiencing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are their views on climate change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what actions are they taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, we found that farmers are
experienced extreme weather events,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're more likely to take action on
their farms, either to mitigate or adapt
[SPEAKER_00]: if they've experienced climate change
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're more likely to be willing to
adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many farmers are still very skeptical of
the human causation of climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a need to keep understanding
these views if they're changing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the climate smart farming program
at Cornell, we also conducted local
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews and captured videos of farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this quote from Tor Aschner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've met him, he farms about 1,000
acres of organic grain in Newfield,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we interviewed him a few years
ago now, he said, a normal season does not
[SPEAKER_00]: seem like it happens anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either really dry or really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like when we get rain,
it's apocalyptic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got five inches of rain in about an
hour and a half, and I had a lot of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the impact for generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, when we talked with him
about, there's a wonderful map from the
[SPEAKER_00]: National Climate Assessment that shows
that the Northeast region has seen a 55%
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in extreme rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are getting rain, it's coming
in these heavy downpours.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't aware that this was connected to
climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew it was happening on his farm,
and he felt the impact of soil loss and
[SPEAKER_00]: erosion, but he didn't connect it to
global climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important to be talking to
farmers and helping them make these
[SPEAKER_00]: connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with funding from Multistate Hatch
Project, I conducted a survey of New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State farmers with colleagues,
including Shorna Allred, who was at
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell and now is at UNC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we conducted a random sample of New
York State farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make the point that doing a
survey is very challenging to do it well
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be able to publish the work,
it has to be very rigorous and connected
[SPEAKER_00]: to the theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have a research question
that you want to understand, develop the
[SPEAKER_00]: survey questions to try to ascertain data
that will answer that research question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can't just use a survey
sample from like sending it out with
[SPEAKER_00]: extension to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but that's not a rigorous survey
that is random sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So USDA is also very particular about
farmer data, and they will not provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: with contact names for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have this concept of survey
fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be really careful that we're
not over surveying the farmers that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had to purchase a sample
through a magazine that actually goes to
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they gave us very accurate and updated
farmers, including their address,
[SPEAKER_00]: phone, and email.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then developed, we didn't have funding
to do a mailed survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used the Cornell Qualtrics tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an online survey that was sent out
to 3,400 farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a response completion of 524
surveys, which is a response rate of 15%,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really high for survey work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we did a non-response survey with 26
completions to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: responses we were getting were not biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found through our non-response
survey that they were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, we asked questions
about how farmers viewed climate change,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actions they were taking to mitigate
and adapt to climate change, whether they
[SPEAKER_00]: were taking those actions because of
climate change or just because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: adopting no-till, because it's a good
practice to adopt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we asked them several questions
about decision tools and precision
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that 83% of the farmers
surveyed have experienced extreme weather
[SPEAKER_00]: events that affected their farm in the
past five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 57% of farmers felt they did not have
the financial capacity or the capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: address climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a real need for providing
support and funding to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also found that 68% of the farmers that
responded were concerned or very concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: about drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: 64% were concerned or very concerned about
extreme precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: For adaptation practices, you can see what
they were utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For decision tools, interestingly,
63% of those we asked were not using any
[SPEAKER_00]: apps or smartphones or mobile devices to
inform their management decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a few years ago now, but I think
this is probably the large farmers in New
[SPEAKER_00]: York state are probably using precision
agriculture and they're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller and medium-sized farmers,
they may be using weather apps,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not using more in-depth
decision tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: The barriers we found were the top three
responses were, I'm not aware of these
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, they're too costly, or they don't
apply to my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another bit of information we asked
about specific resources they were using,
[SPEAKER_00]: some were using the US drought monitor,
the farmer's almanac, and the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: channel was the biggest tool they were
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the farmers who were not using
tools who were interested, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in the climate smart farming
tools and the Northeast Regional Climate
[SPEAKER_00]: Center data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna do a small shout out to Louis
through Philip, I've made a connection in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hallway being upstairs on the 10th
floor, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realized that we have this data from
this statewide survey that we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: published yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Louis has conducted interviews with
farms and started to analyze them and has
[SPEAKER_00]: funding to do a survey in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do what's called a mixed method
analysis, combine these data sets and have
[SPEAKER_00]: a richer analysis and understanding of how
farmers are thinking about farm
[SPEAKER_00]: digitization and experimentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I wanna quickly talk about the New
York State Climate Impacts Assessment
[SPEAKER_00]: Project that I've worked on with Debbie
Aller and several other faculty at Cornell
[SPEAKER_00]: and other organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a hugely in-depth project,
we're super excited it's coming to an end
[SPEAKER_00]: soon, it should be published very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have worked with climate change in
New York State, you know that the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment was the climate report and I
use that all the time in my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an analogous to the National Climate
Assessment, but for New York State or the
[SPEAKER_00]: IPCC assessments that are done for a
global level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the task of our chapter was to
look at how climate impacts the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture sector since the last report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used a really rigorous methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were our participants, we had a very
strong advisory committee that read the
[SPEAKER_00]: drafts and participated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate change data was updated by
Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here, these are the
projected annual average temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York State during the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historical observations since 1901,
average temperatures in New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: have increased by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the projections for the future really
depend on the emissions that we and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone around the globe emits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a range there, but temperatures
could rise between five, an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: five to 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the 20 eighties, which would really be
catastrophic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to address, try to bring those
emissions down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the data for precipitation,
total annual precipitation in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: State has increased from 1901 to 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fastest increase has occurred
since the early 1980s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will in with projections,
we will see an increase of between nine to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12% by the 20 eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a blessing and a curse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about the Southwestern United
States, my colleague Toby Alt in earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: atmospheric science has studied mega
droughts and where agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it is produced in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those areas are going to be much,
much more dry in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going to have water in New York
State, but the way that we receive that
[SPEAKER_00]: water is very challenging for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in these heavy rainfall events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also know that the plant hardiness
zones for New York State and the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: country have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing warmer winters and longer
growing seasons and changes in plant
[SPEAKER_00]: hardiness zones that have shifted across
the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested, you can look up the
plant hardiness zone maps from USDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the key findings are that there's five
key findings from this impacts assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key findings, I won't go into detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll send it around to the
department when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most severe impacts are extreme
precipitation, short-term drought,
[SPEAKER_00]: heat stress, warmer winters, late spring
freeze, increased press pressure and
[SPEAKER_00]: production costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second finding is that climate change
is a threat multiplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a lot of work interviewing farmers,
talking to our advisory committee and
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change may not be the number one
challenge they're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be facing labor shortages or
production costs rising, but climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change makes all these other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exacerbates these stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third key finding is that we see that
farmers and ag stakeholders show awareness
[SPEAKER_00]: and acknowledgement of climate change
impacts on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a big, I think,
shift that I've seen in the last 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of my work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key finding four, farmers are implementing
and investing in practices, but they need
[SPEAKER_00]: support and funding and information to
make those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fifth key finding is that
enhancing technical support, financial
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance and research is critical for
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also conducted really interesting case
studies and you can see this wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: quote from a local dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to invest in the farm when
there's so much uncertainty about whether
[SPEAKER_00]: dairy prices will break even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw many small farms across the hills
and now there are only three farms left in
[SPEAKER_00]: this valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the last couple of minutes,
I'll turn to my work on extension outreach
[SPEAKER_00]: and education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this before and for this
group, so I won't spend time, but we
[SPEAKER_00]: developed a climate smart farming website
and tools that you can play around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're free for any farmer from the
Northeast, in the Northeast from Maine to
[SPEAKER_00]: West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers can enter specific data about
their farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are based on this concept of
climate smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some of the tools that we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growing degree day calculator is shown
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the growing degree day base
that is built for right now for corn,
[SPEAKER_00]: showing corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will show a farmer in the season
where they are with their crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can look at crop capturing growing
degree day accumulation units,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they can look at past seasons and see
how that has changed and make really
[SPEAKER_00]: management decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our extension team, including
Candice Hulbert, who's just joined
[SPEAKER_00]: Johannes and I and Art Degutano and
Debbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to do more, but I've done
work going out to farms with our extension
[SPEAKER_00]: team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently we were at the ag society
forum in Syracuse with our display and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting youth to answer a survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was in Albany on Monday,
a lot of interest in climate smart
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another program that I'm running
this spring with the USDA climate hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a dairy climate adaptation
fellowship program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are training pairs of dairy farmers
with an advisor and it's a nine week
[SPEAKER_00]: training program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to do field events
and they're going to develop an adaptation
[SPEAKER_00]: and mitigation plan for their farm this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another program that I've developed here
at Cornell is the Cornell climate stewards
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's modeled after the master gardener
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had farmers take the training and do
a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not only just getting trained
on climate science and impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they agree to do a project in their
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far we've trained 94 climate stewards
from 15 counties, including those
[SPEAKER_00]: extension educators from out in the
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I'm now working with Johannes
and Candice on this AI climate Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can share more information about
it over the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that AI and machine learning
and large amounts of data can improve
[SPEAKER_00]: decision tools and understanding and
decision making of policymakers and
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to be able to better address and
solve climate change by improving
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation and adaptation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Candice and I and Johannes,
we are working on the stakeholder
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be conducting focus groups and
surveys with farmers and policymakers
[SPEAKER_00]: about AI and climate smart agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already out doing training as we get
more information and we're planning to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, a four H career explode
activity this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the final thing I'll say is that
I've worked on this issue from a local to
[SPEAKER_00]: the global level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been very fortunate to lead Cornell's
delegation to the cop since cop 21 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a badge every for the past five years
from the government of Armenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can go in the ag agriculture
negotiations, really see how the countries
[SPEAKER_00]: are working on this issue, what they care
about and help with the negotiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was in Dubai.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had several students and faculty go
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of an event on climate smart
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw John Kerry walk by and said,
Hey, we're from Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the agriculture negotiations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe it's really important to be
at this global level with our climate
[SPEAKER_00]: smart agriculture research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are key takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stakeholder engagement is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extension education is critical training
and outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get farmers to adopt practices
without training them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And policy engagement is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would end by saying climate change
affects everything and begins with each of
[SPEAKER_00]: us and what we can do in our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my son, Robert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's now a freshman at Cornell and he's
studying viticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have him in your classes and
get involved just like ripples spread out
[SPEAKER_00]: when dropped in the water, the actions of
individuals can have far reaching effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Judy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question for the focus
group research we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a focus group as a group interview
and you want to have like minded people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have about a max of 10 farmers
in a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did have separate commodity groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a focus group with vegetable
growers, dairy, fruit and vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that data was what we got was based on
different commodity groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survey that I did of New York state
farmers, we asked them what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and what their commodity was,
but we didn't differentiate the practices
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that could be something that we think
of in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survey that I did in New York state,
we didn't ask them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an online survey and we had to be
really careful about limiting the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be certainly something we think
about for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully with Louie doing a survey,
maybe a smaller scale in New York state or
[SPEAKER_00]: with Candice, we could think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a question for Judy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like you have sort of
partitioned out user groups with the tools
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you actually done that at this point
where you can sort of say these are the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that they're doing and then can
that be linked to effects and implications
[SPEAKER_03]: of that kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but interestingly, I took that slide
out, but Debbie and I worked hard in the
[SPEAKER_00]: New York state climate impacts assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NYSERDA really wanted in this impacts
assessment to have a focus on adaptation,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only understanding the impacts,
but what are the adaptations that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our team, we came up with a table
that is differentiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that the climate impacts to
dairy or vegetable growers are different
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're also different based on the
region where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the table has suggested adaptations for
dairy, for field crops, for fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: for aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that we could follow
up with and see by sector, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers really adopting these practices
because of climate impacts or are they
[SPEAKER_00]: just adopting them because they're good
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with folks like Matt Ryan or
others, doing long-term studies to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the effectiveness on agriculture systems
would be really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: My immediate response to that is that
since I'd be more on the Louie end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum, we're saying rather than say
this is your research, these guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing research on their farms,
intentionally or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the people that should be
teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't be telling what you should
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should basically use these as
demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're doing with the
dairy climate adaptation fellowship.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four of those programs running
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are running the dairy one, but we're
partnering with it's a peer training
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're partnering a farmer with a
consultant and then they're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out and actually do develop an
implementation plan for their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to share what they're doing
with us and with other farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems that you've got a natural
experiment going on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we could take advantage of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said I would only ask an easy question.
[SPEAKER_06]: An easy question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, how does this information get
back to the legislature?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a structural relation in which
all this information of the assessment is
[SPEAKER_06]: presented to the legislature?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the New York State climate assessment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that definitely will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was driven by New York State NYSERDA
agency with it was we were appointed by
[SPEAKER_00]: Governor Hokel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a similar mitigation work and
we were the impacts and adaptation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's going to be a stronger
effort to get the information out and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's used.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking that certain regulations
that might be in law might need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: changed according to changing
circumstances.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you found is the planning for
rights for the farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you only plan for three or four
years, you might react very differently to
[SPEAKER_02]: the recommendations that have been planned
for 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Debbie did some interviews with
grape growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Deb, do you want to chime in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that perennial crops, those
farmers are much more aware of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it certainly varies by commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big part of it is how much does an
individual farmer experience the impacts
[SPEAKER_04]: of climate change?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big part is the financial side of
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability of a farmer to actually have
the financial capacity to implement
[SPEAKER_04]: adaptation practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So certain practices that can be adopted
by perennial fruit growers and the costs
[SPEAKER_04]: around those, for example, like wind
machines, which are more than like $30,000
[SPEAKER_04]: for a single wind machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge upfront investment by the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ability for them to adopt practices
like that, they need to have a long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: vision for their farm as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a really good question in terms of
the planning process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it varies farm by farm and cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Harold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering, and I really
appreciate your presentation, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: report that there are some negative trends
in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the dairy industry has really
gone to coincided production over
[SPEAKER_01]: perennial forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so corn sod is much less resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates a lot more runoff potential and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the report address some of those
issues as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: That basically nutritionists are promoting
coincided production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is more efficient in terms of milk
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not very good for climate
adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a negative climate adaptation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that being addressed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are some of the tough
questions that people don't want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did try really hard to look at issues
like that, the complex issues between
[SPEAKER_00]: economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a whole section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if we actually had a
section on that specific issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will keep it in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
