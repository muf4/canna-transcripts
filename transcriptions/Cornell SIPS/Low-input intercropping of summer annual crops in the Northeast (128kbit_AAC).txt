[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really lovely introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start out with some thank yous
of my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to my committee,
Laurie Drinkwater and Harold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have been wise and pragmatic and
encouraging and supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really helped me shape my
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a huge thank you to my lab,
the Sustainable Cropping Systems Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, I couldn't have done it without
you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so grateful and appreciative that
we work so well together as a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much fun to go to work every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thank you to Jerry Cherney,
who helped with forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steven Mersky, my USDA collaborator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul and Mike out at the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Wilson from King's AgroSeed,
who helped select seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you to Sonam and to the grad
students within the department and other
[SPEAKER_00]: plant science departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a really straightforward
background, an outline of how the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation will go, some background
information, some methods, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: results section, which I'll be presenting
in two parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is crop performance, so a little bit
about crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is more applied,
so some of the benefits and trade-offs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the different seed treatments I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll do a summary, and then I'll
tell you about some future plans I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt didn't say this, but I will be doing
a PhD with Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't imagine leaving the lab this
winter or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to start off with, this is a graph
that describes the trend in dairy farms
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the number of farms over time is
declining, and the average farm size is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, this trend is very disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just for dairy farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true in other ag systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But particularly within dairy farms,
there's been this huge decline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms with less than 200 cows have,
the farm size has decreased between 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: and 2006 by 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really huge, and this trend is
predicted to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of structural differences
that come with farm sizes, and probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest takeaway of that for this
presentation is that smaller farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller dairy farms, tend to grow more at
their own feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a map that describes forage
projection in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those who aren't familiar,
forage is the edible plant part that isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grain is not separated, and the
forages are then fed to a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: grazing animals, so cows, sheep,
goats, but in this case, mostly cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is a huge producer of forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third largest producer of corn silage,
alfalfa and timothy, also up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those forages go into dairy
production, and New York is the third
[SPEAKER_00]: largest producer of milk in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the 2012 drought in
Austin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In August, I started grad school at this
time, so I started when this drought was
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and when I was actually studying
agriculture for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was very influential for what my
research eventually came to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was also, it was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happened in the States, and 80% of
agricultural land was affected,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75% of corn and soybean production were
severely or greater affected by the
[SPEAKER_00]: drought, mostly in the heartland here,
but also you can see that New York State
[SPEAKER_00]: up here has some different colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was affected by the drought,
and it was this that kind of took my
[SPEAKER_00]: research in a way, on a certain path,
and it was very emotional for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we would drive past and we would
see the corn that was just very stunted,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we would see farmers standing in their
fields just looking lost and desolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea what they could do,
and so one of the options farmers have is
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could plant these summer annual
forage intercrops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically right now, they're mostly
known as these emergency forages,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're planted after corn failure,
but they also fit into the small grain
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sometimes known as triple
cropping, and that's when you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: winter cereal and it's coming out,
so like after triticale or after wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you plant these things in the
middle of the summer, and then the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season is short enough that you can get
them out in time to really establish
[SPEAKER_00]: another cereal crop, another grain crop
into the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can plant these between the middle
of June and the middle of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty fast growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a forage cut between 35,
45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds reach maturity around mid-July.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days, and the species I've selected for
this presentation for the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are drought tolerant and in general
require fewer inputs than corn silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some very basic benefits for
intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you're decreasing the risk by
planting multiple species, so by having
[SPEAKER_00]: different species that react differently,
that use the resources differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spreading out that risk and you're
really tapping into the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This in turn increases the resilience of
the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It strengthens it because you really are
depending on the species that are there
[SPEAKER_00]: and the things that come with it by
changing the pester or weed pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the microbial communities of the
soil, and instead of relying on these
[SPEAKER_00]: external inputs, which I think is quite a
fragile system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is also, Pearson calls this
the regenerative semi-closed agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's when the nutrients are kind of
coming off of the farm and then if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a dairy production, that manure is
staying on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about it in terms of where
the nutrients are going, it's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: closed structure than if you're exporting
nutrients to and from.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, so some related summer annual
intercrops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a growing interest among
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly the NRCS has been promoting
the summer annual intercrops as cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: cocktails and mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Ray Archuleta from the NRCS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should make a motivational
poster of this for the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this NRCS guy directing us to plant
summer annual intercrops?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been research done by Kevin
Armstrong in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were comparing grass-legging mixtures
for forage quality for with corn silage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they tested out some different
legumes, and they said that the lab labine
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the forage quality because
you're increasing the crude protein,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not decreasing the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty key for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to take a yield cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan Brainerd also did some research with
Robin Belinder regarding grass-legging
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They chose two grasses and two legumes,
and the best combination they found was
[SPEAKER_00]: cowpea with millet, which improved
nodulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowered the seed cost because the
grains are less expensive than the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they managed to reduce the weed
seed production than if they were planting
[SPEAKER_00]: the cowpea separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some considerations with intercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find intercropping experiments,
they're very challenging because they get
[SPEAKER_00]: so big so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're like, what species should I
look at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I should look at, also I should
look at the seeding rate, and all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden you have like 500 different
treatments, and then your committee says,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably shouldn't have 500 different
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species selection is very important,
and even within species, different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar selection is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeding rates you choose, and then the
ratio of those seeding rates to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: species, as well as the soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on your playing field,
where you're starting off with really,
[SPEAKER_00]: what am I trying to say, it really affects
the crop production later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have very fertile soil,
then perhaps the grasses would do better,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have more legumes and less
fertile soil, then the legumes would do
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to summarize my entire two and a
half years here in one slide, I'm testing
[SPEAKER_00]: the ecological theory and quantifying
potential benefits from intercropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm doing this within an alternative
warm season drought tolerant functionally
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse cropping mixture in the northeast
and in the mid-Atlantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also, so these two points,
these are like a little more theoretical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm very much interested in how does
this knowledge apply to farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can people use this information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really want to quantify the
trade-offs between forage quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, and determine optimal management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really would like to tell farmers at the
end, I've tested this, and I think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the best mixture, or the best thing you
can do in your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two main research questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is how do crops reform,
and are there even benefits to
[SPEAKER_00]: intercropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second research question is,
what are the trade-offs between yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: forage quality over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: For species selection, I chose four
species, and I based it off of two
[SPEAKER_00]: different functional traits, so nitrogen
fixing ability, whether a plant is a grass
[SPEAKER_00]: or a legume, and also plant architecture,
so the stature of the plant, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: bushy or taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the two grasses, I chose a
hybrid pearl millet, and it's abbreviated
[SPEAKER_00]: with an M, and it's throughout their
presentation, and it's the shorter variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of millet used for forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the tall grass, I used
sorghum sudan grass, the BMR variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a cross between sorghum and
sorghum sudanese grass, and it looks very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows quite tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the two legumes, I used cow peas,
and in the South, we call them black-eyed
[SPEAKER_00]: peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're abbreviated with a C, and then
sunhemp, and sunhemp is abbreviated with
[SPEAKER_00]: an H, and sunhemp, I think, is the least
familiar of these crops to this audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's native to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this fiber and forage crop that they
grow there, and it's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows quite tall, and it's very
beautiful, and the leaves and the stem are
[SPEAKER_00]: iridescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had two growing seasons, 2013 and
2014, and three different field sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were at Beltsville, Maryland,
the USDA headquarters, and then Aurora,
[SPEAKER_00]: New York, which is about 40 miles away
from here, and then our most northern site
[SPEAKER_00]: was in Willisboro, New York, and so that
was in the middle of that Adirondacks next
[SPEAKER_00]: to Vermont, and we had a different number
of fields, so if there was times two,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we had two fields at that field site.
[SPEAKER_00]: We planted between the middle of June to
the middle of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four to six reps per site.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the experiment design, we prepped the
seed beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Chris on our tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we prepped the seed beds, plowed this
cultivact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We applied 35 kilograms per hectare of
nitrogen in the form of poultry litter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 35 kilograms is half the recommended
amount as sorghum, seed, and grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the idea for doing it like that is
that if we fertilize at the full
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation, then we're really shifting
that fertility, that competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: over to the grasses, which are able to use
that nitrogen more efficiently than the
[SPEAKER_00]: legumes, and then if we didn't fertilize
at all, we're afraid we would shift the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition too much to the legumes,
and so we split the difference and decided
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 was a good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pesticides or herbicides were applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's pretty typical for the
forage system, but this is low input,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I would like to emphasize that,
and seeds were drilled to four centimeters
[SPEAKER_00]: down, and plot sizes range from nine to 40
meters squared.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a single cut, so in some forages,
you can take multiple cuts over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you take cuts of the regrowth,
but because we're using a mixture of
[SPEAKER_00]: species, they have different maturity
dates, different regrowth rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just did a single cut system,
and that was also a way to keep the number
[SPEAKER_00]: of samplings down into the pragmatic
sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: For seed treatments, we have the four
species in monoculture, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeding rates here in this middle
column, and again the abbreviations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the cost per hectare of those
seeds, and then we tested four
[SPEAKER_00]: three-species mixtures, and they're
indicated with an X, and then we have
[SPEAKER_00]: their cost per hectare, and of course the
one possible four-species mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeding rates were, for the
three-species mixture, each species was
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded at one-third of its rate in
monoculture, so if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: millet in a three-species mixture,
21 divided by three, you're seeding at
[SPEAKER_00]: seven kilograms per hectare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the four-species rate,
you're seeding at one-quarter of its
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture rate, and it was a randomized
complete block design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different sampling methods, so we took
crop density, crop biomass, and weed
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We essentially weighed a half-meter square
quadrat down, and we clipped at 10
[SPEAKER_00]: centimeters above the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was to simulate a forage cut where
they're not going to be clipping right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil level, but a little bit above,
and then crops were separated out by
[SPEAKER_00]: species, and then dried, and then later
weighed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had two sampling dates in 2013,
45 days and 90 days after planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in 2014, we added an additional
sampling date at 35 days, and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of that was to really get to the
forage quality question, how does forage
[SPEAKER_00]: quality change over 35 and 45 days,
which is kind of the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the biomass sampling,
we also took light transmittance to assess
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that by sliding a line sensor
underneath the canopy, and then holding a
[SPEAKER_00]: point sensor above the canopy,
and then taking simultaneous measurements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was to capture how much light was
passing through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we did take some soil samples to
understand the baseline fertility of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that we were working in.
[SPEAKER_00]: For data analysis for this presentation,
I'll be talking to you about the 45 days
[SPEAKER_00]: pooled across sites and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't major site differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the orders of the treatment were
pretty similar across all the sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were really big year differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you all noticed,
but 2014 was quite a bit colder than 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: for the summer, so the biomass production
in 2014 was almost half of that in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: To analyze the data, I did an analysis of
variance with treatment as the fixed
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, and year, block, and location were
considered random effects, and then I used
[SPEAKER_00]: a two-key test to show the differences
between the means.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the results section, part one,
the crop performance part.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a couple of shots of us in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is last year at Aurora, about a month
after planting, and the letters here
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate the seeding treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the cow pee and monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy really hadn't closed,
especially if you look at the four-species
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two months later, you see here the millet
and the sunhemp were planted in
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking very full and nice,
but when you look at the species mixtures,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just have so much texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look like they're taking up so
much more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is data for the 45 days after
planting pools across sites and years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the total biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down at the bottom, we have the
four-species and monoculture, the four
[SPEAKER_00]: three-species mixtures, and then the one
four-species mixture, and then the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass in kilograms per hectare on the
y-axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the legumes in monoculture did
not really do that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grasses were very similar and very
similar to the mixtures with millet,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum, sunhemp producing the highest
amount of biomass, and then the sorghum,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunhemp, cow pee producing the lowest
amount of biomass in the mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a graph, the same one you saw
before, except now you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of the mixtures, and so each
color stands for a monoculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then here you can see a lot of purple
and green, and those are the grasses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they make up quite a bit of that crop
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominant weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some issues with volunteer crops,
depending on our field sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: At one site in Willisboro, we went in
after a canola variety trial, and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a lot of canola, but it was very
terrible because we considered it weed
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, though, that stuff makes great
forage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike kept trying to convince me,
oh, you should run the forage quality
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis with the weed biomass,
and I was like, yes, I would love to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because we know this would be so
much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also had some issues with some
volunteer wheat, so at Aurora,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a later planting date, and I think
Paul was driving his tractor, driving the
[SPEAKER_00]: combine off the field as Chris was driving
the tractor onto the field to prepare the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seedbeds, so any wheat that didn't
make it onto the combine had a very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: weed seedbed to grow into, but again,
it would probably make for some decent
[SPEAKER_00]: forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another field, we had an issue with
mustard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit more about that in
a second, and then pretty much the usual
[SPEAKER_00]: suspects of summer annual weeds,
ragweed, pigweed, lamb's quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, we have a weed phytometer,
and this mustard in bloom was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was beautiful, and it was great
also for seeing the treatment differences,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can just look here, and I've
divided the field by the different
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the mixture that contained the
sorghum was very good at out-computing the
[SPEAKER_00]: mustard, but this very dark yellow,
lots of yellow down in this corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a cowpea monoculture,
so really, you could just tell the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference of how competitive some species
and some mixtures were.
[SPEAKER_00]: This graph shows a crop biomass in the
brown, and the weed biomass in the yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: bars on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see that the legume
monocultures produce the most weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses were not very weedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the mixtures didn't have that many
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all a little similar,
though, and as terrible as the cowpea and
[SPEAKER_00]: sunhemp were at suppressing weeds,
they certainly did a good job more than
[SPEAKER_00]: they could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2014, we had a control plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put control plots in all of our fields,
and you can really tell how much less
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when just something was planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the crop production and
the crop biomass and the weed biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: also doing some additional metrics,
land equivalent ratio, which measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of mixtures relative to
monocultures, the crop growth rate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which just shows the change in biomass
over the change in time, and also species
[SPEAKER_00]: evenness by biomass, which shows the
relative production and measures the
[SPEAKER_00]: relative production and species dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all three kind of snapshots
of how these mixtures performed and how
[SPEAKER_00]: the species within the mixtures performed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, land equivalent ratio,
it is the sum of the ratios of inner crop
[SPEAKER_00]: yield for a species divided by the
monoculture yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to depict it in this cartoon
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the inner crop, you can see that all
the species grow better than when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: planted separately in monoculture,
and this is due to less intra-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LERs that are greater than one describe
when inner crops are more efficient than
[SPEAKER_00]: monocultures, and very excitingly,
all the mixtures that were planted for
[SPEAKER_00]: this experiment had LERs that were greater
than one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these mixtures were more
efficient in terms of biomass production
[SPEAKER_00]: per space than if the species had been
separated out and planted in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crop growth rate measured in
kilograms per hectare per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we have two columns for the
grasses and two columns for the legumes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I showed the slope of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the crop growth rates for the
grasses in monoculture are really high,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it shows a much steeper slope than the
legumes, which have a lower crop growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate, and they have a smaller slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to walk you through this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millet's growth rate, when it was in
monoculture, it was about 17 kilograms per
[SPEAKER_00]: hectare per day, and then when it was
planted in these mixtures, it decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this mixture, it didn't decrease
significantly, so the growth rate when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was planted with the sunhemp and the
cowpea was similar to that, as if it were
[SPEAKER_00]: planted in monoculture, and the other
growth rates decreased a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar trend you see with sorghum,
it has a very high crop growth rate when
[SPEAKER_00]: it was in monoculture, and it falls when
it is planted in mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, you're also seeding at like
one third to a quarter of the monoculture
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legumes are a little bit of a sadder
story, so their crop growth rate in
[SPEAKER_00]: monoculture were lower just in general
than the grasses, so these plants'
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics just have a slower growth
rate, and when they were planted with
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures, it just got lumped a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cowpea fell by a decrease, the crop growth
rate decreased by an order of magnitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it was really facing a lot of
competition when it was intercropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the third snapshot, the third
additional metric I want to describe to
[SPEAKER_00]: you is species evenness, and usually
species evenness is done with plant
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that doing it by biomass was a
little bit more revealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we see low evenness in this cartoon,
and you can see that the sun, the one
[SPEAKER_00]: species is much bigger than the other
species, and then a high evenness means
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants grow similarly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So species evenness is a metric that goes
from zero to one, and the blue bars here
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate evenness at 45 days, and the
brown bars are evenness at 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see that millet, sorghum,
sunhemp, it was the most even species at
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 days, and also the most even at 90
days, and that just says those three
[SPEAKER_00]: species, when they're planted together,
if you think of them as a team,
[SPEAKER_00]: each teammate is holding its own weight a
little bit more than if you had sorghum,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunhemp, and cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just imagine that cowpea was
dominating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its growth definitely was much greater
than the sunhemp and the cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general, species evenness
decreased over time, so as the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season went on, there was a decrease,
as one species became more dominant than
[SPEAKER_00]: other species in some of these mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to summarize this part of the results
section, mixtures produced a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of biomass as grass monocultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was over-yielding seen by all the
mixtures indicated by an LER greater than
[SPEAKER_00]: one, and there was a higher crop growth
rate in general in the monocultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for millet with sunhemp and cowpea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixtures with two grasses tended to be
more even, and mixtures with two legumes
[SPEAKER_00]: tended to be less even, and there was a
decrease in evenness over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to switch to the more applied
findings, the second results section.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes back to the question,
what are the trade-offs between yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: forage quality over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very short primer on forage
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forage quality tends to decrease over
time, as the plants get larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: while the yield tends to increase,
and so that reason mostly is because when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are younger, they have a lower
fiber content, and that fiber content
[SPEAKER_00]: means the animal can consume more of that
diet, and also it's higher energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the cell contents are full of
these nutritious, quickly digestible
[SPEAKER_00]: things, sugars, proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant ages, there's an increase in
these structural carbohydrates that make
[SPEAKER_00]: up the cell wall, particularly
hemicellulose and cellulose, and so when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a high-fiber diet, when the plant is
older, then there's a lower intake by the
[SPEAKER_00]: animals, because they feel fuller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more fiber when they're eating
that, and because they cannot consume as
[SPEAKER_00]: much, there is a lower energy just in
general of the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is relative feed value at 35 days
in 2014, and relative feed value is this
[SPEAKER_00]: metric between digestibility and fiber
content, and it was used by the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: for a very long time before it became
affordable to test for the protein
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not able to get the protein analysis
done in time for this presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm using this metric, even though it
only tells part of the story, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't require any protein content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative feed value is this metric that's
based off of forage legumes, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you, gives you this one number of
how good or not a forage is, and so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the relative feed value is quite high
for the legumes, and this metric tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: over, to underestimate forage quality for
grasses, so that's the reason it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: used as much anymore, and so the grasses
in monoculture are quite low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have these mixtures, the millet
sorghum, or sorry, the millet sunhemp
[SPEAKER_00]: cowpea, has the highest forage quality of
all the mixtures, and the other mixtures
[SPEAKER_00]: perform similarly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: These yellow bars here indicate what kind
of feed you would like to give to a cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brighter yellow is what you would,
the kind of quality of feed you would give
[SPEAKER_00]: to a lactating cow, and the less yellow,
the browner bar, is feed that's still good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, but maybe not as much energy that
you would give to a cow that is producing
[SPEAKER_00]: milk, so you can see that mostly,
except for the sorghum, just by a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, all fit into this range that it's
safe to feed, and even good to feed for
[SPEAKER_00]: lactating cows, and again, this metric
really underestimates the forage quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next part, this next graph,
really tries to answer the question of
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the trade-offs between yield and
the forage quality, and so the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this metric was just to multiply the
relative feed value by the yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we know that the grasses had a very
high yield compared to the legumes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also know that the grasses didn't
have that great of a forage quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here we see these big differences,
so the purple bars are the first harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: at 35 days, and then the green are 45
days, and the blue are 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see some really nice high bars for
these legumes when they're in monoculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that falls, and part of its falling is
due to a decrease in forage quality over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but part of it is also to the fact
that they don't yield quite as much as the
[SPEAKER_00]: millet or the sorghum, so you have yield
that's really pushing up these bars here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to overwhelm you all with
all the bars all at once, but here are the
[SPEAKER_00]: different mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that the millet, sun hemp,
calvi have the highest forage quality for
[SPEAKER_00]: the mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls, and then yield really takes over
for some of the, yield is making up the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the bar sizes for some of
these other mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just in general, I want to summarize
that there were a lot of slight year
[SPEAKER_00]: differences for forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forage quality decreased over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autumn will harvest for the grasses and
the mixtures using the relative feed value
[SPEAKER_00]: metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that 35 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legumes contained less fiber and were more
digestible, and grasses in monoculture had
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher fiber content, and because most
of the mixtures, the majority of that
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture, the biomass of that mixture was
grasses, the mixtures also had quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: high fiber content as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I would like to touch on the
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to develop some of
these ideas more, but here we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost per hectare that we saw at the
beginning for the seeds, for the different
[SPEAKER_00]: seed treatments, we have 35 days,
45 days, and 90 days production per
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar, so that's kilograms per dollar,
and you can see really that millet has
[SPEAKER_00]: this very low seeding cost per hectare,
and this is for a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, but related reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of millet is so much lower is
because the seeding rate in general is so
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 21 versus 60 or 80 for some of the
others, and the seeds for millet are quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit smaller than some of the other seed
treatments, so you can plant less of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less expensive, and it's really
driving the trend here for the production
[SPEAKER_00]: per dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also seen here with the millet
sorghum sun hemp produced the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it had the highest production per
dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the challenges that I've
seen when doing this research is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed cost to me seemed pretty prohibitive
for farmers to actually do, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that is because of the seed
economies of scale, so if more people
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted this practice, it would drive down
the price that you would have more
[SPEAKER_00]: suppliers entering the market and
producing varieties that are higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding for this region at a lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, forgot to mention this, the
four-species mixture came out right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle between all the three-species
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some final recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a lot of different metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at weed biomass, weed
suppression, and we looked at the forage
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on the cost, so there are a lot
of different factors in play as to what I
[SPEAKER_00]: would recommend farmers to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to summarize, millet had the greatest
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produced the most biomass, and it was
the lower cost by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millet sorghum sun hemp mixture had the
greatest production of a mixture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also had the lowest cost per
mixture, and had a really high LER and a
[SPEAKER_00]: really high evenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was saying the sun hemp wasn't being
completely dominated by the millet or the
[SPEAKER_00]: sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RFV, the relative feed value,
was near that threshold for lactating
[SPEAKER_00]: cows, so it was the highest producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps with a better forage quality
metric, it would put it into that range of
[SPEAKER_00]: being a good forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The millet sun hemp cow-pea mixture had
the greatest forage quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also the most weed-suppressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that mixture, the millet had the same
growth rate as it did in monoculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not taking a yield loss if you
were going to have the mindset of planting
[SPEAKER_00]: a grass with some additional legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't taking a yield loss there,
but it had a little bit of a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: production cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: To close, I just want to talk a little bit
about some of my PhD work that's also had
[SPEAKER_00]: two growing seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you were wondering,
what about those bi-cultures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, don't worry, they're coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this work, for these experiments,
which are also called SAFE, the Summer
[SPEAKER_00]: Annual Forage Experiments, I'm looking at
monoculture rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: That recommended seeding rate and how it
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're planting, how the biomass
changes at 70% of the seeding rate or 90%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seeding rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, looking at all the bi-culture
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six possible bi-culture
combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than that, more than just looking at
50-50 of millet and sorghum and 50-50 of
[SPEAKER_00]: millet and sun hemp, I'm really looking at
different seeding rate ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: so 20% millet and then 60% sorghum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing that for all six combinations of
bi-cultures to really understand what are
[SPEAKER_00]: the dynamics within the seeding rate
ratios and how does that relate to the
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended seeding rates of these species
in monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will be doing some modeling of the
competition between the intercrops,
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting an intra-specific
competition and inter-specific
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, for some other future work,
I'm going to be doing some farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews, understanding metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in understanding the
metrics for behavior change in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production, so what policies
need to be there that would influence
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer decision making, what barriers
cannot be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is incredibly important and
it's something I'm very interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in that expansion stage of a PhD
where you're saying yes and this and yes
[SPEAKER_00]: and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been condensed yet, but in
general, I'm so interested in science
[SPEAKER_00]: communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship and the communication
between scientists and farmers and
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also interested in agricultural
policy, potentially after a PhD,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe going to Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I will take some time for
questions.

University on the web at cornell.edu.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
