[SPEAKER_02]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Matt, and thank you guys for
the opportunity to share some of what I do
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've been talking about some different
aspects of these projects, it's always an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to do it through a different
lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, I tried to adapt some of what I
have to share to some topics that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: will be especially interesting to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to talk on today,
looking at some new vegetables for organic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, this is going to be some of the
approaches we're taking, so the
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations, things we've done,
and kind of what's coming up next for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever I start to talk about,
and many of my peers start to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: organic systems, breeding for organic
systems, we often spend a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: time focusing on the beginning,
on why would it be different than breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for any other system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the characteristics that are
definitely emphasized when breeding for
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, weed competitiveness comes up,
germination, especially without any
[SPEAKER_00]: protectant fungicides and cold soils where
the plant can be a little slower to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the ground, pest and disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one group is really looking at
in organic systems where you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the pesticide fungicides to be protecting
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we need to work on really
building the plant's resilience to perform
[SPEAKER_00]: in these systems, in the absence of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two, and especially for this
audience, two of the other characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: that are continually important and kind of
fall into another group, they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for some alternatives, some different
approaches to soil health and nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: is plants that can perform better at
getting their nutrients from a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, especially some indeterminate
plants we see really impacted by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some soil building, so cover crops,
things that are an emphasis on ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get some nutrients into the soil
from, if not the crop you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but cover crops in the intervening
seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for organic systems, and two things
that I emphasize is how it's different in
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketplace, so how are you going to
create a crop that there's all the efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: to really contribute to a more sustainable
system, there's labeling to help consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: identify something that's being grown in
more of a sustainable way, but how else
[SPEAKER_00]: can you identify it beyond just the label?
[SPEAKER_00]: So often, many organic consumers,
they're looking for better flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: some diversity, enhanced nutrition,
and so ways you can identify that is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond organic, also non-breeding for
New York, and so I have that just layered
[SPEAKER_00]: on as a second level, where here it's also
looking at the length of the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: season, and is much shorter than in many
other parts of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have different pathogens that are
present or not present in different races,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew on many of the cucurbit
crops, I work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different races, and you'll see
our resistances may perform differently on
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precipitation, this year being one of the
exceptions, but some of my colleagues that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really working on the deeper root
systems to be able to be much more dryland
[SPEAKER_00]: farmed, it's not as much of an issue here,
and sunlight intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of the vegetables I work on,
if you start to look to California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Southwest, there's a lot more sunlight,
so needing to use the foliage of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to shield the fruits from excess sunlight,
that's not a common problem we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ithaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some different considerations
depending on where you're at, and here,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we do trials, where different
plants have been bred in different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for different systems, some of the
differences we see are pretty profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is three reps of a pepper trial
from the organic farm last summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the three rows are the three
different reps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across the bottom, as you go across,
you see the different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these are great red peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a question of are they great
in New York on the organic farming system
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two that are yielding quite a bit were
ones that were bred and selected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast in largely organic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another one on the end,
that one just is one that was selected for
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme early-ness and also is doing well
in our trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see there's some peppers that
are great in California, that when they
[SPEAKER_00]: get translated to Northeast organic,
they're not a good fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the reasons we know why it's there
is to be able to have a pepper that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to excel in California, Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a bunch of different
environmental considerations as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the different diseases that are
the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's either a matter or a
combination of people focusing on needing
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure that those are there in the
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can only work with so many
characteristics at once productively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also often some linkage drag
issues where it's a matter of how much do
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to pick and choose which traits or
how many come along as a package deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same, not to just pick on the
peppers that might have come from Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: and California that aren't the best fit
for our systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take some of our peppers out to
California, we do get some sunscald
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other challenge that often comes up,
you see the black spots here that
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is stiff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a physiological condition in peppers
that we don't see it when we grow them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast, but when we try to send
these peppers to some very hot desert
[SPEAKER_00]: famous pepper production areas of the US,
just some of our lines struggle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond the environment we're handed,
there's also the environment we create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's management and how you can
control the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in high tunnels, one of the big
diseases that's starting to appear more
[SPEAKER_00]: often here in the Northeast and otherwise
isn't much of an issue it's more something
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd find a few states south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternaria is here what's wiping out this
cucumber in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to look at it, you would think
the breeding lines on either side must be
[SPEAKER_00]: much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, here they are much better for the
long haul or the season, but the cucumber
[SPEAKER_00]: in the middle is still the earliest one,
the one to beat in many of the trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it puts out a very early yield,
but the ones flanking it are the sustained
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Matt mentioned, so one of the
things that we look at in these crops is
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make them distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey nut is on the top left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was a mini butter nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit more about later,
but we've just had a variety of cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've developed that to try to make
them noticeable in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've bred them for superior quality,
nutrition, added some disease resistances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to help them stand out in the
marketplace and not just have them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bin of squash to have them sold by name,
if they can be distinctive and if a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer likes it, they can actually go
back and get it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a privilege usually reserved
for apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people know their favorite apple
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some potatoes also fall in the same
category, but otherwise a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: just wouldn't know by market class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to help them stand out in the process,
we can explore some new flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the left, a cucumber that we
released, martini, that is out and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a following now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lacks the typical green skin,
so it's not peeled here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how it comes off the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a very different flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much milder and I enjoy it quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are enjoying the flavor of it
and also habanada or habanero pepper
[SPEAKER_00]: without the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, just to show off some of the
design elements, so the undulating-ness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pepper is actually key to how we can
keep some of the flavor compounds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming out of the white ribs
inside that typically someone would
[SPEAKER_00]: dissect out, throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bell peppers, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many other peppers, that's the
behavior that translates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that's where the flavor is coming
from in these, being able to design in
[SPEAKER_00]: those undulations and how that placental
tissue, the deceipment, appears in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pepper is a way to kind of get around
someone's best intentions as when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to eat it, to really capture,
preserve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within organic, not only are these
things that can also now stand out,
[SPEAKER_00]: is we can continue it as we look at some
other opportunities in snack peppers and
[SPEAKER_00]: also take advantage of one of the things
that we experience in organic systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is really, again, of the
community approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here, as we've been working on these
miniature snacking peppers with some
[SPEAKER_00]: stripes to help them have some more
appeal, the approach we've taken is to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this multi-location recurrent selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a community approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crosses that were done to combine all
the characteristics we were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to combining in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send seed of these segregating
populations out across the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, Montana, Washington,
Oregon, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on farms, research stations and some
participating farms, people will grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: a population, a plot of these peppers
that's segregating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll identify their favorite plants
within that, find a ripe fruit off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: their favorite plants from it,
send it back to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the greenhouse, and I should
credit Lauren Brzezowski with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: this work now, is we will plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plants grow, we will intermate the
progeny from the ones they selected and
[SPEAKER_00]: the next growing season have more seed to
send out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it gives us a way to be able to
sample many different farms across the
[SPEAKER_00]: northern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're growing many peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are looking to see which are the
ones that are excelling on their
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bringing back, we can intermate them
toward hopefully being able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's adapted much more
broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by intermating it every year,
we have a chance to continually combine
[SPEAKER_00]: the best of the best kind of in much more
of an evolutionary sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the results on the way are
we're very excited with, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to stabilize the stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The added bonus of these peppers is
actually the entire plant is variegated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see some of the foliage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this sort of project, it's also key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are peppers, the variegation is
coming from an heirloom, if anyone's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a fish pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the heirloom that was a source of
variegation for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variegation is conferred by a single
recessive gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: These peppers we've selected to be not
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if someone were growing some
jalapenos next to these, you could see how
[SPEAKER_00]: that could otherwise doom the whole
project as we're selecting for flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the variegation is recessive,
even at the seedling stage, as Lauren gets
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds back in the male, sprouts
them, if we see any that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: variegated, we know those are the
out-crosses and she can just discard those
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a way to be able to share the
seed, have it coming back and be sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting just our genetics back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond the pull-through approaches,
a big emphasis is really linking it to
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the current present challenges
growers have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just delicious, not just new
and distinctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting for the consumer, but also really
going to work for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is one of our very important
ones, NOVIC, the Northern Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable Improvement Collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people that are doing many
things, but here are, in reference to the
[SPEAKER_00]: last project, are hosting many of these
recurrent selection projects for the
[SPEAKER_00]: striped peppers and trials where we can
look at performance of varieties broadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A project that Rachel Hultengren and
myself in my lab led was getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the northern U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: just focused on the northeast and really
looking to see what are the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that our local organic sustainable growers
are facing with vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make sure we're calibrated to
their needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been almost a decade since we last
had done this, so we sent out a survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people participated as great in a
working group to go through the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the results, if you're familiar
with vegetables in the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see some parallels where when asked
where are the varieties, the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: crops we should prioritize for continued
improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter squash, tomato, potato were some of
the top ones cited, both for certified
[SPEAKER_00]: organic growers and growers using some
relevant production techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within those, just what are the major
challenges they're facing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, in many of these, again,
if you've grown vegetables in the region,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're also familiar with, and many you've
seen on the news, late blight is one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's commonly discussed, but late
blight, downy mildew on the pathogen side,
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber beetles, flea beetles on the
insect side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within this, this is looking at the
challenges for organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For conventional growers, there would be
some parallels, but again, a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: emphasis here because of the lack of some
of the fungicides or pesticides to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to tackle these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the case when we started
working on cucurbit downy mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mostly a challenge for the organic
growers we were serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with a program specifically
focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the conventional growers, as they've
used a lot of these fungicides to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect against this disease that
really reemerged about a decade ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: not only devastated cucumber production
and pickling cucumber production
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally, it's globally sweeping with
some new races that are really devastating
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cucumber production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the reliance on fungicides
continued when the genetic resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: broke down, it wasn't that many years
before we started to see fungicide
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the work we're doing in
organic systems started to show up as
[SPEAKER_00]: something that was really critical for the
conventional and the organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the symptoms here in this part
of New York, usually it will be in early
[SPEAKER_00]: August.
[SPEAKER_00]: When this will show up, you'll get this
patchwork symptom on the top side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, some diagnostic black sporulation
on the bottom if the conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be very quickly take off a
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from some trials we had with
Jeanine Davis's group in North Carolina,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you see for them, they started to
get some symptoms at the end of July.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 10 days later, the crop is wiped
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have tracked it, some Peter Ojambo's
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you track the spread of the
pathogen, we see it moving from some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pickling production, greenhouse areas,
Michigan, Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get it from the West and also it
overwinters in Florida and then tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: storms and just the ability for it to
colonize cucumber production as the
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumber production every year moves up
the coast, the pathogen follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in New York, we get both,
the one from the West and one from the
[SPEAKER_00]: South.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the resistance, we crossed some
varieties of moderate resistance together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were things we had in seed storage at
Cornell from Henry Munger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others were some cultivars that growers,
organic growers had discovered were
[SPEAKER_00]: working for them moderately, even with the
pathogen around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crossing them together, putting out
large populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ordinarily, this would be a cucumber
pollination nightmare because every plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: to pollinate it, to be able to get seed of
the best, there's several thousand plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can put out in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the season, you can see
there's just maybe one or a few that look
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really combined all those
resistance alleles, loci together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than pollinating everything,
we have a different approach where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a cutting from the most
resistant plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They root very easily in just some wet
potting soil in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they're out of its humidity
bag and growing again, they quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a whole new generation
where we can take the best of the best and
[SPEAKER_00]: just intermate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rather than selfing everything in the
field, this is after we've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, pollinating between those gets
us more toward an evolutionary approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yield are great and even better
than showing you some of the tables of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to show the results as you would
see it in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the top two are our reading lines that
we've developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first to release is the 264,
and the latest is 401.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are available quickly after we
develop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a rapid release program from a
partner in Virginia, Commonwealth Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are getting these out quickly
into some of the most impacted areas as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as we can in incremental releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise, you can see some material
that's either being offered as the best we
[SPEAKER_00]: have in downy mildew resistance otherwise,
and the susceptible, it's easy to see the
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So developed in organic conditions and now
the foundation for a lot of breeding we
[SPEAKER_00]: have for conventional systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not lack for striped cucumber
beetles, especially with a mild winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a sign of things to come if we
continue to have mild winters more
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumber beetles can overwinter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a specialist herbivore of
cucurbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are strongly attracted to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process of eating the plants
and in the flowers especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: by eating, during eating the tissue,
there's some bitter compounds within
[SPEAKER_00]: cucurbits, cucurbitacins that they're
actually sequestering and using as a
[SPEAKER_00]: protectant to prevent themselves from
predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are very few natural enemies
of these insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can just really explode
unchecked, especially on an organic farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a conventional farm, there's many
neonicotinoid formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are used to be able to protect the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenges, one of the most attractive
parts of the plant for the beetles is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers where you're getting all the
protein in the pollen, loads of very sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: nectar in every flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a situation where
pollinators and pests are both being
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to the same place at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so needing to specifically target one
insect without harming doing collateral
[SPEAKER_00]: damage on the other is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially for organic systems and on
the horizon perhaps for a conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: system, some alternatives are really
crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, in organic systems,
there's a practice that's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Northeast especially, it gets used
some added earliness to a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have some high value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, here as we're using row cover
to physically exclude the beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's questions about how you scale this
up and how much polypropylene can you use
[SPEAKER_00]: on what scale and be sustainable in terms
of both the actual physical process of it
[SPEAKER_00]: also, the petrochemicals that are involved
in the synthesis of the plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now unlike many others that have worked on
cucumber beetles in squash before,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started to do a lot of variety assays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at everything that's available to
an organic grower that's going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: well on their farm and to see which plants
are more or less preferred toward making
[SPEAKER_00]: some recommendations of what someone could
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see there's some distinct
patterns you see where the beetles have
[SPEAKER_00]: left some plots alone and others are
blitzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the extremes of that, one of the
reproducible extremes we get is on the top
[SPEAKER_00]: is a summer squash that the cucumber
beetles essentially leave alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given no choice if we put them in a cage
or that they typically will only eat a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple plants out of all the ones in the
cage and so they're really not something
[SPEAKER_00]: they're preferring to eat versus on the
bottom, one of the extreme examples of a
[SPEAKER_00]: zucchini that they don't leave much at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants they don't eat,
the feeding and the process, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: seed transmitted viruses that they also
can carry and bacterial wilt will give you
[SPEAKER_00]: the collateral damage if the defoliation
wasn't bad enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we went through looking for
patterns in this, and so the key for us is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many cultivars we can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year there's more cultivars coming
out and so if we can try to find patterns
[SPEAKER_00]: to help explain this, then we don't have
to continually keep trialing everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so looking at all the eight market
classes in cucurbit of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: one species where it's everything from
summer squash, acorn, delicata,
[SPEAKER_00]: paddy, pen, jack-o-lantern, zucchinis,
there's a pattern emerges within between
[SPEAKER_00]: market classes where there's a definite
gradient in the field if we let this go,
[SPEAKER_00]: the damage on the cocazelles I assure you
would be more than 14% defoliation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for this experiment that's where we
cut it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So additionally as we start to look at it
from more of a biological perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: right there, and there's two distinct
groups for damage, is where it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the division from the subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one subspecies, cucurbit of people,
Texana, includes all the market classes on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beetles tend to do less damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones on the bottom, they do a lot of
damage on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is some guidance for us and
how we understand to make recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going to be investing in OMRI
certified pesticides or row cover,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of where your investment is best
placed, we can do crosses between the two
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies to be able to work toward
having some new cultivars where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: take that non-preference and bring it back
into the zucchinis, the more highly
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred subspecies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's some leave,
they're leaving entirely alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some they make into lace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the basis and really what's going on,
I have a lot of interest in then how this
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts some consumer decisions and how
consumer decisions impact this in turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the most highly preferred squash
we found is the golden zucchini on your
[SPEAKER_00]: left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The least damaged, kind of the most
sustainable to grow is the one nearest me,
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: On many levels, there's not a lot of
differences here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a supermarket, they'd have different
inventory skews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some different preferences,
some different handling practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the one nearest me tends to be
a little bit more scarred, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to be a little bit more higher
yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one for the zucchini tends to be a
higher value and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these two different subspecies
domesticated independently is where it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets the most interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the aspects of this
I've spent a while digging into because
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully this is going to explain how we
structure the search and the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two domestication events for
cucurbitid people, texana was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: southeast, cucurbitid people, subspecies
people was in the southwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting the summer squash and
pumpkin market classes at those two
[SPEAKER_00]: different domestication events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll know that zucchini isn't on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because I said Tony isn't here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an Italian invention, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's when the summer squash,
especially the crookneck summer squash,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that people Harry Paris
and some others have spent a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depictions, the drawings, the
paintings people did of new crops coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back from the new world to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one I'm aware of they found
for summer squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the crookneck straight neck summer
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some scallops they found,
but this is something that really never
[SPEAKER_00]: made it out of the new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Striped cucumber beetles on the east
coast, very heavy pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's stayed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other subspecies, however,
is it got to Italy that was recognized as
[SPEAKER_00]: a great replacement for some of the other
cucurbits they were growing to eat when
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruit were still young.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Italy, it was the most emphasis on
some of the breeding and selection where
[SPEAKER_00]: we ended up with, as you can tell by the
name, we have the Romanesco squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these are the first zucchini and
coccasal squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selected in Italy away from at
least the cucur beetles we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: the insects of this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't actually make it back into
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: until they showed up in some seed catalogs
on the 1920s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's this extended period where
these were being selected independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might explain why they especially
are the most vulnerable having lost much
[SPEAKER_00]: of the resistance to this U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: North America pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, though, there's still
some other characteristics we're
[SPEAKER_00]: interested for disease resistance here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the southwest is where there's
one of the other diseases I work on a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: phytophthora blight with Chris Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was first discovered, and the most
aggressive strains are in New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite near to the domestication of the
subspecies where we also happen to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the most resistance genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, as we're starting to look
at the influence of people on
[SPEAKER_00]: domestication and how we've changed
varieties, and then understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: context that they've been selected and
evolved in, you can see how it has some
[SPEAKER_00]: tie-ins to the selection work we're doing
in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, that we have some more fine-scale
information, exactly what happens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: squash, we're spending a lot of our effort
to understand what has changed between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two subspecies, what was selected for or
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: In P, we happen to know there's some
adaptive mutations that have been selected
[SPEAKER_00]: against in domestication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lecture in plant genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about Mendel's genes in
there, of course, for flower color is
[SPEAKER_00]: often the most described Mendel's aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a typical P, almost every cultivar
you'll see, they'll have white flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A white-flowered P has been selected to
have white flowers because along with
[SPEAKER_00]: white flowers, you have a loss of
anthocyanin throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you remove the ability to turn
on the anthocyanin and all the flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathway, you then remove any
of the correlated bitter or astringency
[SPEAKER_00]: with all those other flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, jump to this one,
if you do, though, reintroduce the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: flower character, so whether you have the
loss or presence capacity for anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis, once you have anthocyanins
turned on in the flower, you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: anthocyanins, other flavonoids throughout
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've selected for some, I'll go back
to the other slide, that have more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more intensity in the anthocyanin
accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to see it throughout the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the process of selecting for
plants, what started out as more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: aesthetic, just a lot of purple pigment in
the pod to try to create something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just much more colorful, nutritious by
having all these extra antioxidants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: By actually going back and making the
decision we want to put back anthocyanin
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesis in the plant, we want to have
these colored flowers, we want to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: try to work around the bitterness and
astringency rather than just have it lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are much more fit in their
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remove the flavonoid biosynthesis
anthocyanins, the plants are much more
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to heat, they are much more
susceptible to diseases for cool weather,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more pest pathogens, essentially once
you have a green potted pea, a white
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered pea plant, you have removed all
of its natural chemical defenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only are we selecting for this,
what we're seeing in the foliage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to note, and especially to
share with this audience, there's one part
[SPEAKER_00]: that's easy for us plant breeders to
forget about, and that's everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many phytoelectrons that
were first characterized in pea and
[SPEAKER_00]: studied that their production really
depends on the plant's capacity to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids, and for us being able to have
our fun to create these purple potted peas
[SPEAKER_00]: that are definitely easier to pick,
easier to find in the plant, much more
[SPEAKER_00]: compelling to the consumer, but this is a
plant that's actually much more fit and
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to many natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last vignette to end with,
in many of these different examples I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been showing and being able to share seeds
out across the northern U.S., get them
[SPEAKER_00]: back, cross everything together as we find
the survival of the fittest out for downy
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew in the cucumber patch, bring in the
survivors, intermate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've really been making a push,
and that's something my program is new to
[SPEAKER_00]: my program, towards this recurrent
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of organic seed communities,
there's an emphasis on open pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, something where that seed
saving is promoted, encouraged,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the process of having OPs and
actually for someone breeding OPs,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining them, you need them widely
isolated, because otherwise you'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: have every different cultivar you're
trying to maintain mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in terms of the breeding
infrastructure, it's pretty much pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to work on multiple OPs to
produce seed of them, and so the approach
[SPEAKER_00]: we had previously was of just the pedigree
method, where we make a cross in the F2,
[SPEAKER_00]: we select the best, and then we're selfing
everything from then on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very handy, and I can work on
many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've gone past the fields in
Freeville, you've seen many different
[SPEAKER_00]: things going on, many different examples
of each crop species, but we can only make
[SPEAKER_00]: so much gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do one cross, so we find the best plant
in the F2, and then we're stabilizing from
[SPEAKER_00]: there, unless we do other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other challenges with it, the hand
pollination, we're biasing the phenotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pulling off anything that's set on
the weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gooderman in the greenhouses, it's not as
much as it used to be, but as you see all
[SPEAKER_00]: the few curbit vines trellised up,
that's all my crops, we have a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: winter generation, like 1% of the plants
we have in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't really select in there,
because it's in no way recapitulating a
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer's field in upstate New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many squash you'll see hanging
from the rafters in bags, it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in place of that, if there's a way to
know beforehand which of the plants we
[SPEAKER_00]: could be crossing together, we could
actually be doing hand pollinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in the greenhouse, on the field,
of just the plants we wanted to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've made a push into genomic
selection, that at first I was doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with some trepidation, and now what crop
am I not trying to think we should do this
[SPEAKER_00]: process with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cross honey nut bugle to squash
that we knew complemented each other very
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through the F2 population,
and then just further intimated those,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just put 200 plants in the field for a
training population, about the same size
[SPEAKER_00]: we would for that F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from then on, once we have that
population genotyped, and we do a careful
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotyping, that's when the computer
model can take over from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each subsequent generation we genotype 200
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hernandez in my group finds the best
10 to 20 of those, we intermate those,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we just have these recurring
cycles of genomic selection where the
[SPEAKER_00]: computer can be selecting what are going
to be the best plants from that every year
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to intermate in just a small
portion of the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hits home if you've seen the scale
that we harvest some things at,
[SPEAKER_00]: so several tons of squash a year
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through the fields,
every plant, bagging, counting,
[SPEAKER_00]: weighing, analyzing, many of them all
chopped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you, and Leland, have shared
some of our technology to just try to help
[SPEAKER_00]: automate the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have some USB input on some of
these devices that have helped speed the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, but still is not nearly as
efficient as just knowing beforehand which
[SPEAKER_00]: would be the best plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, the process is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really enjoying the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the success, I'll admit,
as we work on squash, quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the major things we're looking at
is color, sweetness, a smooth starchy
[SPEAKER_00]: texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bricks is our way to measure the total
soluble solids, really well correlated to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry matter is quite well correlated to the
starch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And A star is a color space value
correlated to how red something is,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the darker the orange there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that some of these are
quite well correlated, bricks and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good and, more importantly,
positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other correlations are weaker,
but still at least they are not negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can select for the whole suite
of quality characteristics at once with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that it's within a
crop where we know it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the new consumer traits I
mentioned that are, I think, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting and they're starting to see in
the seed catalogs, really starting to take
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something where our first success
story here, Honey Nut, is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: really was our proof that these methods
are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is it something that is being
sold by name with its own skew,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also something that we've been able
to build in some quality assurances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, the habanada pepper
that has the undulation, so the flavor is
[SPEAKER_00]: not easily removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a squash where in a typical
butternut squash, it's hard to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're getting something that's
ripe or just simply picked when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: full size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey Nut, some of the design elements,
so it does have this green to orange color
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can tell if you're getting one
that's fully ripe, and that will help make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure everyone that buys it is getting what
they were hoping they were purchasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has just been one great success
story for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so continuing to work through the
genomic selection within this is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best ways we have to be able to
tackle many different projects and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: fill a void of some locally successful
regionally adapted organic produce that's
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully going to be a great new tool for
our grower partners and also for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that can take the produce home or grow it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, a bunch of people to thank.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work Lauren Brasowski has
done with the cucumber beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: striped peppers, downy mildew,
along with Bill Holdsworth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian Lecky, also a postdoc working a lot
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Hernandez doing the genomic
selection work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rachel Hultengren in my lab also is a big
contributor on lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the needs assessment surveys in
Novick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marianne, Paige, Emily, Sarah are keeping
everything moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emily, I'll note, took many of the
pictures I had to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new postdoc, Spring, joining us to help
us understand more about the speciation
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a lot of great support from
our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the chance to come and
share this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wondering, you had mentioned earlier
on some of the sort of soil type of
[SPEAKER_03]: selections and factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been seeing with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biggest one we see is whether you
have a determinate or indeterminate plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this with our peppers and we
see it with squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some pictures at home where I
overdid it in a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the vegetables they work with,
especially the indeterminate ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a key transition from the juvenile
growth stage to the reproductive flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Determinate plants, especially we see a
lot of bell peppers that have been really
[SPEAKER_00]: bred to be able to take a lot of nitrogen
fertilizer, can really translate that into
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit production.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you work with some more wilder species
or some less adapted land races,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you give them a sustained nitrogen
release, like you'd have with compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a plant that is getting that slow
release constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, this is my hypothesis about
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we always see with when it's kind
of that slow release nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a plant that just keeps growing,
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not get any fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might get some flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow habaneros that are almost
shoulder high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Habanero plants, no fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see this response as something that
it's typically otherwise if you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional fertility and you could adapt
it for organics where you have an initial
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fertilization for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as that tapers off and the plant
makes the transition at flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can do that second, in a side
dress or herdigate some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the things we see also in
the same is true for bush versus binding
[SPEAKER_00]: squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in our experience where the more
of a bush determinate plant habit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can make that reproductive transition,
even with getting a lot of nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_00]: that slow release compost on a very high
organic matter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some very high organic matter soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a dairy feedlot for decades and
then was a pasture for decades after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil, I think, is quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic matter is really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fertility hasn't added anything in a
few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge for me is now when I do add
it, I really see that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges with having a binding squash to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because there is so much fertility
built up in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a bush squash, I don't notice
any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just quickly and productively grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the things that I wish
from the soil perspective I knew more
[SPEAKER_00]: about and it's a phenomenon we've observed
and we're even for people that also have
[SPEAKER_00]: an interest in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, I planted the honey nut a
few years ago and for me, it was so sweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that tendency with a few other
crops, particularly sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: where sometimes so sweet, they're like
candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if you see generational
differences in consumers in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding for sweetness or something lower
on the sweetness scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a question about the flavor and
sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, there's a relationship that we do
work with and we're aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that there's definitely
cultural differences in the preferences
[SPEAKER_00]: for sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's also, throughout someone's
life, you go through different phases
[SPEAKER_00]: where sweet tooth and different flavor
from like lollipops to coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that, so that'd be some of the
generational differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other cultures use these in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they selected for very high starch,
low sweetness for different culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: applications to hold together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many different things to do and
ways to explore the flavor space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very easy to just select for
sweetness and lose a lot of the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many people talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we still do a lot of taste
testing and often we'll be going towards
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is kind of the richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, it's the gents we have,
the nutrition and the sweetness and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthfeel go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's opportunities to go anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that's why we have a lot of
collaborations with the chef and Barbara
[SPEAKER_00]: to help us interpret some of the space and
be able to get some leadership in where to
[SPEAKER_00]: take things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Michael, I'm just curious about the
trades for organic production and weed
[SPEAKER_04]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really interested in your
example with these purple pea,
[SPEAKER_04]: where it was desirable for consumers,
but it also had some maybe pest
[SPEAKER_04]: suppression or pest tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had any examples where you found
a trade that would be desirable to
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers, but also contributed to weed
suppression?
[SPEAKER_04]: Desirable to consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like where you had that purple pea and you
had some pest suppression there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it seems like it might be a little bit
harder with the weed parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so typically when we meet into
the region, we are looking at clothing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be competitive,
faster growing competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the keys have to be some attention to
the weeding to be able to have it be
productive.
But the purple flower, everyone's
definitely concerned.
They grow faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically we're looking at how to make
a plant compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would it be more amenable to each
other, or how to make something grow
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast to smother.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with some of the mining squash that's
working for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering what all the
objectives did you have for the quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones are you more challenged by?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is more difficult, to improve the
flavors or to deal with a tough disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work with Downing Hill Loop,
there's been some ease of the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: there just because for us we're getting a
mixture of the pathogens across the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: For better or for worse, arriving here
late in the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to just look for the
survivors, being able to find the green,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the fields, there's a lot of work
up into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very easy to identify which is
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the taste good, and the high
yielding, and working in other
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that becomes challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of the flavor work, sometimes we
get something quickly to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's often a lot of tasting,
a lot of squash, or a lot of peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through and tasting hundreds of
peppers a few different times to really
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out which are the best tasting
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only working with ones that are
not hot, so that helps, but you've got to
kiss a lot of frogs to find the prints
there.
Because you're working with flavor,
and it's all spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just from okay to good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're putting everything in motion,
all the new characteristics, and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: permutations of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we filter some things just using
bricks, which is something kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness.
