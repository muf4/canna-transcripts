[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production of Cornell
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are all about to go into
finals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of impressed that you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a total load of crap dumped on
me when I left the farm today because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all planting trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can all just be glad that we're in
this little cocoon together for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have heard of the Finger
Lake Cider House?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let me start with, how many have you
been to the Finger Lake Cider House?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many have you heard of Good Life Farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a utter failure, let me just say,
of the Cider House.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with that at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'll tell you a little bit about
myself first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Melissa Madden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated from Cornell in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was the, whatever you guys are
calling that position now, the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farm coordinator at Cornell from 2008 to
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, Betsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, my husband and I
bought our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had spent a number of years
apprenticing for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of in 2007, something kind
of like, so that doesn't actually sound
[SPEAKER_00]: that long, from 2004 to 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, we're done working for other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't possibly do this another minute
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're both really lucky to get really
good jobs that were not like
[SPEAKER_00]: apprenticeships in agriculture anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband was originally a very
well-trained carpenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he became the production manager at
Snug Planet, which you've heard of as a
[SPEAKER_00]: great revolution in energy efficiency for
housing in Tompkins County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got the job that Betsy now has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really pivotal for us,
because we were immediately able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: loans and buy a piece of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time looking for a
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of time is super relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 24 or 25, and he was 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every month that went by felt like
a greater emergency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came back from an apprenticeship in
December of 2007, applied for these jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We somehow miraculously got them by
January of 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by March of 2008, we had an offer
on a piece of property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, that took so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just agonizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start farming right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the funny thing was, this is the
land we bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not on our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no infrastructure at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took till June to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put an offer in in March and took
till June to close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put a little yurt here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who've been there maybe have
heard of it or seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of across this little creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we filled some trees and built a
bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time we closed,
this entire farm was planted to
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional wheat and soybeans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was it for us for the year of
having any control over our property,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a really interesting and
difficult experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were coming at it with these
extreme, I would say, views about the way
[SPEAKER_00]: we wanted to manage land and the changes
that we wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I'm kind of making so much
fun of our sense of time is that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been, over the past 10 years, expanded and
expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we wanted to have a permaculture
paradise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows what permaculture means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone care to offer a definition?
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of started forgetting what I
usually say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anyone else want to throw
something out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, there's two things going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you just said I would personally
say is a tool, which is perennial
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what the concept is that goes
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the most common
interpretation of permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone else want to take a stab at it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you don't feel like I just shot you
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a mistake once when I first met my
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was giving a talk on soil science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said something that I thought was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in front of the entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't believe we got married.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone want to take a stab?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really important for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Design approach for what was sustainable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big overarching one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to say life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's three little things that
we like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone know what they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very codified in the permaculture
lexicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earth care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a very embarrassing moment where I
forgot one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair share and people care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone disagree with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have your hand up?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is where a lot of
permaculturists end up, is that this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really direct line in terms of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I'm excited to talk about is
how once your business gets more mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually maybe start to feel like you
can address these things, these other two
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is definitely where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can imagine, we're sitting we're
like camping, basically living in a yurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we still live in 10 years later,
which is a problem under this,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like you should have a house
after 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were watching this farming system
that we very vehemently disagreed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anyone heard of Cayuga Pure Organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: These things pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we find out how old we are,
Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was like hot shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cayuga Pure Organics is where I met my
husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a grain farm that was making
really big waves in Brooktondale because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were vertically integrating in the
way that older grain farms used to,
[SPEAKER_00]: processing their own grain instead of
selling it to a much larger mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in Green Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone was trying to figure out how
to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was one of the original cleaners of
beans there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Viva Taqueria would get these
incredible bags of beans from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have to spend a lot of time
pulling the rocks out because we were not
[SPEAKER_00]: that great at what we were doing
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of those things that
in farming that way, that was a certified
[SPEAKER_00]: organic operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time there was a rain event,
like you can imagine for most of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like a ton of exposed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a really distressing thing
to be part of and witness and perpetuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember in 2000, so this is for a
full year, we weren't able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent ground cover on our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying, I eat annual
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eat annual grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, no, I'm saying that's not
how we wanted to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to push the boundaries as much
as possible of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were seeing that most of the
people practicing this were practicing it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a hobby scale, definitely under five
acres and mostly under one acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to know if it's an actual
farming system that could be applied to a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a 69-acre parcel, 45 acres of
open fields and 24 acres of woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we felt like this was like this great
blank slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This from here to here is honey-oy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know very much about that
soil type?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the state soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for knowing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's delicious, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's actually a sweet soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very deep and very loamy and
incredibly rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from here down is Casanova.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does anyone know anything about
Casanova?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a really good ag soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing compares to honey-oy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our two flagship ciders are now named
those two things in terms of the failure
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tasting room to tell you those
things that you don't know about our farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't know that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were thinking, OK, we have this
great farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good base.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to show what 69 acres can do
in terms of perennial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we had to wait a year just to
plant the ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in March of 2009, there was this huge
rain event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember just standing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the crops had been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was very little residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were no living roots in the
ground and very few even previous year
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like an 8% slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree, Tom?
[SPEAKER_00]: From here to here, slipping down towards
Cayuga Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you see these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone know what these are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like the dips in the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see how they're even in this time
of year, which you can see this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: really early spring, how dark green they
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how much less soil is on the
top of these ridges here than in these
[SPEAKER_00]: valleys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our big goal was to stop that right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember in March of 2009 just
totally freaking out, standing here and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching all this topsoil go this way and
being like, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to lie down and put some straw
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a tiny little person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is 69 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was nothing I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then luckily, by May, we had gotten
the whole thing planted to grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ran into my friend who is a grain
farmer who has spoken here, and I will not
[SPEAKER_00]: say his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was so, so annoyed because he was
like, I really wish you would have rented
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm to me while you figured your
shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, it's already figured
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have saved the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very successful moment to
plant grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then quickly in succession,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I made good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In April of 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so you remember this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it basically looks like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like a very excellent graphic
designer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a PowerPoint mockup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I see that it says 2013 on the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess what I'll say is we continue
to plant trees all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire farm is green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just learned that there's actually a
new Google shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably should have put that in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, what you can see is that
the only part of our farm at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: that remains in annual tillage agriculture
is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the flattest spot on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's six high tunnels, five of which are
movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all five of those have three rotations
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And otherwise, everything's covered in
grass and asparagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been planting fruit trees since
2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2010, we planted asparagus in 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was in a desert,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nothing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is 2010 planting trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what teamwork looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of what it looks like now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or actually, that's 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those trees are much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's covered in trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some places where there's a
little bit of tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's done with horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, do you think that
we've been able to, I'm just looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: some more pictures, been able to make a
living off of this farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a head shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you have already heard this from
me, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: My doom and gloom story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been warned not to be too negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the problems I think you run
into when you have really big ideas and
[SPEAKER_00]: you think that you, in and of yourself,
are a grand solution is that sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: can really fail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing about this farm,
I love my farm so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, we raise beef cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have organic asparagus, organic
peaches, organic apples, organic Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: pears, specialty greens, which showed you
a picture of specialty ginger,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we make into a house-made soda,
and then poultry sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the place that the Good Life
Farm is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that it'll be like a
whole other generation before that farm is
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I find more challenging every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I mentioned is still
living in basically a shack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what a lot of people find
hilarious about that is that this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back to these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what order these, this is our
building, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we built that ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're infinitely capable of actually
building a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that we have
constantly struggled against is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that we want to make the biggest
possible positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realized that we weren't able to be
full time on our own operation with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything being based in perennial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways, like I would say,
cows are perennial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we raise a cow-calf herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always working off of our own
mothers only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every year, I have one new mother to
add to my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means one additional cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ideally, an operation that would cash
flow would be like 100 cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone want to take a guess about how
many I have in my painful years of
[SPEAKER_00]: building my herd?
[SPEAKER_00]: 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that we needed to vertically
integrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anyone here come to the farm
regression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have heard from them before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those guys are two of my best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really important mentors in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things they do for
me really well is make fun of me all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought this was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things about their vertical
integration, did Greg come with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did Farmer Ground Flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Osher Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the best run organic grain
farms you're ever going to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible crop rotation plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supporting the beginning of Farmer Ground
Flower, which is a really high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: grain mill that is designed to source
locally, especially from Osher Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then White Awake Bakery, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The differences are three separate
businesses run by three separate owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we did was we tried
to vertically integrate within our own
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we've got Good Life
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really important that that's the
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, we are able to make a little
bit more of our cider from our own
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, we're only at 20% in a good
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a farm cidery,
which actually have a farm winery license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is great because it means we can
take these apples that were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look super gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, the variety is weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you guys are a really neat crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like Yarlington Mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ellis Bitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Davenet.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not terribly well-known
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're great to grow in an organic
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, again, like going back to like not
only the fact that it's perennial,
[SPEAKER_00]: but how do you want to manage your
perennial agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what do you want your rotation of
inputs to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want the things that you have
to purchase to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people tend to assume that
permaculture farms are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems like a natural assumption
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still personally think it's very
important to be certified if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something we should be
self-certifying, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's really hard to do and takes a
lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, people will mix
biodynamics with permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's also a great mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, it's sort of silly at this
point that we haven't certified biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the integration of animals on
our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't do the preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't do the full thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got this farm winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's justified by the existence of our
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, in New York State,
you could be a farm winery or farm brewery
[SPEAKER_00]: without producing a single piece of the
commodity yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apples are still considered a
commodity, which in and of itself is an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly difficult part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you all are familiar maybe with the
Lake Ontario sort of apple belt?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool up there, anyone driven
along, and just miles and miles and miles
[SPEAKER_00]: of apple orchards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys, for years, this is slowly
changing because of the hard cider
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who do you think they were selling to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mots.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what price?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like $0.85, maybe $0.30 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to even start to turn around we
need to charge $2 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little better when we just use
it in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets a lot better when we turn
it into alcohol and put it in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not very earth-friendly at all,
and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that most cideries are
making their apples out of the previous
[SPEAKER_00]: construct that I just mentioned,
which is extremely cheap fruit and not
[SPEAKER_00]: very high quality fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this messaging going on about
cider being awesome and farm-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, cider is farm-related.
[SPEAKER_00]: It at some point comes from an apple,
maybe, except for the ones that didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made from malic acid and all this
kind of weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can read that right on the
ingredients on the bottle, so I don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to mention any names.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of cideries making cider
with really cheap fruit and dressing it up
[SPEAKER_00]: really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you come into the Finger Lake Cider
House, I hope that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some glimpse of what we're trying to do,
which is stand for the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to kind of pedal back
and say, what is the Finger Lake Cider
[SPEAKER_00]: House?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, it's the tasting room that
most of you have been into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tasting room for Good Life
Cider, which is from Good Life Farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not an estate cidery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not 100% around fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very important to us to be
working towards that, which is why my crew
[SPEAKER_00]: is at home planting 900 more trees right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you are leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's three other cideries in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redbird Orchard, has anyone heard of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is the Cornell Orchards manager here
at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he owns Redbird Orchard Cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the smallest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Diamond Cider, everyone's heard of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ian Merwin was a professor of pomology
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eve Cidery, anyone heard of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's actually the person that I met in
2000 when I discovered that farming was
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, because I worked for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I didn't realize she was
almost my age.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was 21, and I was 19.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ageless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel really lucky, because she's
been my mentor since 2000, and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: making cider that entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she actually qualifies as one of the
longest-running, sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: method-Champanoise cideries in the
country, and is very nationally recognized
[SPEAKER_00]: for her quality, and struggles enormously
to get the price that she needs to get for
[SPEAKER_00]: her cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's 75% her own fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between the four of us, that's the
story we're trying to tell in the cider
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cider house has its own super
conundrum of collaboration is awesome,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not if the risk isn't shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole bunch of stuff about
that that has been very confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I keep coming back to is,
if we're trying to support small family
[SPEAKER_00]: farms who are truly producing their own
fruit, and paying a lot of attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the microbial makeup on the skin
of this fruit, and how is it going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: our cider really interesting and really
delicious, we have to be telling our story
[SPEAKER_00]: as loudly as some of our competitors who
have a marketing budget, any marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: person, and who are not paying almost
anything for juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everybody showed us a lot of,
in 2014, when we presented the idea to
[SPEAKER_00]: those other cideries, they showed us a lot
of faith, because we were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, our farm is a great place for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can build the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can find the funding, which is crazy
that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will run the tasting room for all
of us, on all of our behalfs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over that time, it's become really
clear to my husband and I, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard in my story so far,
is there any background in hospitality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I mention any background in
hospitality?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea what we were getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just sure that we could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking to Stefan last night,
actually, and it's funny, because I told
[SPEAKER_00]: him I was coming here, and he didn't tell
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd give it a talk, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, Stefan, my head is
scrambled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what he told me to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, ask me about my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me what inspires me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask me what terrifies me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't done that yet, but that's
kind of where I'd like to leave it at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point, and open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope we can have the rest of this
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really do my slideshow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really concerned with my slideshow
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go through the rest of the pictures
if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to just talk to you guys,
and I hope I kind of laid out what our
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you ran into me at 4 o'clock and
asked me how I was doing, and I was like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This continues to be what inspires me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of my cow herd being
followed by my turkey flock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel really, really strongly about
the kind of agriculture we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel really, really well educated
about how expensive it is to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my original cow herd.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were three animals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two of them were female, and one of
them we ate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is like, yay, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I bought a couple more moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, 2012, get to 18, just my own
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like, so this gives me a chance
to say, people often ask me, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: did you go to Cornell for farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, Tom, but I was like,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I was an undergrad here,
the class that I took that resonated the
[SPEAKER_00]: most with me was Tom Whitlow's class.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys know him,
but he's my old advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's my dear friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He teaches a class called Restoration
Ecology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was where I was at for my entire
career as a student here, was much more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in the natural world than the
agricultural world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, every summer,
I was working on farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on a remembrance farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at Stickenstone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for Indian, not Indian Creek,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't own it anymore, the sister farm
to Indian Creek that is no longer Sister
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, where Autumn was, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in Newfield, on Schaeffer Road.
[SPEAKER_00]: The James Cummins started, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not called the obituary, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that whole time, I was thinking
like, this is fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't make their money this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't make a living this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, the people I was working
for were either still working full time
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs off farm or part time jobs or just
struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those farms have all evolved to be
full family operations at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never really thought agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just always thought restoration or
conservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was finding out about
permaculture that really turned that
[SPEAKER_00]: corner for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting in lots and lots of
arguments with grain and vegetable farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: about what jerks permaculturists could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would say like 10 years ago,
the movement was in a different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot more antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a much better
recognition from the permaculture side
[SPEAKER_00]: about the value of these small organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel really lucky, Paul,
that I have my animals to wake up to every
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what has evolved, and I would say
yes, my inspiration has worn thin because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've turned into a master administrator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all the staff management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 17 employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I account for the fact that we have no
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, I still have livestock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do the chores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the morning and in the evening,
I'm still a farmer, whether I can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a farmer in the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we've gotten kind of
pounded in the cider house by attention
[SPEAKER_00]: and our lack of experience, I keep
realizing that people still tend to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys have all been there and
you didn't know about the Good Life Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's pretend that what I'm saying is
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can tell me it's not later.
[SPEAKER_00]: People know that they're on a working farm
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that feels different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they see that we treat our place
like with a lot of reverence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it tends to be one of the best
educational experiences a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: can have, which is why we have this
festival, which is a Memorial Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're all welcome to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a asparagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been having it for six years
because we planted two acres of asparagus,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are curious, it is four miles of
walking if one person has to harvest it by
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never do that ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I had a mental breakdown
once in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's like a four to five person
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think what I need to do better
to keep myself happy is be out there
[SPEAKER_00]: giving farm tours and explaining this to
people so that that proportion of hand
[SPEAKER_00]: raising, let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knew about the Finger Lake Cider
House?
[SPEAKER_00]: And before this, who knew about the Good
Life Farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I feel like it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're all cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed to me like it was half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to do a better job with
that because we want to connect people to
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of what they're tasting to
something that's real and something they
[SPEAKER_00]: can support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an incredible capitalist
construct, that we would use our dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: our purchasing dollars, to make things
better for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, in the cider house,
it is totally true for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has totally worked out that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, did that answer your question or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to ask it again, John?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you wanted to ask who inspired you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a picture of it somewhere beside
of you with your horses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was wondering if you could tell
people what your motivation was to have
[SPEAKER_02]: horses for your family and for other
people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 2009 to May of last year,
so not quite a year, we did not have a
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we moved grain, really big
quantities of grain, for our turkeys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved our turkeys all over the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like their feeding vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the days I would move it,
I would load it up in between the wheels
[SPEAKER_00]: and move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the turkeys were like, yes,
this is so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are so happy about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't see it, but they actually
are fenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't invest that much in livestock
and then not fence them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that was a nice
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I just sort of feel like
everything we did was a light touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the problems was we were also
touching our compost very lightly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which meant that we weren't flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And enough and we weren't making very nice
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we started to have apple pomace
coming off the presses, it was like a
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate issue that turned into a rat
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were starting to get these
bottle orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made 7,500 gallons, which is
nothing, like last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is your sun making?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eve cidery capped out at 10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redbird never makes more than three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Diamond made three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that would make Eve's the biggest,
us the next, and the other two just so
[SPEAKER_00]: much smaller, just for a proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, do you have any statistics on
wineries in your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't touch the wineries around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even a small winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having a very hard time getting
people to recognize a $15 to $20 price
[SPEAKER_00]: point for our product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where in the hell are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I going with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing with always wanting to do
everything the hardest possible way and
[SPEAKER_00]: the most labor intensive possible way is
at some point it gets really expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started really measuring it or
losing out on the opportunity to get
[SPEAKER_00]: really good freight rates for our bottles
because we couldn't order them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity because we couldn't unload them,
that became an issue where we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I started to have a
separation of, I would say, direction with
[SPEAKER_00]: my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, the horses are my
animals and I have to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that, did everyone experience
those rain storms last Wednesday,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday, and Friday?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I ran out of hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cows aren't on grass quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been waiting for it to get to a
certain height because they'll just mow it
[SPEAKER_00]: down right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to get hay out to my cows on
Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of driving a tractor in that
is like, you're committing to ruts for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to load it onto this sled,
which is not in this picture, and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the pasture and no damage done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always, it's nice to have
something that's four footed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get through anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can jump over a log.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can jump over a log.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have legitimate jobs for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled 200 locust posts out of our
woods over the past two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: On behalf of them, we pulled out with the
horses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in a creek or behind a tree
under a bush, really hard to get with a
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor, or way too big for a human to
lift onto the tractor forks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I insist on doing the tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, Melissa's doing her
hobby right now, her farm work hobby,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's half as efficient at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, because once you have a
tractor, you're in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you have implements for your
tractor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lucky thing, I feel like,
is we own no implements for our tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, we don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one of those difficult things
where he's going in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically am like, well,
they'll just be mine then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be my hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any horse farms, again,
correct me if I'm wrong, that are either
[SPEAKER_00]: not split up.
How
[SPEAKER_00]: often are you shot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, like, slaughtering them on the
farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are shot on and bled out on farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're butchered off farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very specific way to do it,
which is called custom cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means that we sign up all of our
customers while they're still alive,
[SPEAKER_00]: agree on a cut sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pay a deposit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, they own the animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows us to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a super beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have 100 cows,
because I don't want to stop being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really value the lack of
transport before slaughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm way too intimate with my cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want to see another picture of a
really cute little guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did he go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so great when they're.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is just born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, hello, here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me stab you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me castrate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put a tag in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a day later, there's no catching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cannot get a hold of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the beginning of calving
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our farm, from now until the middle
of June, it's sort of like running a
[SPEAKER_00]: sprint for the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's planting trees, picking asparagus,
selling it all, delivering it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: remembering that the tasting room is open,
trying to find the calves that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, when they're born in tall
grass, we try to calve on grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of finding them involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running after them, leaping and catching
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, you missed it if you're
doing that, because it means they're too
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't you been in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually texted one of my employees,
because she's a master's student in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, will you come?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to call on her,
because she's been with us for two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her friend had a seminar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the naivete was actually a
good thing in some ways, because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a fresh approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was also just a lot of really
dumb stuff about, how do we take orders
[SPEAKER_00]: for food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's design a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like, let's use a system that
restaurants use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think we're great systems thinkers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that is the entire concept in
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we totally screwed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we totally tried to make it
up from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was so naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it caused us a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, my husband and I worked every
Friday and every Saturday for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: two years of that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were there to take the heat or to
fix the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you imagine what that did to us,
to our farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I worked probably 20 hours,
not like managing, but like actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, our farm really, really suffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2015 was a great fruit year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really tough year for us,
getting things picked and remembering
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister came to visit in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, I think that the vivid
variety of peaches is ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Matt is on vacation, our farm manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like, uh-huh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, I have to go work in the
taste room for six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pick it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My sister picked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just like, oh my god,
what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to work these shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not think that you're a farmer
the whole time you're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be clean, be ready, and don't be stressed
out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably anyone who's ever
worked in a restaurant once knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's hilarious now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was enormously stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying it's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things that Garrett and I
realized is for us to do a good job for
[SPEAKER_00]: our employees and for our farm,
we actually can't hold those shifts
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of January, we don't work on
Saturdays anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we come in all the time and ruffle
everybody's feathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going over?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're good.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask you about, because you
were pretty young when you started this
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak a little bit to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I try to imagine now your husband
was funny laundering when you guys bought
[SPEAKER_01]: your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into it, was there ever that thought
of being young and like, how do I start
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this such a big thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it something you kind of knew?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people in here who knew
me at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can be like, eh, you were
actually kind of an asshole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we just really thought we
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, honestly, so I'm 35 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a lot of arrogance
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to give tours specifically to
the permaculture design class that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: one held in Ithaca every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember after one of them,
I was just really, we just really got it
[SPEAKER_00]: handed to us constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just so tired and so overworked
and so confused about not our vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our vision was very clear to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were confused about how to maintain
the rest of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep coming back to this, because I
really feel like we traded on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that really helped
me stop trading on that or have a desire
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop trading on it was to have
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realize that I did not want to subject
them to the conditions I'd subjected
[SPEAKER_00]: myself to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did I want to be as an employer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the tasting room,
because you could see it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're stressed out and you interact
with a customer, everybody's stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I've been stepping back from the
tasting room or from working in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to support my staff, I try to treat
them like they're the most important,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of a better word, a better way to
describe it, like customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they're really happy and
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we were really, really naive
about what we were going to need for
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't manage to have children in
those 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our friends have at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying we're not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, I feel like we made a big
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really clear to me at this point
what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that I would do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to make this sound
terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think you have to make those
trades if you're not so silly about some
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that would have been a lot
easier to go back to this is to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of land with any building on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At all.
[SPEAKER_00]: A barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Garrett was like, I'm a builder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want other people's mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like this house was even for
sale or available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't turn that opportunity down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the other farms we looked at,
at some point we were like, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look at farms with buildings
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't want to renovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was foolish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having a place to live that was
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that what the question you asked
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was really the biggest
mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't have a place to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, unfortunately, this was designed
to be our home, is the third floor of this
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we run into some really funny things
with the code officers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's my sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: She comes and works.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just comes and does what I tell her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's Garrett's brother, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I think I've been
remiss in not mentioning, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I should try to get through my
slides, is what a family operation we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about my slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's Garrett on that side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's his brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his family, he's from Dryden.
[SPEAKER_00]: His family does live on our farm now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we build our barn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he built his mother a house,
his mother and a stepfather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're at the bottom of our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then his brother started.
[SPEAKER_00]: His brother's worked for us on and off
almost every year since we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's our cider maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's really good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, because I have known Jimmy
now since he was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would not have told you 10 years ago
that he was going to be a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: award-winning cider maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kind of try to remind people that
we live in this society where there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of truths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of partial truths
used as marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is this place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is true about this place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people tend to be very
inspired by family operations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: truly family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel really lucky to have the
Millers as part of our operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: His stepfather is a master electrician.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I was like, I need a stove wired
in tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I decided to do this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the stove, but I don't know how to
wire it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you come do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the nice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we did know getting into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we would have some level of support
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we actually had no idea the
kind of support we were going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say like Stefan and Tor,
the number of people that have randomly
[SPEAKER_00]: showed up for us and said, we think what
you're doing is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also see that you are ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would like to help you in some way
or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bank, I don't know if anyone has seen
our commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're the poster children for
Tompkins Trust because it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outside, definitely people are
like, you're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, maybe we'll talk about that
in 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're a really big client of Tompkins
Trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted a heteronormative couple
for their commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turned out they kept
interviewing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a really bad speaking voice on
recordings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sound like I'm in a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you should really
interview Garrett.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's much more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, we want a woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, boy, I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's me talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very, very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought they did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they didn't pay us for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like they must give us every
loan we ask for at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could they say no?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, let's see what else we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Ellen, my sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what it looks like inside the
tasting room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of events like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things we're trying to do
is we started out two years ago serving
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% local, which means there were
significant spices missing from our menu,
[SPEAKER_00]: like black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a really funny article
written in Tasting Table about us not
[SPEAKER_00]: using black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's what you got from
your experience here?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbes came and they wrote about the
bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wrote about the bathroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like our messaging, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that's another thing that
we had no idea how you can't talk openly
[SPEAKER_00]: to the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must have a message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you must repeat it five ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we're trying to do is
serve our food and our friends' food,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to be a good customer to other
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also really want to elevate the
fact that Finger Lakes food is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to put Finger Lakes on
the map for cider and for food,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way Napa is on the map for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the purpose of the tasting
room and of any event that we have that's
[SPEAKER_00]: food pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I needed to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really silly at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to say something about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he wrote a book, I don't remember
the name of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he is a current permaculture star.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, I could be wrong, that we share
an inspiration, which is New Forest Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: in Viola, Wisconsin, which is where
Garrett and I spent 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first broad scale
permaculture operation that we could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 100 acres on this basically ridge
and valley, like the driftless area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin, if you're familiar with this,
like the lower western part of Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's these huge valleys and these huge
ridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally plowed, even though these
are extremely steep slopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Mark would say, the owner of that
farm, is that it was where the NRCS wrote
[SPEAKER_00]: the book on contour plowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's true, but that's
what he says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has been trying to replace corn with
a hybrid chestnut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soy with hazelnuts, because originally
that area was a savanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I used to give presentations on
the Good Life Farm, I'd actually spend
[SPEAKER_00]: like 10 minutes talking about New Forest
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the challenge that he was facing
was he's up against how many years of corn
[SPEAKER_00]: and soybean breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's trying to breed food crops on his
own dime, not supported by the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: any schools, and somehow compete against
that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were living at his farm 15 years in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm telling you, we live in a shack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still didn't have a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had two kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like that was fairly
traumatizing for me, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you guys seem kind of
unhappy, even though you're so inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: and inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're 25 years in, and they have
dealt with some of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that farm is still, it's basically a
test concept in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's an elder in the
permaculture movement at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Sheppard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote a really beautiful book that
I cannot remember the name of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we came away from that being like,
OK, so the idea is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the implementation is incredibly
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't be doing any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be growing agriculturally
recognized crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we ended up with the
perennial crop layout that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: asparagus, fruit crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those go to market in a really
straightforward way, even if they go as
[SPEAKER_00]: cider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made me feel like I should have
mentioned Mark earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other thoughts, questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally just ping pong, random,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we see if there's any more slides I
missed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is the farm in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trees are much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are Asian pears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, again, the inside of the
cider house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really strange font that got cut
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I done?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Directly, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a number of big ideas that have
truly failed, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was this collaborative CSA
that we were running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the same idea as the food we
serve in the cider house, which was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone could join our CSA and get a full
diet, because I was working with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: other farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were such small producers,
we couldn't get a low enough price to put
[SPEAKER_00]: our margin on it to run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was two years of really big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that generated for
me was a really incredible marketing list.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between direct marketing turkeys,
which was really easy for years and years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and running the CSA Plus, I sell like 400
or 500 pounds of ginger in one to 10 pound
[SPEAKER_00]: units directly to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we grow 3,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rest of it I wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we buy a fair amount of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not allowed to open this,
like Cornell's, all kinds of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did bring this to share with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our house-made soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use about 300 pounds of our own soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ginger a year for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we make these shrubs,
which you can also have.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: A shrub, who just asked that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A shrub is a very old drink, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's related to sherbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my understanding is that it's Middle
Eastern in origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a way of preserving fruit and
vegetables by macerating them in vinegar
[SPEAKER_00]: and then straining the particulate back
out and using it as a mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very vinegary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell it as a cocktail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of those fun things about
Governor Cuomo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been great for craft beverage and
also a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done this thing where any farm blank
can serve any other farm blank product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're going to start seeing on
the wine trails now is like, where am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who made this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we're going to
probably start selling vodka and gin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the shrubbery, because we have a
shrubbery, which is a cooler where we sell
[SPEAKER_00]: shrubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we probably aren't going to serve
cocktails because I don't want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mostly a really nice cocktail
mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people also, when they are
quitting drinking, buy it so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have something fancy to drink with their
friends who are drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still doing the CSA?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the CSA that we were doing of 100%
our own products was a spring CSA,
[SPEAKER_00]: so March, April, and May, because we have
all of these tunnels, like six of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing was that even with that much
of our own production, there was still so
[SPEAKER_00]: much unpredictability in terms of what's
going to bolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to all of a sudden have
nothing for the CSA this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was always very stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always happened at the end of
April.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why did I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just went back to wholesaling
our greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the thing about the CSA
was we would do you pick strawberries at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People loved coming to our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a really important thing that
I'm still trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the cider house is a
great vehicle for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can justify it in a way that as a
farmer, just being a good host can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're like, I'm wasting my time
literally right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with the cider house, being a good
host is an imperative part of that job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a helpful shift for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have this vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only did it once this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an orchard with sale in January,
where I was like, come, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to be out driving my horses
in circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give your kids rides on
my sled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually did turn into people
wanting to go in and drink in the cider
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a nice place to back
off and not try to exert control,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of what we do at asparagus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you can come and spend no
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to appreciate what we're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want you to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what tends to happen is people
are like, I like this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you do is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I can afford to spend money
here, and sometimes not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you only sell ginger,
you're only going to ever get people who
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really get ginger, which is a
really small segment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more people get alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you were trying to get up and
stop me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wasn't getting up to stop you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'd just like to thank Melissa
again for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is a very busy time here for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for people who came in late,
I'm really happy you came here for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last talk of the semester for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dome in Hell is going to have other events
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a mushroom with that
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coincidingly right now, so there's
probably some people out in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different group, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we have some tea and cake in the
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please feel free to hang out for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put the gingerbread back
there, and you guys can serve yourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to thank Melissa for
coming today.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a production of Cornell
University on the web at cornell.edu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
